. communication is what differentiates our form of government from a dictatorship. in its simplest terms. democracy is a twoway street of communication between elected officials and the public. when i address my young constituents in connecticut. i try to emphasize that point. democracy is an outdoor plant. it only flowers when left in the open. as soon as the doors are closed the trouble startstrouble in the form of watergates. vietnams. and russian wheat deals. but open government does  just happen. it is  automatic. communication can fail at either end of the twoway street. and there are hurdles which must be cleared to permit the round trip of communication between government and the public. it was with that in mind that our founding fathers wrote a first amendment to the constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press. and government is becoming more open all the time. most meetings of congressional committees are  open to the public and many government operations which just a few years ago were considered to be sacred cows are  receiving close scrutiny and public examination. today. i am introducing a piece of legislation that will help to facilitate open communication between the congress and the american people. the congressional advisory legislative line would implement an 800 tollfree telephone number line. within the house information systems "bill status office" to afford the american people with an accessible. immediate service by which they may obtain information relating to the status of pending legislation before the congress.
