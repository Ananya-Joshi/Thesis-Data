 at all. all kinds of students in my city are being transported today. they are poor students who want to get the benefit of the elementary and secondary education act. they have applied and begged on bended knee to be transported precisely on the issue of racial imbalance. because they agree with the supreme court that segregated education. de facto or de jure. is only half an education. a segregated education is just as segregated because of housing patterns. or because it is de jure. or because the authorities want to keep them out. i think we should k. before this amendment is adopted. what we would be denying to students who voluntarily want to be transported. where the student and his parents are begging to get the use of federal education funds to enable that to be done. i gather the answer is "yes." then we can argue the consequences from that point. but i ask the senator whether there is any other answer. in my judgment. the amendment is  susceptible to any other construction.
