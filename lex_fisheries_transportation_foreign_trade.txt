i have desire to argue a matter on which i am  prepared to debate the merits. i assume the senator is. because he proposes it. i should like to ask the senator a very frank question as a colleague of the most friendly kind. i think many of us are  prepared at the moment. sometimes one has to fish or cut bait. may i ask the senator if he would consider it unfriendly if i moved to table the amendment. having a test on whether the senate does or does  wish to consider the matter at this particular juncture. beyond that point. i could  do anything about it if the senate wanted to proceed. i have to make up my own mind on voting. but i do  believe the senate is in a position to controvert or adopt a measure on its merits. as a matter of first impression. which i see in a typewritten amendment. walking into the chamber. and which may have an effectbecause i k how sensitive the foreign trade situation is. especially at this momentfar beyond what we may dream of. weexcept the senator from south dakota and the senator from iowado  k what this means. i ask the senator that question.
