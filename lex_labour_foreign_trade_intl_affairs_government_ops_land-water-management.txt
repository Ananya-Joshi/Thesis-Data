. i want to call to the attention of my colleagues a very thoughtful and perceptive editorial. written by walter lippmann. which appeared in todays washington post. in the editorial mr. lippmann makes a sober appraisal of the newly issued british 5year plan and the problems it attempts to deal with in the british ecoy. he expresses doubt whether any british governmentwhether led by labor or the conservativescould make this plan workable. he makes this statement  on the grounds that the plan is ineffective or too ambitious or out of tune with the times but because britains special situationits global military responsibilities and the international reserve currency role of the pound sterlingwhich makes its domestic ecoic problems vastly different from that of other european nations. because of these special factors and the simultaneous need to modernize the british ecoy britain has  been able to play an effective role as our ally. mr. lippmann takes the position that it is essential for us to have britain as a strong ally and that for this reason the british situation should be of serious concern to the united states. i share mr. lippmanns concern over britain and on august 12 i addressed myself to analyzing britains ecoic situation on the floor of the senate and made several recommendations how the united states in cooperation with con.tinental europe can assist britain to help itself. i am pleased that mr. lippmann sees britains situation very much the same way as i do and i hope that the united states will take the lead in marshaling ecoic support for britain so that britain can take the necessary steps to modernize its ecoy and thereby continue to play its very constructive ecoic and military role in the world. and as a close ally of the united states. i ask unanimous consent that mr. lippmanns editorial be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
