. i support the efforts of senator abd to offer the asbestos school hazard abatement act of 1984 as a floor amendment. products containing asbestos -were used widely in the construction of school buildings during the 1950s and 1960s for fireproofing. soundproofing. and insulating ceilings. pipes. walls. and boilers. as asbestos materials deteriorate with age. tiny particles can be released and. if inhaled. can lead to respiratory ailments and cancer. medical researchers have concluded that exposure to friable asbestos is a health hazard to children and school employees and must be addressed. the environmental protection agency has estimated that as many as 14.000 school buildings may contain hazardous asbestos. posing a risk to 3 million students and 250.000 staff members. school districts across the country have come under increased pressure to take corrective action to remove or encapsulate deteriorating asbestos materials. in many cases. this process can be expensivethe cost of abatement for many schools has been estimated at $100.000. however. it is  a process which school systems can afford to delay. in 1980. congress authorized the department of education to conduct a program offering nterest loans to school districts for asbestos abatement activities. this program has never been funded. and the department lacks the technical expertise to oversee an asbestos detection and removal program. the environmental protection agency last year began enforcement of regulations requiring school districts to inspect for the presence of friable asbestos. and to ify school employees and parentteacher organizations of asbestos problems. the agency has begun to cite schools for failure to comply with this requirement and recently levied its first line for compliance. epa is strongly committed to enforcing its asbestos inspection rules and is cerrently drafting requirements for the abatement of problems which are detected. as a member of the senate committee on environment and public works. which has jurisdiction over epa. i believe epa possesses the technical expertise to administer a program of asbestos abatement in school buildings. the agency is already operating an inspection program and provides technicai guidance to school districts regarding asbestos control and removal. under current rules. school systems are required to make public ification of any asbestos hazards which are detected. in many cases. financially troubled school districts have been reluctant to explore the problem. lacking funds to address the hazard and fearful of making employees and parents apprehensive. such delays could have profound and troubling ramifications for the health of children and school employees. state and local governments must move aggressively to investigate and control the asbestosinschools hazard. i believe it is appropriate for congress to supplement these efforts by making federal resources available to needy school districts with serious asbestos problems. the asbestos school hazard abatement act establishes within the epa a program to help remedy acute asbestos problems in financially troubled school districts. the bill would direct epa to compile and distribute information regarding the health hazards of friable asbestos and the means of abating asbestos problems. the bill also establishes a program through which financial assistance can be provided to school districts undertaking corrective activities. in order to direct scarce federal resources toward those schools in which there is a pressing need for action. the bill calls upon the gover of each state to develop a priority list. ranking schools according to their severity of asbestos hazards and degree of financial need. those schools demonstrating inadequate financial resources to correct asbestos hazards will be eligible for loans and matching grants to help defray the costs of abatement activities. epa has estimated that the total cost of controlling the threat of hazardous asbestos in american schools exceeds $1 billion. this legislation authorizes $50 million in fiscal year 1984. $50 million in fiscal year 1985. and $100 million for each of the 5 subsequent fiscal years. it is  designed to resolve the entire problem. state and local governments must renew their commitment to assist school districts in containing the asbestos hazard. school distr.cts must be prepared to use existing funds or perhaps appeal to their communities for the passage of bond issues to deal with asbestos. this legislation recognizes that alihough the federal government can solve the asbestosinschools iazard. it can provide support to assist financially rtruggling school systems which might  otherwise take corrective action. and in the case of the threat to public health posed by exposure to asbestos. corrective action can wait. i hope my colleagues will join in supporting this amendment when it is offered to s. 1285.e
the managers of this bill obviously recognize the importance of understanding and dealing with the problems of stratospheric ozone depletion. the greenhouse effect and climate change. would they agree to include as part of the fiscal year 1987 nsf appropriation a directive that the nsf shall develop and begin to implement in 1987 a science education program for faculty and students to focus attention on and to promote understanding of the problems of global climate change. the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion. the education program should include. at a minimum. two nsf conferences in 1987 for teachers in elementary. junior high and high schools. as well as undergraduate college teachers. and the creation and distribution of model curricula. films and other science education materials.

 i am referring. of course. to the national environmental education act. sponsored by senator bundick. myself. senators jzrroas. mitchell. cohen. kasten. and others. the concept of environmental education is  new. in 1970. congress passed the national environmental education acta law which was never aggressively implemented by the former department of health. education. and welfare. and which was repealed in 1981. also the united nations sponsored a major intergovernmental conference on environmental education in 1977. yet never has the need for a broad. interdisciplinary approach to environmental education. both in formal settings such as school curricula. and informal channels such as the media. been more urgent than today. unless we can instill in our population. especially the younger generation. an understanding that everyday actions such as garbage disposal and the burning of fossil fuels have a direct impact on our lifesustaining ecosystem. then prospects for solving environmental problems become greatly diminished. until this century. man has been largely incapable of causing irreparable harm to the environment. as americans we inherited a seemingly limitless expanse of land and water. if we used up the available land. we could always push on further west. our oceans seemed to supply us with an inexhaustible supply of food. and always rebounded from the impact of human development. the industrial revolution. however. has dramatically changed this. within the past few decades we have become painfully aware that the collective action of mankind can wipe out plant and animal species. deplete marine life. cause acid to fall from the sky. deplete atmospheric ozone. and create conditions which cause global warming. arguably the most important tool we have to avert these assaults on our environment is education. we must arm the next generation  only with a keen awareness of environmental problems. but also with the skills to solve them. that is why i and a number of my colleagues have introduced the national environmental education act. the goal of this bill is to expand and improve the level of environmental education in our country. increased public understanding of environmental problems can lead to widespread public supprt for measures to address them. students all across the academic spectrumfrom the early grades through postgraduate studieswould benefit from the environmental education provided by this act. under the bill. a major university. or a consortium of universities and profit agencies. will be chosen to establish and operate an environmental education and training program. this program will offer teachers and other professionals training in the development and presentation of environmental education curricula and field studies. funds will be available in the form of grants to local and state education agencies. colleges. and profit organizations to promote environmental education programs and projects. to attract young people toward careers in environmental protection. up to 250 college level internships in federal agencies involved in environmental issues will be made available each year to students. and to recognize excellence in environmental education. the bill creates three awards in ho of these great advocates of the environment: theodore roosevelt. henry david thoreau. and rachel carson. to ensure a cleaner environment for future generations. we must begin to educate children today. the national environmental education act is a positive step in this direction.
for . let me say that it is a place of learning: a place to study. a place to practice ones skills and ones ideas. a place to listen to others and to speak ones mind. it is a place of recreation: a place to play team sports. a place to develop individual talents. a place to sail. or golf. or swima place to do your own thing. chautauqua is a place full of excitement yet offering a restful environment preserved for posterity by people who "use" that environment to the hilt. it is an environment of shade trees. light breezes. cobbled streets where autos are almost unkn. of hills. moss. and music. chautauqua was founded by lewis miller and the reverend dr. john vincent in 1874. as a church school for sunday school teachers. it quickly took hold and looked over its horizon. expanding its activities on every front realizing that all human experience enriches. and is enriched by. the spiritual experiences which were its genesis. during the years that followed. chautauqua has drawn to it people from every state in the union as teachers. as students. as leisure visitors. as dos. it is in new york only in the narrowest sense. it belongs to all of us. next tuesday. august 6. 1974. is the one hundredth anniversary of chautauquas founding. and i offer the joint resolution to salute that occasion.
. as it is in this particular measure. it is really broken into fairly identifiable parts. the first part relates to the young adult conservation corps. which bears. essentially. the stamp of the senator from washington . he worked with congressman meeds in the other body. it sets up a young adult conservation corps which will involve 35.000 youths. 16 to 23 years of age. the corps will be administered by the secretary of labor. the conferees have agreed on $350 million for the period ending september 30. i must say parenthetically that i heard so many observations in my native city of new york last weekend. where we have had this catastrophe of looting and burning. in which people literally prayed for such an agency as the one i have described. it is  happy for us that we are limited to 35.000 youths. i think an agency like this could probably stand 350.000and they could stand it. too. and it would make a major difference in the social climate of our country. the second measure which is encompassed in this conference report relates to a very fine initiative by congressman sarasin of connecticut. endorsed by the house. this seeks a series of pilot plant operation with a guarantee of parttime jobs to poor youths who attend school in order to test. among other concepts. the proposition that youths can be encouraged to remain in school and complete their studies. if given the opportunity to have gainful employment. the $72 million is contemplated for this new program and we hope to try it out in 20 cities and some 440 prime sponsor areas. the third program is one which senator humphrey and i had the ho to author. it seeks to facilitate the transition of youth from school to work. we  find a great deal of the unemployment is attributable to the fact that youth does  have work experience. and such simple things as getting up in the morning. how to brush their teeth. dress and get on the bus and report for work on time. seem to be things people have to learn. our ideas were contained originally in s. 170. we implemented our ideas into the aggregate youth bill upon which we agreed with the administration. this measure requires the 442 prime sponsors in the united states to set aside 22 percent of the funds allocated to them by formula under a particular aspect. subpart 3 of this bill. essentially for inschool youth. the estimate is that there will be about $135 million which will be attributable to that particular setaside. i would like to pay tribute to our beloved colleague. senator hubert humphrey. who stoutly fought for this concept and coauthored it with me and helped very much to bring it into being. the fourth element of our program constitutes a very gifted element. introduced by our colleague from vermont
