 pompldou to recall the heroic. historic role of france as protector of israel as a showcase of democracy and freedom in the middle east. i also urge our government to initiate an international aviation conference through the united nations to determine what steps can be taken to bring the strength of all nations to insure that continued hijacking. plaguing. and plundering and murder of people on international flights to israel. cuba. or whatever nation is unthinkable. it is unconscionable to stand by while flagrant violation of international order is being exercised daily by terrorists. we can hope for peace in the middle east. in the sky. on the sea. or on the land until the people of israel are granted the elemental right to be a nation in the eyes of their neighbors. we can longer censure selfdefense and excuse terrorism either for reasons of morality or our own national interest for peace in the area.

 and the soviet union agree to a reciprocal opening of consulates. then the convention before us will represent the ground rules and legal framework for the protection and services envisaged. like other agreements of its kind. this convention guarantees immediate ification of arrests of citizens of the sending state. and provides for consulate access to the arrested citizen without delay. the convention differs from earlier consular conventions in that it provides full immunity for all consular officers and employees from criminal jurisdiction in the receiving state. the purpose of this provision is to remove the constant threat of false charges and reprisals and to allow consular personnel to do their job. about 18.000 americans annually travel to the soviet union. this compares with about 900 soviet citizens traveling in the united states. past experience demonstrates that our citizens need protection. this treaty will give it to them. in closing. i reiterate that the meaning and significance of this convention go beyond its specific terms and provisions. this treaty and others like it are the very stuff of peace. the very foundation of the rule of law.
