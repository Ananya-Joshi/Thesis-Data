s committee for hungarian refugee relief. headed by mr. tracy voorbees. is evidence of this rededication. we are providing refuge in our country for thousands of hungarians who fled the soviet terror. among whom are some of the best and most courageous of their young people. today. thousands of american communities are receiving these gallant refugees in a rarely equalled display of spiritual kinship. i k it is the desire of the american people. and of this body. that we should do all that we legitimately can to be of assistance to the hungarian nation in its fight for freedom as we were in giving haven to its refugees. we all want to help the people of hungary. and in all the satellites. realize their dream of freedom. in this connection i welcome the anncement made a few hours ago in new york of the formation of the national representation of free hungary. headed by miss anna kethly. minister of state of the nagy regime. the last legal government of hungary. as i understand. one of the functions of the group will be to present evidence before the hearings of the special committee on the problem of hungary set up by the general assembly of the united nations. in other ways. too. it should be invaluable in helping to keep the facts of the tragic situation in hungary before the people of the world. i am confident that miss kethly and her associates. including gen. bela kiraly. defender of budapest. and mr. joseph kovago. mayor of that great city. will find that their efforts are as wholeheartedly supported by the american people as has been the great humanitarian work of resettling the refugees.
