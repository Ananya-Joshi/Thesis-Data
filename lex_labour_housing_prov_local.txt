. the problem of suburban land use is one which is of increasing importance today. as more people move into our suburban areas. it becomes very important to assure that middle and lower income groups have the opportunity to move to those areas if they desire to do so. i have introduced a bill . the urban land improvement and housing assistance act. in an attempt to meet some of the problems of urban growth. one of the features of that bill would make federal grants available to suburban communities to assist them in meeting the increased costs of schools. sewers. and other facilities which may result from the construction of moderate- and lowincome housing. this provision in the bill has received favorable comment from wcbstv in new york city in an editorial on december 15. 1969. the editorial also recommended the examination of other specific proposals to encourage the construction of moderate- and lowincome housing. i ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the recoad.
