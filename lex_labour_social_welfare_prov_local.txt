 i. too. would like to join in tribute to dr. sullivan and also to pay tribute to those who have been indefatigable in the pursuit of the cause. in which persons like senator humphrey. senator boggs. and senator pearson have joined. in my capacity as a member of the labor and public welfare committee. i have seen his work and have marveled at the way in which. without paying stipends. the oics get more people helped and more for them than under the manpower training programswhich is dismaying and frustratingfor which they have to pay stipends. so attractive is the idea of business and trainees working together in order to have a place at the end of the road. this is a very gifted program. i have seen it at work in bedfordstuyvesant. which program robert kennedy and i and mayor lindsay founded. i have seen it in parts of my old congressional district in manhattan. and it is extraordinary. it enlists the enthusiasm of the trainee and the enthusiasm of the local business community with tremendous effect. i can assure the senator that the greatest tribute to the rev. leon sullivan is that in the manposer training bill. if i have anything to do with it. we will see to it that adequate provision is made so that this great movement may exercise its full scope in training. and  be limited by the inadequacy of resources.
 last year that dos  change it. this bill is necessary to preserve the taxexempt status of the new york city municipal pension systems while they affirmatively participate in the resolution of the new york city financial crisis.
