. i favored a flexible percentage of parity price supports in the house of representatives. where i had the ho to serve for 8 years. i felt that the flexible parity support price idea was essential. both from the point of view of the tax burden and the consumers price point of view. and when operated in conjunction with other programs. such as the disposal of surpluses abroad. industrial experimentation and research. husbandry of land. conservation practices. and rural credit. all of which would represent an effective farm program for the country. i am of the same mind . but i feel that the concept to which i am a party must stand or fall by its ability to withstand stresses and strains. accordingly i shall support this resolution because i believe. in respect to the dairy farmer. that there is particular stress and strain . i see it reflected in my state. which is the second largest dairying state in the nation. i have a deep feeling that the support price reduction which is so imminent is directly related to the requirements of law rather than to the requirements of ecoics. therefore. i shall vote for the resolution in order to give an opportunity for the letter of the law to catch up with the ecoics of the situation.
