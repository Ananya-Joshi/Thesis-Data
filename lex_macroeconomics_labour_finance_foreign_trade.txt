. you will see how one potent and exciting idea can engender otherssuch as the proposal to utilize the framework of the proposed american corporate technical assistance program to provide periods of internship in the united states for potential managerial talent from the developing countries. when we consider that in the fiscal year 1958 only slightly more than 4.000 technical and managerial trainees from these countries came to the united states under ica auspices. and only about 300 came here under private industry auspices. we can see the large need that must be served. the concept of technical cooperation is relatively inexpensive and. at the same time. without price. for it teaches men and women to use what they have. and it brings into close contact and mutual respect the men and women who are the genius of our ecoic system. and upon whose ability the freedom of a score of nations and a billion people depends. in testimony on december 2. 1958. i brought mr. fultons proposal to enlist american industry in this great effort to the attention of the subcommittee on foreign trade policy of the house ways and means committee.  i should like to commend it to the attention of the senate and the nation.
