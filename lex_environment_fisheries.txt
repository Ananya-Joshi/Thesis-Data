 of the subcommittee. the gentleman from michigan . the gentleman from washington and the gentlemen from new york for their initiative on this vital conservation measure. this bill enjoys the support of gover rockefeller and the new york state conservation commissioner. stewart kilbourne. it is my hope that it will have the strongest bipartisan backing. the bill before us. considerably reduced in scope from the original version. would authorize a 2year study and inventory of the nations estuaries and waters of the great lakes by the secretary of the interior in cooperation with the states and other federal agencies. the study and report. to be submitted to the congress. must be completed later than january 30. 1970. at a cost  to exceed $750.000 for fiscal year 1969 and $350.000 for fiscal year 1970. in addition. with respect to certain publicly owned lands on long island. n.y.. which were studied by the secretary in conjunction with the state of new york in 1961 and 1965. the secretary would be authorized to enter into an agreement with new york or any political subdivision thereof for the permanent management. development. and administration of such areas. throughout the nation. estuarine areas have both conservation and ecoic value. estuaries. as marginal sea and land areas. are the environment for many natural resources. including large populations of wildfowl. such as ducks. geese. swans. rail. and snipe. many of our most valued commercial species of fish spend at least a portion of their lives in estuarine areas. including prawns. menhaden. bluefish. oysters. soft clams. blue crabs. and diamondback terrapins. it is estimated that. in 1960. estuarinedependent seafood resources supported about 90.000 commercial fishermen at the rate of about 2.8 billion pounds. specifically. in terms of the long island wetlands. the area comprises extensive marshes and bays some 15 miles long and 31/2 miles wide. including hempstead and south oyster bays. the commercial and recreational value of the finfish. shellfish. waterfowl. and shorebirds that inhabit this area is emous and the demand for these resources is increasing. a report by the u.s. fish and wildlife service indicates that some 29 percent of the long island wetlands have been destroyed between 1954 and 1964. and an accelerated rate of wetlands destruction will continue unless a positive program of acquisition and management is undertaken. this legislation would make possible such a program. when a political subdivision other than a state desires to enter into a management agreement with the department of the interior. such agreement must have the approval of the gover. if we are to save more of the valuable estuarine areas of the united states. a much larger undertaking is clearly required. this legislation is but a first small stepyet. if we postpone even this minimal beginning any longer. the opportunity to preserve these resources may well pass us by.
. today we are considering s. 736. a bill to p~rovide for the control of illegally taken fish and wildlife. kn as the j.acey act amendments of 1981. this legislation represents a major effort to provide for the effective enforcement of existing fish and wildlife conservation laws. the need for such a bill was welldocumcnted in hearings held before the committee on environment and public works on april 1 6f this year. as well as during the 96th congress. we heard from every group that sought to testify on this legislation andthe support for a bill that will provide the tools needed to effectively contiol. the massive illegal trade in fish. wildlife and plants was unanimous. the committee accepted many recommendations .of the witnesses and made a number of changes in the bill in response to the testimony received during the course of our hearings. as amended and reported by the coinmittee on environment and public works. the bill has the strong support of numerous groups such as the international association of fish and game agencies. the wildlife management institute. the national wildlife federation. the national rifle association. and a host of environmental groups. the appeal of this bill transcends traditional ideological barriers and there is significant opposition to it. cosponsors of the -bill include senators baker. mc-
. s. 1352 authorizes appropriations to carry out conservation programs on military reservations and public lands under the sikes act during fiscal years 1986. 1987. and 1988. the sikes act was enacted by congress in 1960 and amended in 1968. 1974. 1978. and 1982. the act originally authorized the secretary of defense to carry out a program of planning. development. maintenance. and coordination of fish and wildlife conservation on military reservations. these installations encompass over 25 million acres. the programs were to be in accordance with a cooperative plan mutually agreed upon by the secretary of the defense. the secretary -of the interior. and the appropriate agency in the state in which the installation is located. department of defense regulations require that fish and wildlife management plans be executed for all military installations which contain land and water areas suitable for the conservation and management of fish and wildlife resources. suitability is determined after consultation with the u.s. fish and wildlife service and the director of the state fish and wildlife agency in which the installation is located. to date. more than 19 million acres of fish and wildlife -habitat have ..been covered by thesecooperative plans. in 1968. congress amended the sikes act to include public outdoor recreation programs on military reservations and. for the first time. authorized appropriations to the secretaries of defense and interior to carry out the purposes of the act. in 1974. congress amended the act to require that the cooperative wildlife plans provide for fish and wildlife habitat management. range rehabilitation. and the control of offroad vehicle traffic. -these 1974 amendments also established title ii of the act. which directed the secretaries of the interior and agriculture. in cooperation with the appropriate state agencies.- to plan. develop. maintain. and coordinate programs for the conservation and rehabilitation of lands under their jurisdiction (bureau of land management and forest service lands) and lands under the jurisdiction of the atomic energy commission [aec].  the department of energy. and the national aeronautics and space administration [nasa]. title ii of the sikes act also provides that any state agency may agree with the secretaries of the interior and agriculture that individual will be permitted to hunt. trap. or fish on any interior or agriculture lands covered by the act unless the individual possesses a valid public land management area stamp. this stamp would be in addition to regular state hunting. fishing. and trapping permit or licenses. any fees collected from the sale of this stamp must be utilized solely to carry out conservation and rehabilitation programs on the lands subject to the agreement and to defray the expenses associated with printing and issuing the stamp. in 1978. congress reauthorized the sikes act. raising the authorization level under title i from $2 million to $3 million for the secretary of the interior and. under title ii. increasing the authorization for the secretary of agriculture from $10 million to $12 million. the secretary of defenses authorization of $1.5 million under title i and the secretary of the interiors authorization of $10 million under title ii remained constant. in 1982. congress once again amended the sikes act by extending the authorization levels through 1985. titles i and ii were amended to provide adequate protection for endangered. or threatened species of fish. wildlife. and plants. the nature of the cooperative agreements referred to in the sikes act was clarified by ing that these documents are the vehicle through which the federal and state agencies mutually agree in principle on fish -and wildlife programs rather than the legal instruments defined under the federal grant and cooperative agreement act. in addition. title ii was amended to allow the secretary of agriculture to make purchases and contracts for property and services from. and -provide - assistance to.. the state agencies without- going through the advertising and competitive bidding requirements under the federal property and administrative services act. as reported by the committee on environment and public works on june 25. 1985. s. 1352 extends the existing authorization levels for each of fiscal years 1986. 1987. and 1988. these authorization levels are $1.5 million annually to the secretary of defense and $3 million annually to the secretary of the interior to carry out the purposes of the sikes act on military lands. also authorized are $10 million annually to the. secretary of the interior and $12 million annually to the secretary of agriculture to carry outthe purposes of the sikes act on other public lands. including u.s. forest service. bureau of land management. national " aeronautics and space administration. and department of energy lands.

. i am pleased to join with many of my friends and colleagues from new england in cosponsoring this amendment. it addresses an important natural resource issue: the conservation of homarus americanus. the american lobster. as my colleagues k. the waters of and around the united states have an abundance of renewable fishery resources that are extremely valuable to the ecoy of the country. to fully realize the potential of this resource. the congress approved the magnuson fishery management and conservation act of 1976. the key words rre "conservation" and "management." we recognized then that for the health of this vast resource. we must take care  to abuse it. to keep the u.s. lobster population at. a steady level. u.s. lobster fishermen have agreed to state and federal minimumsize requirements. as well as prohibition against the taking of eggbearing lobster. for these fishermen. abiding by the requirements is in theirand the nationslong term environmental and ecoic investment: the harvesting restrictions guarantee a steady. healthy lobster population. i am pround that american fishermen are conservation minded. we are leaders in conservation measures for this species. but we cant singlehandedly ensure that the homarus amercanus population survives. a uniform conservation standard for all american lobsterregardless of originis needed. this amendment will modify the magnuson act to prohibit in interstate commerce the shipping or selling of any live lobster that are short. that is. do  meet u.s. minimumsize stand. ards. at the same time. it preserves states ability to set minimum size and other standards under the magnuson act. the merchant marine and fisheries committee in the house has already adopted a similar proposal. i believe this measure will promote responsible fishery management and conservation principles. ember 17. 1989 coi%
. i rise in strong support of s. 1491 the partnerships for wildlife act and would like to commend senator mitchell for introducing this bill and for his continued leadership on fish and wildlife issues. as we look toward preserving our natural heritage it is important to recognize the value of the diversity of plant and animal life that are integral components of our native environment. this bill will help support efforts to conserve the 80 percent of our fish and wildlife species that are  currently protected under any law. it is my hope that through research. education. management. and conservation efforts we can prevent these species from ever becoming threatened or endangered. this measure incorporates a partnership concept for game fish and wildlife conservation. it is modeled after the partnerships that been utilized very effectively to preserve wetlands under the th american wetlands conservation act. which was also authored by senator mitchell. in addition. since 1986. the national fish and wildlife foundation has matched $22 million in congressional appropriations with $40 million in federal donations. that is a pretty good returnalmost 2 to 1--and has been used to fund over 540 partnership projects to improve our plant. fish. and wildlife resources. the remarkable success of public/private partnerships is due to the cooperative efforts of dedicated people from private businesses. conservation organizations. and state and federal government agencies. it is also indicative of widespread public support for preservation of our natural environment and concern for the decline of many fish and wildlife species. the u.s. fish and wildlife service reports that 98 million adults. more than onehalf of the adult population of this country. participated in fish and wildlife related activities in 1991--contributing $59.5 billion to the national ecoy. last year more than 76 million americans enjoyed consumptive wildlife related activities such as feeding birds. observing * and photographing wildlife. the wildlife conservation and appreciation fund. established by this legislation. will help the public and private sectors work side by side to preserve native biological diversity and to provide many more opportunities for americans to share in the enjoyment of our fish and wildlife species in their natural habitat.
does section 102(b) of h.r. 1425 prohibit. impede. or alter in any way the secretarys rasponalbilities. and his ability to carry out his responsibilitles. under the endangered species act or any other federal law relating to fish or wildlife.
my second question is whether anything in this actother than the provision repealing the sunset of the moratorium authorityamends or otherwise affects the provisions of the atlantic striped bass conservation act.
madam president. i rise in support of s. 476. a bill i introduced 1 year ago. to reauthorize the national fish and wildlife foundation establishment act. the foundation has proven extremely effective. it advances the conservation of our natural resources through the formation of inative partnerships between the public and private sectors. this is an organization that deserves our support. the foundation was established as a federally chartered but private and independent. profit organization to serve as a link between government and private efforts to conserve our fish and wildlife resources. it is authorized to receive private donations and matching federal appropriations to benefit fish and wildlife conservation. since the foundation was established in 1984. it has funded over 870 conservation projects all over the nation and in 12 foreign countries. the foundation has used the partnership approach to fund fish and wildlife projects valued at over $108 millionutilizing only $32 million in federal appropriations. dollar for dollar the foundation is one of the most effective organizations for implementing conservation projects. matching every federal dollar with $2 in federal contributions. as impressive as these numbers may be. the foundations role as a catalyst for conservation efforts goes beyond the specific projects funded. the foundation has been at the forefront of the effort to form partnerships between government agencies. conservation organizations. individuals. and corporations interested in conservation of our natural resources.  only do these partnerships help to stretch scarce federal dollars. but they encourage greater public participation in conservation programs. setting the stage for future initiatives. the foundation has also been instrumental in getting important projects off the ground by providing seed money and expertise. including the th american waterfowl management planan initiative to benefit declining populations. of waterfowl. partners in flighta program to conserve neotropical migratory birds. including songbirds. and conservation training and education programs. the bill also authorizes the lansfer of the senecaville national fish hatchery to the state of ohio. for use by the ohio department of natural resources for its fishery resources management program. in addition. the bill authorizes the u.8. fish and wildlife service to make grants--subject to the availability of appropriationsto establish the brownsville wetlands policy center at the port of brownsville. tx. the center is to be operated and maintained by the port of brownsville and the university of texas at brownsville. with our support. the foundation will continue to be in the forefront of inative and costeffective methods to advance the conservation of our fish and wildlife. i urge my colleagues to support the passage of s. 476.
 inated ms. clark on july 9. and i am pleased to report that last thursday. july 24. the committee on environment and public works reported out the ination. jamie clark is an outstanding candidate for the tasks at hand. she has worked closely with the environment committee staff and committee members staff on the endangered species act and other tough issues. i have heard hing but glowing reports of her ability to work with the adminigtration and congress. which will serve her well. if confirmed. throughout her educational and professional experiences. she has been involved on a daily basis with the principles of fish and wildlife management. jamie clark has worked with the fish and wildlife service for over 8 years. both at the regional level and at headquarters. for the past 4 years of her tenure with the service. she has held the position of associate director of ecological services. prior to joining the fish and wildlife service. jamie clark was the lead technical authority for fish and wildlife management on u.s. army installations worldwide. from 1984 until 1988. she managed the natural and cultural resources program within the national guard. she also was a research biologist for the u.s. army medical research institute and worked for the national institute for urban wildlife as a wildlife biologist. jamie clarks educational background is equally impressive and suits her well to the position of fish and wildlife service director. she holds a masters degree (ms) in wildlife ecology from the university of maryland and a bachelors degree (bs) in wildlife biology.. if confirmed. jamie clark will be responsible for developing and carrying out policies to conserve. protect. and enhance the nations fish and wildlife and their habitats. a number of challenging tasks fall on the shoulders of the fish and wildlife service director. including the management of the national wildlife refuge system. the implementation of the endangered species act. fish hatchery management. recreational fishing programs. management of indiges and exotic species. conservation and management of migratory waterfowl and wild birds. and the list of responsibilities goes on. the fish and wildlife service is an agency with the wonderful but difficult task of serving as an advocate for fish and wildlife. it must protect these public resources in the face of much criticism and question. the service is charged with fulfilling its own mission in light of competing and sometimes conflicting mandates. it also must address the contentious issues of private property rights. water rights. and takings. the service has done a remarkable job in recent years of developing initiatives that deal with many of these issues. the internal guidance documents for permits. the new safe harbor. candidate conservation and "urprises" policies. the policy for native american rights. and the streamlining initiatives for federal agencies have all led to better implementation of the endangered species act. better public relations. and ultimately better protection for the species. i am confident that jamie clark has the experience. insight. and the. strength to lead the fish and wildlife service to continue these initiatives and develop new ones through the challenges ahead. thank you.
. today i introduce legislation to reauthorize the national fish and wildlife foundation establishment act of 1984. this legislation makes -mportant changes in the foundations charter. changes that i believe will allow the foundation to build on its fine record of providing funding for conservation of our nations fish. wildlife. and plant resources.
madam president. the committee on environment and public works favorably reported out this bill last may. the area in question was correctly mapped as an undeveloped coastal barrier. but extraordinary miscommunication at the federal. state and local levels failed to ensure that the appropriate maps were being provided to the public. as a result. when the landowner inquired from colleton county about the status of his land with respect to the coastal barrier resources system. he was given inaccurate information. the sole reason that we supported the changes made by senator hollings bill was because of the unprecedented and unique procedural circumstances in this case. and we do  anticipate -that there would be other instances that would warrant similar changes. the law only requires coastal barrier resources system maps to be on file at the united states fish and wildlife service. and reporting this bill does  imply that landowners should rely on maps filed at any other location to determine whether or  their property is located within the coastal barrier resources system.

. on december 11. 1974. the senate first passed a marine fisheries protection bill. since that time. the need for this legislation grows as the reckless harvesting of our valuable fishery resources continues unabated off our nations coastline. present international fishing agreements and current negotiations between the united states and other countries have contributed to ineffective regulation and control of foreign fishing efforts. the administration espouses empty promises based on wishful thinking that all will be well with our fish conservation problems if we only wait until the conclusion of the next session of the law of the sea conference. although i fully support the efforts of the conference. i suspect that if we wait any longer for the expected final treaty. our already sorely depleted fishery stocks will be exhausted to the brink of extinction. the purposes of the bill to protect and conserve our fishery resources are twofold. first. it would extend a 200mile "fishery conservation zone" from the nations coastline. within this zone the united states would have management jurisdiction over anadromous species that spawn in u.s. rivers and streams and over the u.s. continental shelf. second. s. 961 sets out to establish and enforce a national fishery management program. by establishing management authority at 200 miles. the united states will be able to control the massive foreign fishing effort that  severely depresses a vital proteinrich food source for the whole world. expanding the fishing limit to 200 miles would help revitalize the american fishing industry. especially in connecticut and new england. we only have to look at the foreign fishing efforts along the southern new england coastline. that includes connecticut. to see how they are dangerously overfishing our valuable fish resources to the detriment of the u.s. fishing industry. since foreign fleets began their massive operations off southern new england in 1960. the catch of american fishermen has dropped from 100 percent to an alarming 11.8 percent. by 1965. the soviet union was scouring over half a million tons of fish per year from new englands rich georges bank areafar exceeding the american catch. by 1970. the total yearly catch by the entire foreign fleet had grown to more than a million tons. it is expected that this bill establishing a 200mile zone and a fishery management and conservation mechanism could result in a threefold domestic fish catch from the thwest atlantic area. the resulting increase could generate revenues totalling $750 million for the new england area alone. of that amount. $296 million would be personal income. this is income that would create new jobs in new england for shipbuilders. fishermen. processors. suppliers. and retailers. it must be emphasized that this measure is interim in nature. the bill will provide an immediate remedy for a dangerous situation until an agreement is codified by the law of the sea conference. i see other alternative but to take this emergency action to manage our fishing stocks within the 200mile conservation limit. i urge my colleagues to support s. 961 as the quickest and best method to halt foreign rape of our offshore resources so that american waters will  become aher dead sea area.
. it is important that the expertise of area residents who k the shores and care about the daily events there be made available to the whole nation. i ask the senate to make the cape cod national seashore commission a permanent part of our conservation system.
if i may finish this. to do the comprehensive planning which the federal government has the right to do unilaterally. does that  also cover conservation and rehabilitation of wildlife. fish and game. that is what it says at the top of page 3. line 3. in other words. it seems to me that that is exactly what they do have. they speak of being in cooperation with state agencies. et cetera. but they do  mandate the state concurrence. as they would do in a cooperative plan. apparently the two titles. that is. this one which we are talking about  and the comprehensive plan and the cooperative agreement. seem to have different meanings. all i am saying is that whatever option the federal government has. if it can come to an agreement with the state. then the federal government should utilize its option. whatever it might be.
