two years ago a young. upstate new york congressman was appointed to fill the tragically uncompleted term of one of the countrys most dynamic senators. charlie goodell is  the kind of man who is intimidated by the magnitude of the task at hand or by the complexity of the issues confronting him. representing an entire state. instead of a single district. he was confronted more directly with the multitude of problems facing our land. and he set about to correct them ... it takes courage for a freshman senator to differ with a president of his own party on the major foreign policy question of the day. but charlie goodell believed the war was wrong. and he became an outstanding leader in the effort to reassert congressional control over our foreign commitments. charlie goodell believed that as a nation we were spending too much on military hardware. and he helped spearhead the drive to reduce our defense commitments. to cut out unnecessary and duplicative programs. and to save on scarce resources for the projects that really were needed. charlie goodell has been deeply disturbed about events in the middle east. and he has been foremost among those calling for direct negotiations and control of the arms traffic. most recently. he introduced the first bill in the senate dealing with airline hijackings. as a senator. charlie goodell has also been deeply concerned with the major domestic problems facing the american people. he has introduced pioneer legislation in the fields of criminal corrections. drug abuse. water and sewer facilities. and low and moderate income housing. charlie goodell is a farsighted legislator. attuned to present needs. and looking beyond them to solutions which will insure a better future. his contribution to the senate and to the country in two short years has been pheenal. his efforts in the years to come will surely fulfill this early promise.
