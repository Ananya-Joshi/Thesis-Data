. information continues to be published in our press with respect to executions and sentences of executions of jews in the soviet union for alleged offenses against laws regarding black marketing and currency speculation. we have  heard anything officially from the soviet union or its representatives on this subject. withstanding the constant publication of this information. today. in the new york herald tribune. there is a list of 20 of these doomed people. identified by name and with the name of the courts which allegedly had sentenced them. the article also refers to the fact that intercession has been made with the russian authorities by distinguished citizens throughout the world. pointing out to them. that. in some cases. as the newspaper states. they were tried under ex post facto laws. that the punishment which was meted out is unusually severe. considering the penalty. and in comparison with the jurisprudence of civilized countries of the free world. i have on previous occasions pointed out that a very special point has been made of singling out jews as the culprits who are allegedly committing these criminal acts in synagogues. and so forth. this has been disseminated in such a way as to incite what we k to be endemic and longstanding antisemitic feeling in russia. which existed long before the communists came to power in czarist days. i ask unanimous consent that the news story to which i have referred. together with the tragic list of the condemned persons. be made a part of my remarks and printed in the record.
