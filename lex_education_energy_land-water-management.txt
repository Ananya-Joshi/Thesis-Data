.i am a cosponsor of senator gortons amendment to begin daylight saving. time the first sunday in april. i hope my coll eagues will join me in supporting this measure that will improve the quality of life of millions of americans. f under current law. april sunrises are the earliest of the year. the effect of this amendment would be to transfer an hour of daylight from the earily morning to the early evening for 3 weeks in april. americans would then have an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day for safer commuting. for play time for children. for shopping. and for leisure time with their families. for those 400.000 americans who suffer from night blindness the extra evening hour of daylight will have a very important impact on their lives. in 1974 and 1975 the u.s. department of transportation found that extended daylight saving time reduced electric power consumption. saving 100.000 barrels of oil per day. discouraged violentcrime. and reduced traffic fatalities. an extension would also stimulate business activity. more than 8.300 companies from a wide variety of industries have joined forces as the daylight savings time coalition. the coalition estimates that an extension could generate billions of dollars in additional revenues and lead to the creation of many new jobs. those who live on the western edge of a time zone may be concerned that their children would leave for school in the dark. the amendment takes this concern into account by limiting theextension to april. during those 3 weeks in april thesun would rise and set about the same time it does  in midaugust and early september. time is our most valuable but fleeting resource. an extension will enable americans to use and enjoy their time more fully. and that is why i ask my colleagues to support the extension of daylight savings time to the first sunday in april.
