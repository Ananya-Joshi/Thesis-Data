. i should like to express my support of the senator from alabama on this subject. this measure is only making good the promise we made to veterans i have heard the figure of $15 billion mentioned time and again as to the cost of higher interest rates. it must. of course be juxtaposed to what the american working man has been saved in terms of inflation which is probably a multiple $15 billion. however. low interest rates are characteristic of our vital ecoy and should be the m. but. i do  think this is the place for that argument on interest rates. we promised the veteran a 4 percent interest rate because of his special status. because he lost essential years of his earning power. i am for making good on our promise. i think that is all the senator from alabama is doing in advocating giving the veteran a loan opportunity for housing. it is true that this bill would  greatly benefit my section of the country. in the large cities there are also great problems involved in raising money for mortgages. however. the bill would help to take the strain off the mortgage market to a certain extent. but whether it did or . the point is that we are redeeming our promise to at least some of the veterans. i am glad the senator has brought about an accord to get this bill passed.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record a table entitled "defense expenditures of nato countries as percentages of gross national product at current market prices. calendar year 1962."
