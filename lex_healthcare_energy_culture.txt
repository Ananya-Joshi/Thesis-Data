. i would like to take a moment to ackledge the fine accomplishments of the retired senior volunteer programs trsvp] across the nation. our senior volunteers greatly deserve the thank you that they received during national volunteer week. april 1723. 1988. * all over this country. our seniors are contributing their time and energy to desperately needed community work in hospitals. health agencies. senior centers. and nursing homes. they give of themselves to people of all ages. in rhode island. there are 360 rsvp volunteers just in the providence area. they range in age from 60 to 93 years and serve at 61 area profit agencies and institutions. their total time volunteered will add up to an incredible 70.000 hours this year. those valuable hours will be spent in a host of activities including helping with literacy programs. escorting wheelchair patients. knitting infant hats. teaching arts and crafts. and serving meals. in addition. rsvp participants volunteer in the business community as clerical aids. board members. mailers of newsletters. processors of campaign pledges. and consultants in engineering and public relations.  only are these senior volunteers helping others in their community. but they are also helping themselves. they feel productive and needed ecause they are productive and neeed. they are role models to younger generations. i am certain their involvement will encourage younger people to involve themselves in their community and to take the time to make a difference. these generous people are the backbone of our community. they deserve a resounding thank you for "sharing the experience of a lifetime."
