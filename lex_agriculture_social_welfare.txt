. city dwellers are beginning to ask some very embarrassing questions about continuing high food costs in view of secretary brannans statement on friday that the government will have to jettison. burn. or otherwise waste 70.000.000 bushels of potatoes in connection with the 1949 potato pricesupport program. this is the culmination of a series of other statements on all kinds of farm commodities from wheat to dried eggs. it is especially eworthy that this statement comes side by side with evidence of rising relief costs in the big cities. for instance. in my own new york city the public assistance case load  provides for 328.469 persons with 387.324 estimated for 1951. and the federal governments share of this public assistance relief budget is $44.046.625. agricultural policy  obviously is  just a problem for farmers. it is time we had a department of consumers in the federal establishment and consumers legislative committees in both houses of the congress to deal with just such problems as that raised by secretary brannan in connection with potatoes. pressure and special interest groups will then have finally brought on their appropriate countereffort in the synthesis of all groups into onefor we are all consumers. farmers should have a particular interest in aiding consumers at this point because opposition is mounting to the whole agricultural policy in spite of the fact that some farm price support is essential to the countrys ecoy. it is excesses that city dwellers are worrying about  as shown by the potato. dried egg. and similar programs which have piled up vast surpluses side by side with the existence of vast unsatisfied human needs in our own and other free countries.
i thank the senator. i am " doing this idly. there will be other farm "bills before us. i think it is useful to let it be kn that we are interested in having a food stamp bill enacted into law. . i withdraw my amendment.
