. late last year h. i. romnes. chairman of the board of the american telephone & telegraph co.. delivered a most challenging speech on the role of business in community development. this lecture. sponsored by colorado college under a grant by shepards citations. was part of the h. chase stone memorial lecture series. in his speech. mr. romnes emphasized the role which business must play in creating a sense of community in our urban society. in particular. he referred to the obligation of business to sponsor and encourage employee volunteer efforts and to train and hire underqualifled people. i especially invite attention to mr. romnes statement that: business has much to offer in management skills that can help solve administrative problems in educational systems and other municipal affairs. i have long urged private enterprise to make available its managerial and technical skills in meeting urban problems. and i am pleased that so distinguished a leader of the business community has advocated this in a most forceful and persuasive manner. i ask unanimous consent that this provocative statement be printed in the record.
