s council on youth opportunity informs me that camping programs for the underprivileged. although providing enriching experiences for the children. are too costly to be attempted on a fullscale basis. undc2 some community action programs. private profit camping organizations have received federal funds as a delegate agency. however. due to the fact that cap agencies have multiproblemsolving programs to operate. activities involving camping programs have been slight. my bill is  a substitute plan for existing federal programs. instead. it solicits the private sector to supplement the federal funds expended for camping programs on a 2toi ratio. the funds of existing federal programs are characteristically allocated to a public. local agency. my bill allocates funds to a private organization. my procedure. i believe. is a necessary addition to the already established federal programs. i feel. . that it is time for the federal government to actively pursue a path which would involve the private sector of our nation in a more active role than that which it has previously taken. the possibilities of this bill are numerous. for example. a group of citizens in a small community could raise funds to send some of the underprivileged children in their area to a private camp. the government would match the funds up to onethird. the local citizens would be receiving incentive through federal assistance. while the child would spend part of the summer with companions from various different socioecoic backgrounds. learning camping skills and having the refreshing experiences which camp life brings. as i pointed out with respect to the camp safety bill. h.r. 10628. which i introduced on june 7. 1967. there are  some 15.000 day. resident. and travel camps in the united states providing for some 6 million campers. the parents of that many children must be right in determining that camps can build sound minds in a healthy body. on july 19 this body passed an antiriot bill. but we must concentrate our efforts on establishing the necessary programs to alleviate the causes of these riots. and eliminating the conditions which breed chaos. poverty. and destruction in our cities. there follows a list of overnight camps available for new york citys needy childrenincluding camp placement and referrals: albany houses (see stuyvesant community center).
