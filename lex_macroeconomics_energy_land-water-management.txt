. i would like to engage the managers of he fiscal year 2002 energy and water development appropriations bill on the issue of funding for the estuary restoration act. along with senators warner. lieberman. and smirh of new hampshire. i have offered an amendment that would provide $2 million in funding for the implementation of the estuary act. enacted last year. this bipartisan law establishes the estuary habitat restoration program with the goal of restoring one million acres of estuary habitat. we understand the budgetary constraints that the appropriations committee is operating under as this bill is being considered by the senate. it is my hope that the managers can identify funding for the implementation of the estuary restoration act during the conference with the house.

. as congress continues to grapple with strategies for coping with our energy problems. in new england one project is being strongly suggested as a regional solution. i refer to the dickeylincoln hydroelectric project. which comprises the construction of two dams on the st. john river. one a hydropower facility and one a regulating structure. supporters of this nearly $1 billion proposal tell us that the dickeylincoin dams will provide needed growth in generating capacity. they claim that. because it is a public project. electricity can be provided at cheaper rates than those we currently pay. proponents also say the dams would control -the annual spring flooding of the st. john river and that the construction would provide employment for the region. these goals are excellent. if they could be met at a reasonable cost. by the construction of this massive project. it would be foolish to delay appropriations any longer. unfortunately. careful study shows the dickeylincoln hydroelectric project simply can accomplish these goals. in an enlightening article in the sierra club bulletin. october 1975. stephen whitney and paul swatek punctuate the inflated hopes for this project. their article is well researched and extremely valuable in any discussion of this project. regarding the question of power generating capacity. whitney and swatek affirm that of the 830 mekawatts capacity. 105 would go to maine and 725 would be transported to greater boston. in maine the electricity would go to preferred customersfederal installations and municipal utilitiesrather than to household consumers. the electricity to be transported to boston is for use during the daily 6hour period of peak use. but dickeylincoln can only provide 21/2 hours of peaking power. overall. so the contribution to bostons needs is small. the projected costs of dickeylincoln are astounding and the 1974 costsbenefits study prepared by the army corps of engineers does  even include inflationary increases in materials or labor.  does it provide for the profit margin of the construction firms that would build the dams. a study conducted with such lapses of any sense of reality must be viewed most skeptically. the promise of jobs is even more ephemeral. in maine. for example. winters create severe unemployment in all major industries. and the dam construction would fall victim to the same seasonal delays. instead of solving maines winter unemployment problems. construction would  begin until 1978 and significant number of jobs would be available before 1981. the jobs would. of course. be temporary. and many of the jobs are highly technical and will probably be filled by residents of other regions. the final promise of flood control for the st. john flood plain would  be feasible for at least a decade if at all. whitney and swatek offer some energysaving alternatives to the dickeylincoln project. their suggestions include improving the existing rail systems. providing wastewater treatment plants. promoting solidwaste recycling centers. and subsidizing the costs of home insulation and storm windows. these programs would produce more long term jobs. better pollution control. and more efficient energy use than dickeylincoln. i ask unanimous consent that this article i have referred to be printed in the record.
