 on the other side of the aisle that the ecoic opportunity act of 1964. the war on poverty. was passed with bipartisan support226 to 185. indeed. i am  sure that the program could have been passed without the support of 22 members on this side of the aisle who believed in its fundamental principles. this is  to say that many of us on this side of the aisle do  have some criticisms. that we may still offer some serious amendments. and i expect that we will. but let it be said before this house that some of us on this side of the aisle will join in bipartisan support of a program which we think is basic to the future of this country. to school dropout problems. to the young men and women of this country. and which will help many to break out of a hopeless cycle of poverty and despair and the lack of opportunity. second. . let me say that i am sure comments could be made with regard to both the majority and the miity report. and that the committee could have benefited from somewhat longer hearings.
