. i call to the attention of the senate that opening today in new york is the fifth annual u.s. world fair. which last night had its ambassadors dinner. and today. at 10:15 a.m.. was opened by the gover of the state of new york and the mayor of the city of new york. i. myself. would have been there. as i was on the program. had it  been for the imminent consideration of the conference report on the minimum wage bill here on the floor of the senate. the expansion of foreign trade and its maximation is probably one of the major problems facing our country. so. too. the issue incident to the extension of the reciprocal trade agreements act may well prove to be the most important ecoic issue before the public in the year 1962. new york is very proud of the world trade fair. which brings to our city the goods of many nations throughout the world. enabling visitors from those countries to this country. as well as the people of this nation. to see those goods displayed. they being an attraction to american buyers. as well as sellers. at the same time it spurs our imagination and shows what it means to live in an open world. in which trade is  used as a technique for government penetration. as it is among the communists. so i hope that as many of our colleagues as possible will visit new yorks fifth u.s. world trade fair. they will be more than welcome there. i k. i hope very much the country may k the significant contribution to our ecoy and also our social order which is made by the fair.
