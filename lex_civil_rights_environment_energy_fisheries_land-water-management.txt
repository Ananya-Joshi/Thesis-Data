 has also. taken administrative steps for improving refuge management with an executive order issued in march 1996. earlier this year. after a month of negotiations among a broad range of stakeholders. the house passed h.r. 1420. which was then referred to the senate. after discussions here in the senate. we have this amendment that makes narrow but important changes to h.r. 1420. and that clarifies the intent expressed by the house in the report of the committee on resources and in deliberation on the floor. the first two provisions of the amendment were changes included in s. 1059. this amendment clarifies that compatible uses can be both wildlifedependent and other uses. the allowance of compatible uses has become the cornerstone of the refuge system. balancing the needs of the fish. wildlife. and plants for which the refuge was established. with our own ability to use and enjoy the refuge for a wide range of activities. two points should be emphasized. however. first. while this legislation establishes that wildlifedependent recreational uses are to be given priority. any use may be authorized by the refuge manager provided that it is compatible with both the mission of the system and the purpose of the refuge. these are two separate principles contained in the bill. second. that all uses are required to be compatible in order to be allowed does  mean that all compatible uses are required to be allowed. the longstanding policy of the fish and wildlife service that a refuge is "closed until open" is  altered by this legislation. although wildlifedependent uses may be approved on an interim basis pending completion of the conservation plan for any land added to the system after march 25. 1996. the amendment requires that the secretary provide for monitoring of the status and trends of fish. wildlife. and plants on refuges. while this provision seems somewhat obvious. monitoring is often one of the first casualties of budgetary constraints. in addition. given some of the past problems with secondary uses on refuges. monitoring will be very important in measuring the success of the recent administrative and legislative changes that we are  undertaking. lastly.-monitoring will ensure that our scientific kledge regarding wildlife and natural resources continues to grow. the amendment clarifies the legislative intent regarding the periodic reevaluation on longterm secondary uses. such as electric utility rightsofway. the bill requires that wildife dependent uses be reevaluated less than every 10 years. some rightsofway are authorized for longer periods of time. and concern has been expressed that this reevaluation. together with the requirement that incompatible uses be eliminated or modified. may threaten the very existence of the rightsofway. for uses that are authorized for periods of longer than 10 years. this amendment limits the review to compliance with the terms and conditions under which the authorization is made. and  to the authorization itself. numerous individuals in both the senate and the house. as well as in the -administration. deserve praise for their persevering efforts over the years in seeking to improve the refuge system. and for their involvement on this bill. on the senate side. i would like to thank senators kempthorne and graham for their support on this amendment. i would also like to thank senators murkowski and allard for their understanding on issues relating to rightsofway and water rights on which they have expressed concern. with this amendment. i urge my colleagues to vote in support of h.r. 1420.
