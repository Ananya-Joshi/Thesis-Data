. in recent weeks. i am happy to report. there has been a iceable upturn in my mail in support of prompt enactment of the civil rights bill. i have heard from groups representing all the major religious faiths and from a wide variety of lay organizations. one such expression of support recently came from the diocesan convention of the episcopal diocese of newark. and i ask unanimous consent to insert it in the record.
