. i requested this time to confirm my understanding of the situation in regard to the gypsy moth control. as the subcommittee well ks. that has been a very seririous situation in new england. and particularly in massachusetts. spreading. as i understand it. into parts of southeastern new york. thern new jersey. and eastern pennsylvania. as a result of a meeting between officials of the department of agriculture and of all interested states. including representatives of state agricultural and conservation departments. held there on march 5.my impression is. it was generally recognized that if the infestation is  controlled. it could cause very extensive damage to timber and recreational facilities and to fruit. shade. and ornamental trees everywhere east of the mississippi river. my understanding is that the bill as reported by the committee for fiscal 1957 represents an increase of $1.750.000. or a total of $2.295.000. i further understand that within a year or so a technique has been developed of using a spray. i think composed of ddt and oil. which completely eliminates the insect where the area is sprayed and that an excellent cooperative program has been established between the department. the states. and the local governments. and also private individuals and organizations.
