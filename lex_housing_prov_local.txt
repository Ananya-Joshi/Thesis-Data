. may i first commend the distinguished senators classmate. the mayor of wilmington for the original concept which the senator so generously and modestly attributes to him. and then commend my colleague from delaware for introducing this amendment in the committee and making it a part of this omnibus housing bill. and i thank the senator from new york for presenting this amendment to the bill. because i think many more persons will be benefited  with the expansion to two. three. and four family dwellings. and i am very pleased and proud to have been a cosponsor of the amendment.
what the amendment seeks to do is to hold some clearance projects strictly to residential purposes. without allowing for any other purposes. with a broad distinction as to possibly incidental residential uses. whatever that means. yet this is often  the way that slum clearance can be actually effected and the kind of land use attained which will really permit slum clearance to deal with the housing problems which it is intended to reach.
