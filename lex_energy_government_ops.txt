. i request that an article which appeared in the international construction newsletter of july 1982. concerning hearings before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications. consumer protection. and finance on the foreign corrupt practices act. be inserted in the record following my statement.
this particular paragraph was of great interest to the new york state atomic and research development authority. based upon its inclusion as a part of the legislative history. i have withdrawn an objection to consideration of the bill. may i point out that in the statement which the senator made. perhaps inadvertently. he used the words "atomic power" instead of "atomic energy" at the end of the sentence reading: the commission. in requesting this amendment. asserted that it  has the authority. under the atomic energy act of 1954. to dispose of government property for use by the transferees for purposes related to the development and utilization of atomic energy.
