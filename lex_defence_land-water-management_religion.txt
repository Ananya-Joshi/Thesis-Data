and also that the peoples who seek freedom and are  communist captives may be encouraged by the buildup of our military strength and the ecoic strength of the free world and its moral strength. may i. as a special memorial to these workers who fought against the communists in east berlin on june 17. 1953. call the attention of the house to the barbaric outrage. of the kidnappings from west berlin by the soviet communist regime in east berlin. may i call your attention for example to the barbaric character of the kidnaping by the soviet regime in east berlin verified by our state department of dr. frushich. a stateless person of slovene origin who came to berlin in 1950 with american assistance and established a relief organization for russian orthodox refugees to provide assistance to the refugees from communism and who was kidnapped out of west berlin by the soviet agents on april 13. 1954.  how immoral and how uncivilized and how barbaric can a red regime be and this shows just how barbaric it can be. it shows what we are fighting against in the soviet communist idea. i hope. as we debate policy here. we realize that only the united strength. fully integrated of the whole free world and its aroused moral strength will win this struggle which we k we can win with the sentiment demonstrated by these east berlin workers who defied the red army behind the iron curtain.
