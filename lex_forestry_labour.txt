. i am pleased. to join my finance committee colleagues in introducing a bill to extend and reform the trade adjustment assistance program (taa] that is scheduled to expire on september 30 of this year. this legislation will enable workers displaced by imports to retrain and gain new skills. in the past taa provided temporary assistance to displaced workers. this revised bill will continue to provide assistance. however. there is additional focus on the importance of a completed retraining program. it will give people a handup instead of a handout. congress is well aware of the sertousness of the trade imbalance and the impact that it has had on the workers in many u.s. - industries. across the country. peoples livelihoods are at stake. in idaho this week. potlatch corp. closed several timber processing plants which resulted in a layoff of onethird of its idaho work force. clearly. the flood of canadian timber across the border has cut deeply into the u.s. timber industrys market. the tragedy of the situation is that these facilities may  reopen these mills in idaho. those people may have to find new jobs and learn new skills. this bill will continue to irovide workers displaced by imports with all benefits  available under taa. however. a new eligibility requirement stipulates that any worker receiving benefits under the new program must be enrolled in or have completed a retraining program. this requirement further emphasizes the need for adjustment and retraining. this revised taa program. with an expanded worker retraining portion. is a vital step toward restoring the industrial strength. of this country. i am pleased it has the support of so many of my finance committee colleagues.e

. although this bill does redhce the appropriation for the dislocated worker assistance program. this decrease is  reflective of the programs operating level. which is expected to remain constant nationally between program years 1985 and 1986 due to the availability of carryover. in those individual states in which sufficient carryover is  available to maintain ongoing levels. i expect the secretary of labor to use his discretionary resources to prevent serious program disruptions. in addition. the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. and education will monitor the level of carryover funding as the program enters program year finally. the subcommittee appreciates the special problems posed by the forest products industry in the pacific thwest. in the report accompanying this appropriations bill. we have urged the secretary of labor to give special attention to programs that aid dislocated workers in the wood products industry in the pacific thwest.
