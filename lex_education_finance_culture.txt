i have just ascertained. by taking a "reading" from my colleague. the senator from new york . that boxing was held to be a. business under the antitrust laws. therefore. as the senator from kansas has said. it is necessary to rationalize the applicability of our laws and policy to the various ports. i welcome that. i am glad to hear that we are  far apart. the only point which occurred to meand i reiterate it only for the purpose of emphasisis that this is the kind of situation which must be evaluated in terms of the public interest and on its merits. especially following a basic maxim in american life. namely. that the growth of our country has always been attributable to stronger. more effective entities. rather than tearing something down in order to equalize the situation. so the policy i would hope would be followed would be to add elements of strength to those who may be lagging behind. rather than to cut down the strength of those who may be forging ahead. and  to assume. merely because it is cbs and the new york yankees that are involved. that therefore this proposal is something which congress should  permit. i am delighted to learn from the distinguished senator from kansas the specific fact that he does  think so. either. i hope that we may join in exploring what ought to be done in the light. first. of the public interest. and second. of the greater strength and capability for performance for the american people of the sport of baseball and other sports.
