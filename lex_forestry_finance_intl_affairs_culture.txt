finally. i think it is a rather good thing to air these matters completely. and i think it is very wise and necessary. in the interest of our country. to air them on the affirmative side. as well. who is this man zellerbach. and why was he appointed to be ambassador to italy. it was  merely because he was an agreeable personality. but because he has talents and abilities which are necessary and useful in the interest of our country. first. he is. and has been for a very long time. the president of one of the outstandingly successful corporations in our country. the crownzellerbach corp.. the second largest paper company in the world. that corporation is successful  because it has made a great deal of money. but because it is literally an ornament of industry on the pacific coast. because it has the most outstanding labormanagement relations in that part of the world. it is credited with great developments in forest lands and urban areas in that part of the united states. because it is a business which operates in the public interest. secondand very importanthere is a man who takes his civic responsibility very seriously. the reason why he became involved in the controversy over the murals was that he is probably the leading citizen of san francisco in terms of art and music. which are so important. it is interesting to e that in connection with that particular controversy the house subcommittee. which held hearings on the resolution to which the senator from wisconsin referred. did  even report the resolution to the full committee. so  of the committee for ecoic development. a very important ecoic organization in our country. last june he was named the business statesman of the year for 1956 by the national sales executives. that is hardly a communist organization.
