. i am always pleased to learn of positive efforts in federalstatelocal cooperation. i invite attention to the impressive cooperative effort between new york state and the federal government in developing regional resource development boards to bring various agencies together to study the very important problem of soil and water conservation. in particular. i am speaking of the new york state river basin studies which may prove to be the catalyst for construction of reservoirs for flood control. municipal water supply. pollution control. irrigation. and recreation. as well as for the identification of areas best suited for agriculture. highways. and parks. i am particularly concerned with the need to minimize water pollution problems in smaller rivers and streams during periods of drought as well as the need for construction of reserve water facilities in rural areas in anticipation of future industrial and community growth needs. together with 10 new york members of congress. i have introduced a bill. s. 2308. to deal with these two problems in particular. i am hopeful that the proposed legislation will be enacted so that additional federal assistance will be available to new york state and other states to implement plans such as that which may be submitted by the western new york state river basin study. i ask unanimous consent that an article entitled "new york plan for water." written by the assistant commissioner of the new york state conservation department. francis w. montanari. and wallace l. anderson. the state conservationist. and published in the department of agriculture publication "soil conservation." be printed in the record. the article discusses in some detail the splendid efforts being made in new york.
