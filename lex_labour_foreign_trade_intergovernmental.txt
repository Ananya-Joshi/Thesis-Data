i am  abandoning anything. i am laying the fact before the senate and am trying to decide whether or how i should modify my amendment. i shall give the basis for my view. there is a great question about the wisdom. let alone the effectiveness. of the interest equalization tax. for example. it is  inhibiting overseas private investment. in overseas private investment. we receive much and give much. while private longterm u.s. capital outflows totaled $4.4 billion in 1964. our income from overseas private investment totaled $5 billion. to the extent we inhibit private investment overseas we also reduce future earnings from total investment. we also reduce u.s. exports connected with such investment. there is a real possibility that the toe may have contributed to the leveling off -of our exports since mid1964. next. the -reduction in the straight kind of underwriting which this proposal was designed to afford had like effect. there was about $1 billion worth of underwriting going on in 1964 and it continued at that rate in the first quarter of 1965. so we can continue in this manner indefinitely. it will cost us more than we will get out of it. in terms of private investment. therefore. i thought of providing some flexibility. because our balanceofpayments financial situation can change in a week. our balance of payments has changed in 6 weeks from a bad situation to what at the moment looks like a better situation.
