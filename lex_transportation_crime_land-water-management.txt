as i understand the issue. the rates charged by the company are  involved in the particular matter i am speaking of. the company is taking power from the dam and delivering power at. the other end of its system. the only question is whether the company delivers the same power. after proper allowance i3 made for any loss en route. as the senator points out. there is  a yardstick of rates established by the government because there is one company already serving the whole area. and the justice of the rates depends on the stability of tha railroad commission of california in fixing them. i may say that i have  heard a criticism of the rates as such or the work of the commission as such.
