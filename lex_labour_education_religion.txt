 has proposed rescihding 25 percent of the funds that congress has already apportioned under 94142 for the school year which starts this fall. as i said earlier. next yearthe first year of the block grantsthe administration has proposed a 25 percent reduction for education programs. but i think we have some grounds for hope here. the senate committee on labor and human resources rejected the proposed cuts for 94142 grants and instead recommended a 10 percent increase above the current level. that recommendation would increase 94142 grant funding from $922 million to slightly over $1 billion. the senate budget committee. however. rejected the 10 percent increase for the next year but did maintain the current funding level despite the administrations request for a 25 percent cut. over the past several yearslargely through the trailblazing of organizations like christ church child center and the leadership of the professionals in special educationvirtually every school district in the nation has moved toward affirming the fundamental rights of handicapped children. this is a substantial achievement especially when you consider that when i was a boy growing up in frederick. marlylanjl. families with handicapped children literally locked them away. hid them from public view. so we can be proud of what we have achieved. but we still have a very long way to go and . just when were beginning to see real signs of progress both in attitudes toward the handicapped and in education for handicapped children. is time to turn back. if. new limits on federal spending must curtail or slow down delivery of some federal services. we must redouble our efforts to fulfill the roal of 94412: "to assure the free appropriate public education of all handicapped children." i can think of more appropriate way for all of us to mark this 20th anniversary of the christ church child center than by reaffirming our shared commitment to americas handicapped children..
