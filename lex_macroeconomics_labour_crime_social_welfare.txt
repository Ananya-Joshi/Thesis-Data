i thank my colleague very much. i would like to give some of the facts. because the facts are critically important. again. with respect to the emous estimate of $20 billion. or something like that. based on the may 1973 submissions. according to the best estimates we have. the states estimate that $2.162 billion will be required for this year in the federal financing of the services here under consideration. my own state of new york. which has probably the biggest welfare problem in the country according to its expenditures. spent at the rate of $442 million per annum based upon the record. let us remember. also. which is critin cally important. that this figure of $442 million means the state spent $110 million. and also let us remember that the figure of $442 million excludes child care and family planning which. even under the finance committees idea. would be retained. for all those reasons. i feel that that is  the wise thing to do from. the point of view of the national interest. and i believe. the amendment of the senator from florida should be agreed to. we will undoubtedly act in this matter. i have doubt of it whatever. i am sure state has any doubt about it. but we should  act improvidently. we should endeavor to deal with it with a scalpel. and  with a cutlass. in a matter that is as sensitive as this one. in view of the financial condition of the states. i believe that kind of legislation will come before us and that we will act on it. the provision which senator chiles seeks to strike is  in the national or state interest. at the very moment. we are giving some help. which in fact they need. on revenue sharing. we are going to rob them of almost half of what we have provided. so. if we really want to help them. we should strike this provision from the bill.
