. senator williamis and i are introducing a bill to amend section 4942(g) (2) of the internal revenue code. the socalled setaside provision under which amounts set aside by private foundations for future payment may be treated as qualifying distributions under the tax reform act of 1969. the robert wood johnson foundation. one of the nations largest foundations. has encountered a severe problem owing to the internal revenue services administration of section 4942 and specifically 4942(g) of the code. these sections were added by the tax reform act of 1969. section 4942 requires that a foundation pay out either all of its investment income or a statutorily determined percentage6 percent in 1975of its asset value. or be subject to a penalty tax. at issue is the ability of the foundations to use the setaside method of grantmaking described in section 4942 (g) to meet the payout requirement of section 4942. when a foundation makes a grant. one method of funding. of course. is by awarding the entire amount of the grant at the beginning of the project. in many cases. however. this is  the most desirable approach. some projects:=-by their very complexity. require regular monitoring and frequent evaluation. in these cases. foundations often prefer the setaside approach. that is. setting funds aside for annual payments over the term of the grant. that is. 5 years. rather than by actual total payout at the inception of the grant period. under section 4942(g). in order for funds granted but set aside for future payout to be treated as qualifying distributions in the year of the award. the internal revenue service must affirm that the purpose of the grant can be better accomplished by the setaside method rather than by immediate payment of the full amount. this involves a separate determination by the service. for each grant. that is  only a programatic. judgmental decision. rather than a factual test. but is also a cumbersome and timeconsuming process. the problem that this poses for the robert wood johnson foundation is unique. because of the foundations substantial increase in assets on the death of robert wood johnson in 1968. while other major foundations had numerous major funding commitments made in previous years. the robert wood johnson foundation had similar commitments. backlog of prior approved grants. this meant that in order to meet the payout requirements of section 4942. the foundation had to secure affirmative irs approval of its setaside grants every year. the bill we are introducing permits foundations to set aside for subsequent grants sums that might otherwise be required to be paid out immediately in order to avoid the penalty tax. further. our bill will  mean any revenue loss to the treasury. the bill will merely relieve the treasury of the responsibility of passing on the merits of each setaside. our bill is consistent with legislative intent as expressed in the 1969 act. since congress at that time both imposed the payment requirement and provided for the setaside method of meeting it. what was unforeseen in 1969 was that a new foundation. or one whose assets were suddenly multiplied many times oversuch as the robert wood johnson foundationwould find it impossible to meet the requirement initially while using the setaside methods. unless each setaside grant was specifically approved by the treasury. our bill. then. will make possible the orderly growth and management of philanthropy by new and greatly enlarged foundations. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
. i point out that those of us who are fighting for a civil rights bill at this session are  talking against the wind. we are talking about a reality. and the biggest thing uppermost in respect of reform in the south is reform of voting procedures so that more people will have the right to vote. these figures indicate that we are faced with a great deal of nullification and relatively little progress. i believe that shows why congress should amend the act. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point in my remarks an article entitled "negro registration is set back in south." written by claude sitton. and published in the new york times of sunday. august 30. 5.305 44. 122 8.905 7.71 1.326 2. 278 2.695 4.737 6.071 7.468 7.893 2.618 5. 782 4.$0 22. 329 2.123 5.150 6.149 3.126 9.886 3. 824 7.958 4.387 6.643 4. 504 3. 556 p residio -----------------------r ains 2....................... randall ..................... reagaln real --------------------------red r iver -------------------reeves 1 2 ...................... refugio 1 2 .................. roberts ....................... robertson --------------------rockwall 3 -------------------runnels ....................... rusk-. .................. sabine ----------------........ san augustine ................. san jacinto 3 ................... san patricio ................... san saba ...................... schleicher - 2................... scurry 1 2 -------- ..-----shackelford.- --............... shelby 3 ----------------------sherman ...................... sm ith 2....................... somervell - -------------------starr ......................... stephens --------------------sterling - --................... stonewall 2 ................ sutton -------------------------swisher ........................ tarrant 2 ....................... taylor 1 2 ....................... terrell ........................ t erry 1 2 ------..--------........ throckmorton ................. t i t u s - - - - - - ---- - - - - - - - - - - - - - tom green 2 .................. travis ......................... trinity ........................ tyler ...................... upshur a ...................... u pton --------------------uvalde .................. val verde 2 .................... van zandt 8 .................... victoria 2 ....................... w alker ------------..------..... waller 3--............. ward ------ ..------------------w ashington 3 ................. webb 2 .................... -w harton 2 .- ---------------wheeler ....................... wichita 2 ------------------..... wilbarger 2 ................... willacy .................. williamson .................... wilson ........................ winkler ----------------------wise .......................... wood -------.---------------yoakum ----------------------young ........................ zapata ..... ---.................. zaval - ------------------total ---------------2. 093 2.000 4. 0 3.919 1.100 163. 773 8.054 54.291 .226. 818 negro poplation. 1950 42t 5.230 1.120 8.212 1. 68 12. 632 2.240 3.0568 3.767 go 5.916 22.291 39.674 2.561 3.197 3.091 22.493 2.688 2.232 6.009 1. 543 3.073 7.494 6.328 6.903 7.843 "288 6.276 1.746 6. 864 3. 124 977. 458 4 includes both "poll taxes paid" and "listed exempts." source: sro consultantpopulation figures: 1950 census.
