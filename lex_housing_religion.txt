. at the recent dedication of a new housing development in new york city. his eminence francis cardinal spellman delivered an address which should. in my view. be brought to the attention of my colleagues. the cardinals statement is particularly able because it emphasizes the positive aspect of what is happening in our nation today in the drive for equal rights for all. while in way denying how much is left to be done. cardinal spellman quite properly specifies exactly how integration actually works in new york in particular situations. his statement is also valuable because it stresses the important role which the church plays in this most vital movement toward making our constitutional guarantees a reality. i ask unanimous consent that his address be printed in the record at this point in my remarks.
