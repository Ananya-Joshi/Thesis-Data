. i would hope very much. since we k that the yarborough amendment is coming along. which will further assure the impacted area people that they are  going to suffer by virtue of some element of equalization with the public housing children. that the senate will see fit to reject the amendment of the senator from colorado.
i should like to ask senator brooke to reply to this. this equalization amendment in respect of community development recognizes a new formula which. for large cities. we thoroughly approve and support. but we understand that in the reallocation. if there is an ascending scale of benefit to these cities. they lose that ascending scale in the reallocation plan. and it is  generally and wisely distributed to all urban counties. but only hits these major cities. what is there. in explanation of this amendment. which bears upon that question. . i am sympathetic to the senators plight.
