i assure my distinguished colleague from wyoming that he will be given ample time to express his views. however. we were able to get the language of hyde amended to permit federal funding for abortions where the life of the mother would be endangered if she carried the fetus to term. further. i was pleased that the conferees accepted my conference report language which makes additional exceptions to the effect of the hyde amendment. in my september 17 floor statement i spelled out how hew should interpret both the bill and the conference report language. particularly during the interim period between the effective date of this bill. should it become law. and the rendering of a supreme court decision on the hyde amendment. it is vital that hew understand the intent of the conference action on the hyde amendment so that it does . in the interim period. administer the abortion language to the detriment of those. who would be most directly affected. i urge hew to read carefully my september 17 floor statement for guidance on this important matter. with the battle over hyde behind us. at least for the moment. it  is important that we move ahead and enact the laborhew bill with its important funds for badly needed social programs. the bill as it presently stands totals $56.6 billion. it is $3.9 billion over what must be called the low and unrealistic budget requests submitted to congress in january.
