if i might respond to the distinguished majority leader. he states the sequence of events totally accurately. i had occasion to read ing. and more specifically the comments of the distinguished senator from th carolina. where. on the floor last night. he said the time had come to vote on senate joint resolution 73. i contemplated that. and felt. indeed. we had spent egh time. there is reason why we should  vote on senate joint resolution 73. specifically. that was my proposal to the majority leader this morning. he added the provisions of the committee amendment. to which i have objection and suggested that we do it this week. i have objection to that. i would hope that my colleagues would follow the lead of both the majority leader and the miity leader. we can fashion something that gets us to voting. i knew that. like any gordian k. like any complex problem. we can resolve it all at once. my feeling wasand i am sure this is also in the back of the mind of the distinguished senator from th carolinalet us just take the first step and see where we can go from there. i can s4y any more than that. i did  discuss with the majority leader equal access of amendments. silent prayer amendments. and on down the long list that is here. i did  even get into that. i said. let us just take this first step. that i all. either in terms of the letter of what we discussed or the spirit of what we discussed. that was accomplished in the course of these negotiations. i am the first to say that if everybody is going to try to piggyback on senate joint resolution 73. we are right back where we started. that just is  going to happen. it is very difficult for those of us who are on the side of the argument presented by senator danrorth. myself. and others. to deal with this myriad of proposals that we have. it is  the most orderly process. to begin with. but there is point in complaining about it. that is the situation. what we can do is address ourselves to the matter that has been on the desk  for 10 days. and then let the chips fall where they may. i have asked for other concessions. the majority leader has asked for hing except the vote on this amendment. i would hope thatspecifically we are contemplating thursday. sometime in the middle of the afternmy colleagues would allow us to get to that point. then. having untied that small piece of the gordian k. let us see what is left. and we can all go ahead and divide up on that. maybe we will be getting together again down the road on what needs to be done next. but the majority leader. i think. has been very patient. as i said at the outset. there have been filibusters. i certainly hope this is an indication of the good faith of those on my side to go to a vote and that everyone who has an amendment at least allow this matter to proceed apace and  try to come into a comprehensive solution. that can never happen. i assure my colleagues on the floor as to that. i said this matter could very well be on the principal effort of the president of the united states. and as amended by the committee amendment. that we can have a vote. if we all agree. on thursday of this week.
