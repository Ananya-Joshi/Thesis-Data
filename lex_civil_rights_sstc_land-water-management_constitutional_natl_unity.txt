. this arrangement will last for a maximum of 3 years. may be terminated at any time by a vote of the legislative assembly. and is designed to provide continuity during the transition period. the new government inherits from the nlc a stable political climate. the constitution created under its supervision provides for a popularly elected government and insures the fundamental freedoms. among these life. liberty. and security of the individual. freedom of conscience. freedom of expression. freedom of assembly and association. in addition the nlc. during its 3year tenure. was able to salvage the ecoy of ghana and to lay sound foundations for the further improvement and expansion of trade and ecoic development. the new prime minister of ghana. dr. k. a. busia. in a nationwide broadcast in ghana. appealed to all his fellow ghanaians to start the second republic in the spirit of forgiveness and tolerance. he said: this time. we shall succeed in building a truly democratic country in which we shall be proud and happy to live. the second republic of ghana has thus been born. the young and virile people of this country are determined to succeed. in the same way that ghana. in 1957. blazed the trail that has since ushered the majority of african countries into independent nationhood. so once again the precedent ghana has set in orderly transition to civilian administration may well pave the way and provide the lead for similar political achievements throughout all of africa. in their determination to develop lasting democratic institutions. the people of ghana deserve our good will. our understanding. and our support. today. when their new civilian government is duly sworn in. i extend to them my deepest commendation and best wishes.
