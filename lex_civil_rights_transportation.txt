. i support the lautenberg amendment. and people say this is a states rights issue. i would remind everyone that medicaid. a federal program. pays for probably the great majority of the injuries that arise from excessive speed and terrible accidents. so i hope that we will go forward with the speed limit as suggested by the senator from new jersey.
. i would like to speak today on a matter of grave concern to all americans: the oppression of the captive peoples of the world. freedom must never be taken for granted. the millions who do  share our rights must ever be a sign of the long road that lies ahead of us. the road to freedom and opportunity for all people. many who daily yearn for a democratic and free society are denied its blessings. in many of the nations of eastern europe freedomloving peoples are prevented from exercising the full rights to which they are entitled. these patient peoples must k that they are  alone in their plight. that our hearts are with them and our hopes are high for their eventual liberation. let us pray that the recent. hopeful signs of change in such countries as czechoslovakia will prove to be only the prelude to other. more farreaching attempts to move the nations of eastern europe away from totalitarianism and toward true selfdetermination. as we observe captive nations week. it is fitting that we reaffirm our commitment to the ideals of freedom and reinforce our will to help all men free themselves from political. ecoic. and social oppression.
 to annce. contemporaneously with the signing into law of the civil rights act of 1964. that the enjoyment in mississippi of rights of american citizens will be safeguarded with the full authority of the united states. citizens who travel from state to state for lawful purposes. such as these students who seek to educate negroes to exercise their constitutional right to vote. deserve the protection of the u.s. government.  should the government insist that death or serious injury befall them before it extends its protection. i e also that yesterday 29 professors of law in 6 universities expressed public disagreement with attorney general kennedys flat assertion that the federal government lacked the power to take effective action in mississippi. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the statement of the 29 law professors.
. each of them subject to the advice and consent of the senate. this gives them a certain durability and independence of the same type that we introduced. for example. with the general counsel for the nlrb. for exactly the same reason. we have given certain rights to this agency. with respect to the proceedings of other government agencies. which are quite unusual. it does  stand in those agencies as an applicant or a petitioner. it stands as of right. as an agency of government. with the express duty. as if it were a district attorney. to speak for the consumers interest. in my judgment. the balance would be seriously disturbed by adopting this amendment. which. it has been ed. would be unique. sui generis.  the case in any other agency. Â• i think we can easily throw this whole thing out of kilter the minute we start along that road and alienate the basic support we  have and a certain confidence in the fact that the bill is fairly balancedthat it is a new and untried concept which worries some people in this country. but is appealing to others in this country. i hope the senate will  allow this balance to be disturbed by this amendment. which would open that door and begin that process.
. i am joining once again with my colleagues. senators rricof1 and percy. in cosponsoring the consumer protection organization act of 1973. i am very pleased that senator marnuson. the distinguished chairman of the senate commerce committee. and senator moss. the distinguished chairman of the consumer subcommittee have joined us as original cosponsors of this important bill. their assistance will be of inestimable value as we consider the bill on the senate. when i first came to congress almost 25 years ago. "consumerism" as a national issue barely existed in the public mind. as our american ecoy grew more diverse and dynamic. there evolved a concern on the part of consumers and then a determination to get better products. better service. fairer interest rates. and credit terms. and a high standard of product safety. the consumer movement continued to grow and make itself visible and articulate because more and more families properly regarded consumerism as a pocketbook issueone which deals with their buying power and their right to a fair return for the hardearned dollars which they invest in the hundreds of thousands of new and more sophisticated products which annually flood the american market. we are all consumers. together we represent the largest ecoic interest in the country. collectively. there is a significant impact upon us by almost every public and private sector ecoic decision. twothirds of all spending in the ecoy is by consumers. nevertheless. american consumers are   sufficiently represented in the department. agencies where major decisions relating to consumers interests are made. in the bill being introduced today we have sought three general objectives in seeking to remedy the problems and legitmate grievances which our national revolution in marketing has created: first. the broader and more effective consideration of business practices as they relate to consumers. second. more effective penalties and remedies for violation of these regulations. and third. expanded consumer protection initiatives in various federal agencies and more aggressive advocacy of consumer interests. we have had some success in congress in recent years with passage of important consumer legislation. including the consumer credit protection act and the truthinpackaging law. on other fronts there have also been important advances. consumer protection offices and departments have been established in the white house and in many states and localities. including an excellent program under the attorney general of new york. also. of course. the private action of consumer groups and concerned citizens. particularly the organization of ralph nader. have had a major impact in helping to marshal support on the side of the consumer. i was profoundly disappointed that during the last session of congress the senate failed to pass the landmark consumer bill which we introduce todaythe consumer protection organization act. the keystone provision of the billthe creation of an independent consumer protection agencywas approved in the senate in the 91st congress by a margin of 74 to 4. the bill represents an effort by the federal government to organize better itself so that the consumers interestslike those of business. agriculture. labor and so forthare given due consideration throughout the governments regulatory network. it had as its primary objective the improvement of the governments consumer protection structure. too oftenfor one reason or the otherthe agencies and departments of government have failed to consider adequately. in the decisionmaking processes. the needs and concerns of the consumer or to insure that the consumers problemsvisavis the problems of other private interestswere given the attention they deserved. by providing certain structural changes. especially by the institutionalization of a consumer agency within the federal system. this bill will help the government to correct this serious deficiency. it will establish a consumer protection agencycpato advocate the consumer interests before all the other departments and agencies of government and in the federal courts. it will provide for grants to state and local governments and profit organizations to assist them with consumer protection programs and it will establish a threemember council of consumer advisers in the white house to help coordinate and reinforce the ongoing consumer efforts in the executive branch. the cpa will  be a superagency of government. as to its consumers role before other agencies. it will have procedural rights. and that is all. i appreciate that many in the business community and even some among the federal agencies are concerned that the cpa in its advocates role would disrupt the orderly processes of government and unduly interfere with legitimate business relationships. this is  the design. the intention. or the effect of this legislation. this bill is balanced and responsible legislation. it will offer the consumer a strong voice in his federal governments activities. i and other senators have worked for over 3 years to develop and improve this legislation. we hope to develop the case for this bill in joint hearings of the government operations and commerce committees. the important issues involved will once again come before the senate. the consumers central civil right is to get his moneys worth. he has many rights and many remedies in theory. but the best place to assert them is generically in the departments and agencies. our bill provides that the cpa will be headed by a bipartisan threemember commission and that the chairman of the commission will be the administrator of the agency. the commission is vested with the authorities and powers of the agency. but the administrator is charged with the full responsibility of carrying on the functions and daytoday operations. the cpa would  be the sole repository of king what is best for the consumer. it is  to be thought of by the people of the united states or the other agencies as the one and only consumer voice but it is to be charged with presenting and working for consumer positions before other agencies. it therefore is of paramount importance in my opinion that decisionmaking agencies in the federal establishment be ever vigilant of competing consumer interests. they must keep their doors open to other consumer groups. who must be encouraged to present their own views. and even to solicit their opinions. to vest in this new agency any less authority to intervene and participate before the other agencies than our bill providesthat is. to provide amicus standing onlywould be like giving someone a new car on the condition he is  allowed to buy gasthe car just will  go. there are approximately 50 federal agencies and bureaus performing some 200 or 300 functions affecting the consumer. by utilizing both the council and the cpa created in our bill. we would create a new means to police the departments and agencies to insure that they are doing their job for the american consumer. that assurance is long overdue for our people.
the only contemplation of that migration that i see is the concept of the incursion of a lot of plo riflemen into the west bank. the west bank has 500.000 people  and it is  a very big place. so there is probably  too much accommodation just to move in. as it were. to vacant territory. doubt there would be pressure to encroach on israeli territory. those are. as the senator has developed. a number of the reasons that motivated what i said about that issue. i do  wish to let it go without saying that for years i have worked and fought for the support of the palestinearab refugees in their resettlement. intelligent malization of their conditions. and for the rights of the arabs in israel as full 100percent citizens of that country. i have truck with any discrimination of any kind or character against them anywhere. including in israel. but that is a very different concept from the threat which the israelis feel pointed at their heart in a plo west bank state in the present rather crude state or relations between them and the arab confrontation states.
