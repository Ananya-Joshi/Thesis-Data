. i have examined. as has the distinguished chairman of the appropriations committee. the rmendment offered by our colleague from south carolina. actually. this amendment is much worse in its import than the language which ultimatelv was agreed upon by the senate and the house after 51/2 months of conference last year. some of the senators were  in the room when we had the debate on the previous amendment. i do  want to prolong the night. because i believe that this is the last amendment prior to final passage of this bill. i shall be brief. only to say that senator magnuson and i. and the members of the full appropriations committee. this year adopted almost the same abortion language which the senate agreed to last year prior to conference. thus. among other matters. the language which is contained in this bill provides for "medically necessary" abortions. this is basically the same language we took to conference with the house last year.
