madam president. i rise in opposition to both the amendments of the senator from washington. what we have here. it seems to me. is a proposal that there be a double standard for the members of congress. that is. those who are extremely wealthy can have unlimited amounts of outside unearned income derived from securities. rents. or whatever it might be. but under the proposal of the senator from washington--the first amendment that he proposesthose who serve in the senate or in congress would be limited to the pay currently being received in the house of representatives. about $69.000. plus 30 percent of that. this is an amendment that is fine for those who come to the senate as millionaires. but which penalizes those who have source of outside unearned income. madam president. we have debated ad nauseum in this chamber what is a suitable amount for our pay. if the amount that was being paid to senators in 1969 when it went to $42.500. were increased in accordance with the consumer price index. we would be earning about $118.000 today. well. such has obviously  taken place. madam president. our pay is much lower than that. but  we have a proposal that there be restrictions that ones hoaria be limited to 30 percent of the senate salary. i do  think that is fair. particularly in view. as i mentioned previously. of the large outside unearned incomes that are permitted to those who are wealthy egh to have them. let me just direct a few remarks. if i may. to the business of hoaria and what it does to people. somehow there is the implication that if you are out earning hoaria. how you are being bought. or in the alternative that you are  devoting adequate time and energy to your role as a u.s. senator. let me just give a couple of examples. two of the most productive members of this u.s. senate have been senator muski. who left here and went on to become secretary of state. and senator hubert humphrey. later vice president of the united states and then later a u.s. senator again. one would question the contribu. lions that those men made to the u.s. senate in originality. in work. in dedication. or in attention to their senate duty. but listen to these statistics. madam president: in 1969. senator muskie earned in hoaria $80.000$80.000 in 1969 dollars. that would translate. in todays dollars. to $232.000. one said he was  paying attention to his duties. what about senator humphrey. in 1971 he made $83.000. that would translate in todays dollars to about $236.000. well. there is ody in this chamber who comes even close to that in hoaria earnings. $236.000 for one. $232.000 for the other. each of them among the most productive members of this u.s. senate. whose integrity was beyond question. whose contribution to this body. to the laws of the land. to the welfare of the united states goes unchallenged. . madam president. i would like to ask the sponsors of this amendment whether there ar going to be backtoback votes. or depending on the outcome of the first proposal. will the second be offered as a fallback position.
