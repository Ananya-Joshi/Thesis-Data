. the question is. "who won the war. daddy. i mean the second world war." the answer is that. while the united states was on the winning side. our state department and our treasury department have just made it clear how to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. there is doubt that we have a balanceofpayments problem. one way to continue that problem is to continue our approximately 350.000 troops in europe. as senator mansfield has pointed 24. 1967. at page 4437. united states support of our military forces in western europe.  comprising between five and six divisions. costs approximately $2/2 billion a year. and about $1 billion of that ends up as a dollar deficit and eventually a further drain upon our gold reserves.  come our state and treasury departments with the most absurd solution to this problem by having the german bundesbank purchase and hold mediumterm u.s. bonds to cover the foreign exchange outflow. so we have come full circle. we won the war and our defeated enemy buys our bonds to help support us. we borrow money from germany so we can keep our troops in europe. what kind of victory. if the defeated enemy becomes our international banker. alice in wonderland would have had a perfect setting in our state and treasury departments.
