first. the amendment on methyl chloroform that was adopted on january 31 by a vote of 95 to 2 is included in this substitute. a conforming amendment to the trade sanctions portion of the bill is also included. second. an amendment is included to clarify the authority of the administrator to allow limited production of cfcs and other regulated substances for export to developing countries in accordance with the montreal protocol. third. a threepart amendment is added to restore language currently found in section 157 of the clean air act regarding the authority and responsibility of the administrator to promulgate regulations. this amendment simply moves a portion of the existing law from one place to aher. in a similar fashion. it moves that part of the existing law concerning international cooperation to the new title 5. it also adds new authority for the administrator to foster international participation in the montreal protocol by. at the discretion of the administrator and the secretary of state. contributing funds to help developing countries comply with the protocol. the amendment authorizes  more than $75 million annually for such assistance and makes these funds subject to the appropriations process. finally. there has been a fair amount of discussion in this chamber about the need to regulate the socalled hcfcs. these are a class of ozone destroying chemicals that are less potent than cfcs but remain dangerous in their own right. in place of the amendment i had prepared that would have forced the elimination of these chemicals by the year 2030. this substitute clarifies epas authority and responsibility to regulate hcfcs and directs epa to submit a report to congress by january 1995. the report is to examine the feasibility of implementing a control program similar to the one i had originally proposed. . of those who were extremely helpful with this legislation. i failed to mention the distinguished junior senator from louisiana. who has such an important role and was so helpful. and who has been a supporter of this legislation. it is my understanding he is going to support it throughout the remainder of the efforts we have on the floor. i thank the chair.
madam president. i can think of a more inappropriate day for this legislation to be brought forth. last evening. a dinner was given at the white house for the prime minister of poland. today at lunch. our two leaders from the majority side and the miity side gave a luncheon for the prime minister of poland. at which the distinguished presiding officer was present. as were others. what we are saying with this amendment is. welcome. free poland. we are delighted you have attained your freedom and democracy has been achieved there. just like we are thrilled with what has taken place in czechoslovakia. but at the same time. you poles who are striving to get your country together. we recognize you have the dirtiest polluted section of the world. so we are  going to let you send your goods here. we are. going to slap a tariff on these goods because we are spending money to clean up. you poles over there. you are just striving to get your act together. and you have  been able to put on these scrubbers. air pollutant control devices. and you will  be for a long time. i wonder how many read the article in yesterdays new york times about krakow. poland. the place is a disas-. ter area from toxic air pollutants and other pollutants. and it will  be able to be cleaned up. why. because the poles just can afford the equipment. they are scrambling out of the middle ages industrially. they have been occupied for 40 years and with the heavy hand of the soviets. as have the czechs. as have the hungarians. as have the baltic regions. as have the romanians. each of those. countries. we applaud what :they achieved.  we are turning around with this amendment. "we cleaned up. you have :. do  send your goods here. do  try to compete with us. we are slapping a tariff on them." i k the distinguished senator from illis has a lot of polish constituents. i would be curious of his reaction to what he is proposing here. is this really what he wants to do. is this really what he is doing to the country that so many of his citizens have come from and look back with pride and are trying to help out and realizing that the first thing they could do is  to clean up their air and control these emissions. look at this wealthy country of ours. look how long it has taken .s we have  had a clean air act in 13 years. and we are struggling to get this one passed. how long have we been on it. we have been on it since january. 23 to february. to march. 2 months. and we are  through yet. i have a daughterinlaw that is expecting a baby in september. i want this act to be through before that baby arrives. and i think it is going to be a close call the way we are proceeding around here. Â• madam president. that just gives a little indication of what these proponents of this legislation are. talking about. these countries are struggling. they think it is a bashthejapanese program. look. the japanese are getting their air pollutant control devices. if you think you are going to punish the japanese with this. i think you better think it over a little more. they are doing a good job. in many areas .they are way ahead of us. certainly in solid waste control. that is point. one. point two. i think it is clearly a violation of gatt. and that has been taken up by those who have spoken before me. point three. where do you draw the line. you say clean air legislation. well. as you k. we have osha. occupational safety and health laws. many countries do  have those. can we  compute what it costs our manufacturers to observe osha. and should we  tack that onto the tariff. all right. how about solid waste disposal legislation and hazardous waste disposal. you can take our hazardous waste and go .out in the fieldand dump it somewhere because you will be slapped with a $1 million fine. and somebody might go to jail. add to that a cost because they have to send it to a special hazardous. waste processing plant. and let me tell you. that is expensive. that -is -far more expensive than -this clean air act is going to -be for many of our plants. what about the- cleanwater act. you talk to any plant in our country. they have invested literally millions of dollars in trying to clean the water. discharges -from their plants. is that happening all over the world. it certainly is  happening in poland. i read in one of -these articles the description of -what is happening in some of those rivers- in poland. and it is a shame. and we all deplore it. and we want to do something we can to help them. but i must say when they are struggling to get on their feet: over there. this will  be the first thing they tackle. that iswhere i would like to hear some answers to these when senators have a chance to reply. where do you draw the line. child safety laws.  child safety laws cost some money. you can have a 13yearold working in your plant. once upon a time in textile plants in theearly days of this century there would be 15yearolds. 14yearolds tending the looms .and bobbins. that is  true any more.: i suppose that cost some money to have to hire people and observethe childage limitation. -whatever itmight be -in certain states. 18 and above for* dangerous work. clearly. that cost a
. the passage of h.r. 5013 is crucial to the continued survival of many of the worlds most beautiful and prized exotic bird species. today many parrots. macaws and other popular bird species are in serious decline due in large measure to the pet trade. the united states plays a major role in this trade as the worlds largest importer of wild bi rdsimporting an estimated 500.000 birds each year for the pet trade. and that is  counting the tens of thousands of birds that are smuggled illegally into this country each year. if this continues. many species will  survive in the wild much longer. fortunately. for the wild birds. responsible representatives of the pet trade conservation organizations. and humane groups. concerned about this problem have worked together to craft a solution. last june. senator baucus and i introduced two bills. s. 1218 and s. 1219 to conserve wild birds. why two bills on the same subject with the same goal. because at that time. despite the fact that all the major groups involved in this issue were in agreement that something needed to be done to address this serious problem. they did  agree on a specific approach. by introducing two bills. we hoped to encourage the groups to reach a compromise on this issue. i am happy to report that hr. 5013 represents a reasonable compromise approach that has been agreed to by most. if  all. the affected groups. hr. 5013 establishes an immediate import moratorium on 11 species. these species were identified as most at risk from trade at the last meeting of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna [cites]-the treaty which governs international trade in wildlife. the import of any other species listed by cites as seriously affected by the trade would. with limited exceptions be banned one year after the date of enactment of h.r. 5013. clearly. this does  mean that people must stop buying these birds for pets. these birds can and are being bred in captivity. in fact. i understand the captive bred birds make better pets than the wildcaught variety. in a day when environmental issues are too often polarized between two extremes. this bill represents a compromise among a number of groups that are usually on different sides of most issues. in my view this is an accomplishment of great proportions due to the tireless work of a great many organizations since 1988--when the world wildlife fund first convened a working group on this problem. i also want to pay tribute to assistant secretary hayden of the department of the interior and the u.s. fish and wildlife service for their assistance and leadership on this issue. the passage of h.r. 5013 will greatly enhance the prospects of survival for a number of magnificent tropical and other bird species in the wild. i would also like to mention one other provision of h.r. 5013 which is  related to wild birds. this provision corrects errors made in the mapping of "otherwise protected areas" under the coastal barrier resources act. several areas located in th carolina- and virginia that were privately owned and either partially or entirely developed were inadvertently mapped as areas owned and protected by federal. state. or local government or a conservation organization. and therefore ineligible for federal flood insurance. this provision. as amended. corrects these errors and designates the entirely undeveloped portion of the area in virginia as a unit of the coastal barrier resources system.
