. thislandmark legislation is the product of 4 years of work by members of the environment and public works and energy and natural resoruces committees. the house merchant marine and fisheries and interior and insular affairs committees. the administration. the states. and an extremely broad coalition of conservation organizations. i want to particularly thank senators mcclure. wallop. johnston. and bumpers. and their staff for their extremely quick sequential review of s. 1740 in the energy and natural resources committee. which allowed this bill to come to the floor before adjournment. our distinguished colleagues on the energy and natural resources committee recognize as do many of the rest of us that we can afford to delay longer in our efforts to increase wetlands protection. already. more than onehalf of the 215 million acres of wetlands that once existed in the cotermis united states have been converted to upland areas. estimates indicate that there was a net loss of 9 million acres of wetlands between the mid1950s and mid1970s. the greatest losses during that period occurred in louisiana. mississippi. arkansas. th carolina. th dakota. south dakota. nebraska. florida. and texas. unfortunately. the rate of wetland loss does  appear to have diminished over the last decade. the u.s. fish and wildlife service estimates that "we are continuing to lose wetlands at the annual pace of nearly onehalf million acres. an area approximately 12 times the size of the district of columbia." the nations wetlands provide valuable goods and services for the american people. the department of the interior has stated that it is "well established that the loss of wetlands is one of the most serious environmental problems facing thenation today. with farreaching implications  only for fish and wildlife resources but also for outdoor recreation. business. agriculture. and flood control." recognition of the need for wetlands conservation first became widespread because of international concern for migratory birds which depend upon wetlands for survival. as far back as 1916. the united states and great britainacting for canadanegotiated the "convention for the protection of migratory birds." this convention was the first of five treaties that established an international. -cooperative effort to conserve migratory birds and their habitats. these treaties provide the foundation for national laws that grant the federal government the authority and responsibility to manage migratory birds and their habitats. in 1983. the u.s. supreme court confirmed that "[tihe protection of migratory birds has long been recognized as a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude. " " th dakota v. united states.  81773 (mar. 7. 1983). a federal role in the acquisition of wetland habitats for-*migratory birds has been recognized by congress for many years. the enactment of the migratory bird conservation act in 1929 and the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act in 1934 established the foundation of our present wetlands acquisition program. the migratory bird conservation act improved our ability -to meet our treaty obligations and provided authority for the acquisition of migratory bird habitat. funding for this acquisition is provided by section 4 of the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act in the form of the permanent appropriation from the migratory bird conservation fund. which contains moneys generated from the sale of these socalled duck stamps and certain surplus federal property. areas acquired are incorporated into the national wildlife refuge system. in the quarter century following enactment of these two pivotal laws. wetland acquisition increased dramatically. nevertheless. in 1959 theu.s. fish and wildlife service and the state fish and wildlife agencies jointly determined that protection and management of 12.5 million acres of waterfowl habitat in the cotermis united states was necessary to maintain existing waterfowl populations. to achieve this goal. the fish and wildlife service needed to acquire an additional 3.8 million acres and the states an additional 2.5 million acres. in 1961 congress passed the wetlands loan act to accelerate federal acquisition of migratory waterfowl habitat. this law. as amended. authorizes the appropriation of $200 million as a loan against future revenues from the sale of duck stamps. at the present cost of $7.50 per stamp. revenues are approximately $14.4 million per year. the authorization. of which about $190 million has been appropriated. expires on september 30. 1986. and. beginning october 1. 1986. 75 percent of the revenues raised from the sale of duck stamps must be used to repay the loan. only about $3.5 million would then remain available on an annual basis to purchase the necessary wetlands. the legislation before us today. therefore. is needed in order to avoid a decrease of this magnitude in a vital wetlands acquisition program. using duck stamp funds and funds advanced against future stamp sales under the wetlands loan act. the fish and wildlife service purchased in fee title or easement approximately 1.9 million acres toward their goal from 1959 to 1977. acquisition of the remaining 1.9 million wetland acres for conservation of migratory birds was to be completed during the 10year period between fiscal year 1977 and fiscal year 1986. over the past decade. however. the fish and wildlife service will have acquired less than 25 percent of the 1.9 million acres of waterfowl habitat identified for federal acquisition. similarly the states have acquired only about 20 -percent of the 2.5 million acres identified for state acquisition. in may 1986 the united states and canada signed the "th american waterfowl management plan." which describes the actions and size of the task  believed necessary to achieve waterfowl population goals that will satisfy current public demand. the plan calls for the acquisition. protection. or improvement of approximately 1.9 million acres in the united states and 3.7 million acres in canada. protection and improvement of more than 1 million acres of mallard and pintail breeding habitat is needed in the pothole area of the thcentral united states at an estimated cost of $237 million. in the lower mississippi rivergulf coast region. the plan estimates that 686.000 acres of wintering habitat are needed. and roughly 80.000 acres of additional wintering habitat are needed in the central valley of california. the cost to achieve these wintering habitat protection and improvement goals would probably exceed $217 million. finally. black ducks need an additional 50.000 acres of. migration and wintering habitat along the east coast of the united states and 10.000 acres in the great lakesst. lawrence lowlands in the united states. at an estimated cost of $23 million. thus. the total cost for habitat protection in the united states identified by the th american waterfowl management plan approaches $500 million. the required waterfowl habitat protection and improvement in canada may reach $1 billion. the cost of providing this habitat protection will have to be shared by governmental and governmental entities in the united states and canada. federal and state spending alone wont do the job. the emergency wetlands resources act of 1986 will. however. provide a guarantee of approximately $40 million per year for federal acquisition of wetlands. of this approximately $30 million will be raised from user fees and $10 million will come from the current duties paid on imported arms and ammunition. two years ago congress took a similar approach by putting the duties paid on fishing and boating equipment into the wallopbreaux fund for sport fisheries managment. the wetlands act also provides authority for congress to appropriate additional state and federal wetland acquisition moneys from the land and water conservation fund. which presently authorizes $900 million each year. primarily from offshore oil and gas revenues. for park and refuge purchases. the increased authority for federal acquisition of wetlands under the land and water conservation fund act provided by this bill should  force the existing appropriations for land acquisition to be divided further. annual spending from the fund historically has been far less than the authorized $900 million. rather than forcing reductions in the amount spent for parks. refuges. forests. and endangered species. this bill should serve to underline the tremendous need for increased appropriations from the land and water fund.
