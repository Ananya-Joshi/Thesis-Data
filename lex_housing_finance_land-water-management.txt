one of the concerns expressed by hud is that these monthly payments should  be increased to the point where they would be beyond the ability to pay of the likely mobile homebuying population. this could be a very serious problem. i believe there is aher amendment which may be offered which would increase mortgage limits by up to 50 percent. in the $30.000 range. this could lead to a substantial increase in defaults because the monthly payments would be beyond the reach of the population that buys mobile homes.
