. the soviet unions renewed drive against religion and the imposition of death sentences upon 12 jews that we k of including 4 in vilna. lithuania. for alleged illegal exchange transactions and private speculation in goods. have sent a shudder throughout the civilized world. our generation has good reason to be sensitive to attacks on jews. realizing that whatever are the alleged offenses of which they are accused. they are often used as scapegoats to divert attention from internal troubles. moreover. we have learned that such persecution in a country where the antisemitic tradition is so deeply rooted as the u.s.s.r.. may well be the forerunner of even more widespread oppression and tyranny. while past experience shows there may  be much hope for men and women who have been condemned. appeals should be made by religious organizations and leading citizens throughout the world for justice and mercy in an effort to halt this inhuman course of action in the u.s.s.r.-a course of action which involves cruel and inhuman punishments by our lights in the free world. even if the offense be proved and without any right of appeal. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record the exchange of correspondence i have had with the department of state on the situation in the soviet unions persecution of jews. and the appeals for clemency in the case of the jews in vilna and other soviet cities by bishop james a. pike. of the episcopal diocese of california. which was made in a letter to the new york times. march 13. 1962. a cablegram i sent to ambassador llewellyn thompson on march 12. 1962. on behalf of my constituents who are blood relatives of the condemned jews. an appeal by the board of deputies of british jews. and a report entitled "hostile soviet press." both in the jewish chronicle. london. february 23. 1962.
