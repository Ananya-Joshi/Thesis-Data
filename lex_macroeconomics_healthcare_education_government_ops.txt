 of the united states in which many of us have joined. it.opens up a totally new world in terms of the training of people. of how to deal with the unemployed. of the kinds of jobs which government may have to give as public service jobs. and so on. i deeply believe this is the most inative aspect of this bill. it will be a gr eat challenge to the educational agencies and it will be a great challenge to the prime sponsorship. it is extremely desirable from every point of view. one thing i wouid like to point out is when we speak about work study we are also talking about community colleges which mainly teach professional subjects and in many cases quasiprofessional subjects. like dental technicians. or something like that. this is critically important because by doing that. they begin more nearly to match the training with the person. i congratulate the senator on our work.
