. on behalf of the senator from illis . the senator from montana . and myself. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to make contributions and bequests to unicefthe united nations childrens fundtax deductible. the bill would reverse a 1958 ruling by the internal revenue service. which interpreted current law as permitting only domestic charities to be eligible for taxexempt status. this ruling has :resulted in a decline in contributions to unicef. which is one of the greatest lifesaving and lifegiving agencies in modern history. all the nations of the united nations have joined in this effort to wage a war against the ravages of disease and hunger which afflict so many areas of the world. although governments are the principal supporters of unicef. we must do everything we can to promote individual participation in unicef. to demonstrate the deep american interest in the welfare of the impoverished and diseased children of the world. in fact. i do  think i need describe further to this body the lifegiving functions of unicef to children all over the world. the important work of unicef was dramatized for millions of americans in a prizewinning television show. produced by edward r. murrow. "the secret life of danny kaye." which was repeated only last night over the cbs television network. incidentally. danny kaye was here. the other day. to give his own support to this effort. my bill would amend the internal revenue code. so as to give. for unicef. the same federal tax exemption  enjoyed by domestic charitable organizations. i hope very much the bill will receive early attention. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the record. in connection with my remarks.
