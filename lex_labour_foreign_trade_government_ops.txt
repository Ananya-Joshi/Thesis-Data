 of a select committee on posteuropean recovery program policy paralleling the work of the eatonherter committee in the eightieth congress which prepared the ground for congressional approval of the european recovery program. congress. too. can make its contribution to a solution of the momentous british crisis and such section will go far toward avoiding the dangerous recriminations  coming from both sides of the atlantic. berating the labor government is fruitless. we would  tolerate any interference with our internal political affairs and we can hardly expect that the british will do so.  would we want them or any other free people to do so. what we have a right to insist on are measures for stimulating british production efficiency and reducing production costs. also measures for british and european currency stabilization and better financial management in britain. these points are well made in two pertinent editorials from the london ecoist which i am inserting in the appendix.
