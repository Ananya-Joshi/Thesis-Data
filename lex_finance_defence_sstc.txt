 of rca in 1930. during world war ii. he was a leader in military communications. and today. he is the moving force in the field of space communications. as chairman of the board of rca. general sarf heads a corporation with 25 manufacturing plants in the united states and 14 plants overseas. its sales top $1 billion annually. the david sarf research center at princeton. n.j.. is today the leading communications laboratory in the world.
. along with a large number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. i have introduced an amendment. amendment  610. to the bill s. 3164. pending before the senate labor and public welfare committee to extend the ecoic opportunity act. the basic charter of the war on poverty. our amendment would establish a publicprivate ecoic opportunity corp.. which would. like the communications satellite corp.. combine public and private enterprise resources. in this case to add the private sector in a major way to the nations antipoverty effort. a recent article in look magazine. entitled "the big business dogooders: private war on poverty." by look senior editor t. george harris. provides some excellent insights into the contributions business and industry are already making. without expectation of profit. to the public interest in this most important domestic field. in my judgment these contribtuions are substantial evidence of the emous potential which our proposed ecoic opportunity corporation would have through its stimulation and massing of many individual and corporate antipoverty efforts. i ask unanimous consent that the article. as well as a recent speech i have made on the subject of "the untapped resources for the war on poverty." which seeks to relate our proposed ecoic opportunity corporation to the racial disturbances which are plaguing so many of our cities. be inserted into the record at this point.
