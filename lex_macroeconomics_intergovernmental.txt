by way of moving on to other ideas. i believe that the capital issues committee is the more moderate of the two programs. if we passed an interest equalization tax law. it would take a great deal of work to undo it when we felt it had served its purpose. on the other hand. the committee can be set up at 10 oclock on a monday morning. and a week later. if we do  like it. we can do away with it. it seems to me that that kind of discipline is much less decisive and a much less complete commitment than would be the case if we passed a law. if we did pass a law. i would hope it would be for only a short time. perhaps for a year. or for 2 years at most. and perhaps we should couple the law with the capability of termination on the part of the president. if we found it did  work or if it worked adversely to american interests.
. i call to the attention of senators an important editorial in this mornings new york times entitled. "controls for the dollar." ing the dramatic improvement in our balance of payments in the third quarter. the editorial takes strong exception to the administrations interest equalization tax proposal. and instead. should capital outflow continue at a disturbing rate. it recommends the establishment of a capital issues committee. i fully agree. as i have stated at least on two occasions in the past the interest equalization tax would  be an effective instrument in dealing with the problem of capital outflows. the decline in capital outflows in the third quarter. in my view. is largely due to the uncertainty created by the pending measure rather than the tax that would be placed on capital exports. should the measure become law. there were other key factors that contributed to the improved thirdquarter figures. namely an increase in the rediscount rate and the improved competitive position of u.s. exports. resulting from stable u.s. prices while western europe is suffering from inflation. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the new york times editorial dated ember 18. 1963. as well as recent articles from the wall street journal and the new york times offering further evidence that what may well be the basic reasons for the recent improvement in the balance of payments.
i am grateful to the senator from kansas. who is a member of the committee on finance. i understand that in the committee he opposed this very illadvised measure. aher point which i believe is important as a basis upon which to discuss the question is as follows: even if we do impose the interest equalization tax. will we actually dry up in any material way u.s. private foreign investment. the answer is  because even after we had imposed the tax. it would still be so much more attractive to raise funds in the united states that the tax would be paid. the money would be raised. and the dollars would flow out just the same.
this would be a tough nut. the treasury has actually issued a memorandum under the aegis of its general counsel. in which it deals with a great many questions under the heading of "the constitutionality of the equalization tax act." it is dated august 6.
 to appoint an advisory committee on capital export policy in view of the fact that right  it is very clear that the interest equalization tax has been ineffective in dealing with continued high outflows of private capital. even more capital is flowing out  under the same headingsthat went out before the tax was imposed. heretofore we had problems caused by foreign bond issues and other foreign securities that were sold to americans. the outflow on this account has been cut down very drastically by the interest equalization tax. what has happened since the tax became effective is that other types of capital outflow. such as longterm and shortterm loans. have risen. and direct investments have remained at high level.
this is important to me. i have always fought against the interest equalization tax on the ground it represents a protectionist device. however. we have a balanceofpayments problem which is  congealed around the interest equalization tax. Â• i understand the difficulties of the administration in going along with people such as me. . a certain background has been built up in utilization of the tax. based on the fact i think it was unwise taxation and unwise for our country to take in view of the fact that this is the leading money capital of the world. i wrote a letter to the secretary of the treasury on saturday. he responded.  in terms of the 30day extension. which is understandable. but the bill as it came from the house. he made the situation clear. . i ask unanimous consent that the exchange of correspondence i had with the secretary of the treasury may be printed in the record.
. i address the senate today to urge prompt action in dealing with the interest equalization tax extension. in doing so. i urge those senators who may be responsible. unwittingly. for its delay to exercise the necessary statesmanship and thus avoid the costly and dangerous consequences which the prolongation of the present situation will bring. last month the senate passed an extension of the tax. together with an amendment exempting gun dealers from keeping records of persons to whom longgun ammunitionexcept for .22 caliber rimfireis sold. the house had earlier passed a simple extension of the tax. the gun control amendment is the only substantive difference between the senate and the house versions. it is the only bar to prompt passage of the interest equalization tax extension. i strongly urge that measures be taken to separate the ammunition amendment from the parent interest equalization tax extension. this kind of hoable compromise would remove the uncertainty which the lapse of the interest equalization tax has caused. it would also speed the day when serious consideration could be given by both houses to the amendment itself. because both houses have. in effect. approved extension of the interest equalization tax. and because the taxif extendedshould have uninterrupted applicability. the treasury department has requested securities dealers and exchanges to continue to regard the tax as if it were still in effect. most of us. therefore. have been lulled into believing that the lapse of the interest equalization tax on september 30 was of little consequencc. speaking on behalf of the banking and financial community. which is so heavily concentrated in new york. i must say that the uncertain status of the interest equalization tax has had a serious and damaging effect on international financial transactions. it has hampered the efforts of some united states companies to follow through on financing plans abroad and has affected the operations of securities dealers who buy and sell foreign securities in this country. so we are  dealing here merely with an action which affects a small segment of the financial community. virtually every major american corporation with international affiliates is affected by the interest equalization tax. americans in large numbers are deterred through the interest equalization tax from purchasing foreign securities. i opposed the interest equalization tax when it was first proposed. yet i had to support its extension after it had become law. in my testimony before the finance committee. i made the point that the interest equalization tax  forms part of a larger system of controls on capital movements which can be dismantled helterskelter without dangerous and costly consequences. we are  incurring dangerous and costly consequences because the interest equalization tax has been allowed to lapse for more than a month. this constitutes a serious breach in the major system of controls on capital in the united states and has consequences seriously and adversely affecting our balance of payments and the strength of the american industrial investments overseas. we can continue for very long. in my judgment. the fiction that we do have a law when we do  have one. it is beginning very seriously to hamper legitimate security and investment operations and the financial strength of much of our country. i think the time has come to end this fiction by separating the two issues and allowing the extension of the interest equalization tax to pass and become law as both houses intend. this means separating the other issue which has  been passed by the senate and which will be taken up in the house. instead of holding the interest equalization tax hostage for the other amendment. i hope that wise statesmanship will prevail in the senate and allow this to be done.
