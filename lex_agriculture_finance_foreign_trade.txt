. u.s. sugar producers enjoy a level of subsidization unrivalled among other federal farm progams. each year. the federal government pays approximately $3.500 in benefits to each of 800.000 wheat farmers. and $9.000 in benefits to each of 300.000 milk producers. but under the sugar program. benefits average $250.000 per year per producer. we have heard a great deal about the sugar program being a ost program. you may ask yourself. then. what is the source of this great munificence. whos footing the bill. the american consumer is footing the billto the tune of almost $5 billion per year. nearly everything we eat has some sugar in itand we pay dearly for it. the domestic price of raw sugar is approximately five times its world market pricethat adds about $60 per year to the grocery bill of the average family of four. our sugar program is hing but a hidden tax. and a regressive one at that. simple fairness demands that we adopt the bradleygorton amendment. the bill before us freezes the loan rates for wheat. feed grains and* other commodities for one year. lowering them by 5 percent per year thereafter. sugar is treated differently. howeverits loan rate is held at the current inflated level -of 18 cents per pound for 4 years. there is excuse for this preferential treatment. by adopting the bradleygorton amendment. we will simply bring sugar into line with all other commodities. the adverse effects of high sugar price supports and tight import quotas have been well documented in a series of recent editorials criticizing u.s. sugar policy. these include high costs for u.s. manufacturers of processed foods containing sugar. many manufacturers are finding it impossible to compete with lowpriced products containing sugar purchased on the world market. without action to remedy the situation. some may have alternative but to move their operations overseas. this means more lost jobs. high sugar price supports also impose a heavy burden on developing countries. ably those in latin america and the caribbean. these countries have borrowed extensively from american banks and -depend heavily on export earnings to service their debts. to stave off major debt defaults among these third world countries. the united states must keep its markets open to ldc exports. maintaining this protectionist scheme as welfare for the american sugar industry is totally inconsistent with our obligation to keep markets open and to prevent damage to american lenders. i urge my colleagues to give their support to this very modest proposal. fairness. common sense. and consistency require that we do so.
