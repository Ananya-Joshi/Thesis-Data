i think this. first. i am  willing to concede that in broward or dade county. or wherever it might be. inevitably. if do you  have flow control. your waste is going to end up in an environmentally damaging situation. that does  necessarily follow. we have all kinds of laws on the books dealing with the handling of waste in this country. and if some other outfit comes inwaste management. or whoever it is--and hauls it. they can just take it and dump it in some lovely field above a ground water area. they have to dispose of it in a proper way. but the whole root of what we are dealing with is the commerce clause of the constitution of the united states. which says that there should be free interstate transportation and movement in our nation. that has served us pretty well. you might say. "how petty can you get. why should miami. or wherever.  be permitted to handle their waste. and if everybody has to take it to one place. and that is the only place. that is the way we want to run our business." but the supreme court has said that is against the constitution. i k we can fix it up. and the supreme court. as you pointed out. has also said we can straighten it out. so far. we have chosen  to take that extra step.
i thank the distinguished senator from massachusetts. he is absolutely correct in his view of the situation. what good does it do to establish the illegality if after it has been established and after it has been adjudicated you say good day and goodby. i mean. that is what we are talking about. there can be remedy. if there can be emedy asked for. first. the court can hear what is  being asked for. that takes the courts out of the picture and then insofar as the remedy or lack thereof. what happens to the poor plaintiff. it renders meaningless whatever law is on the books whether it be congressionally passed or whether it be the constitution without a remedy.
