. but the central intelligence agency. the atomic energy commission. the department of state. the department of the treasury. the department of defense. the department of the army. the department of the navy. the department of the air force. the u.s. arms control and disarmament agency. the department of justice. the national aeronautics and space administration. and the agency of international development. so the agency for international development. for example. has a superior standing to the senate of the united states. and that is what we are asked to perpetuate. when it comes to the classification of "secret." which stands in the same light. let us see who can stamp the classification of "secret" on documents: the department of transportation. the federal communications commission. the exportimport bank of the united states. the department of commerce. the u.s. civil service commission. the u.s. information agency. a subordinate agency of the department of state. the general services administration. the department of health. education. and welfare. the civil aeronautics board. the federal maritime commission. the federal power commission. the national science foundation. and the overseas private investment corporation. all -of those agencies. if they classify a document. make a senator use his constitutional immunity if he is going to use it. and it puts the whole senate in a twilight zone if it is going to do anything about it. with respect to its procedures. the situation is simply intolerable under present conditions. and the senate. in my judgment. can. and i hope will . wait. but the senator has exercised his privilege very properly. the debate. if continued until 2 oclock. would result in this matter going to the calendar anyway. so unless the senator from nebraska wishes to speak agaiviously he doesi will. at the moment when the debate is finished. ask unanimous consent that the resolution go to the calendar.
