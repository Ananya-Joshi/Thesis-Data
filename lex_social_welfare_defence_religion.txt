. the great jewish philosopher. moses mainmonides. wrote some 800 years ago: the eighth and most meritorious degree of charity is to anticipate charity by preventing poverty. namely. to assist the reduced fellow man. either by a considerable gift. or a loan of money. or by teaching him a trade. or by putting him in the way of business. so that he may earn an honest livelihood and  be forced to the dreadful alternative of holding out his hand for charity. to this scripture alludes when it says: "and if thy brother be waxen poor. and fallen in decay with thee. then thou shalt relieve him. yea. though he be a stranger or a sojourner. that he may live with thee." this is the highest step and the summit of charitys golden ladder. this philosophy remains as strong today in the hearts of many as when first uttered in the 12th century. jewish organizations are participating in the war against poverty with the same concern and fervor as are their protestant and catholic brethren. the council of jewish federations and welfare funds has provided me a detailed report of jewish activities in the war against poverty. i ask unanimous consent to have the report printed in the record.
