 reagans efforts on behalf of shcharansky paid off. and  we must work to obtain similar results for the thousands of refuseniks who may  be as famous as shcharansky. but whose stories are less tragic. one such story is that of boris agarkov. a 48yearold computer scientist from leningrad. although soviet authorities allowed boris to visit israel in 1966 as part of an official delegation. he and his family were later refused permission to emigrate there. both boris and his wife geralina lost their jobs as a result of their applications for exit visas. and have since faced serious financial problems. despite his training in computers. boris  works as a garage attendant. boris son. dimitri. has also suffered for being a member of a refusenik family. he was expelled from school in 1985. officially because he was a backward student. actually it was because he married an american. he too has applied for an exit visa. which was denied. and his wife has been denied entry to visit him. the agarkov familys tragic story could be repeated over and over again. with different names and cities but the same pattern of persecution. i hope all of my colleagues will join me in continuing to press the soviet government for an end to this persecution. soviet policy denies jews some of the most basic human rightsthe right to think and believe as one chooses. and to preserve ones cultural heritage. during this feast of passover. when jews the world over celebrate their rich traditions. let us hope that our plea is heard by soviet leaders. and that they grant those basic rights to their jewish citizens. or let them move to countries where they can live freely and openly as jews.o
