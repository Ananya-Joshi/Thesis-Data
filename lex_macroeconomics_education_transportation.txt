to get into aher stella school case. the national memorial for alexander hamilton should be established. i have personally inspected the house. it is going to wrack and ruin. it needs to be dealt with and cared for. i k we can depend absolutely upon the feelings of the majority leader. a great speech was made to the senate the other day by the senator from virginia bearing out the urgent desirability in the national interest for the establishing of the memorial. and other senators have expressed their feelings in this regard. my colleague and i are putting the measure back into the procedural stream. so that it will  be substantively disadvantaged by the situation which surrounds using it as the vehicle for the poll tax debate. we have every faith in the majority leaders assurances. and we believe the committee will adhere to its previous position in reporting the original measure.
