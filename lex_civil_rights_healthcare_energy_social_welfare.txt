. the bill i introduce todayidentical to the bill i introduced in the 92d congressseeks to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in federally funded research activities and is patterned upon nih research guidelines which seek to accomplish that desirable obj ective. the recently annced hearings on the critical issue of the rights of human subjects in biomedical research by the senate health subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfareof which i am ranking miity memberwill provide an excellent opportunity to focus public attention on the problem and determine the adequacy of my legislative efforts to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects. every 7 years there is a doubling of recorded kledge and almost every day new powers over human life and health are being discovered in our research laboratories. there is doubt but that we must constantly and continually encourage research into the great enigma of man and his world if we are to eventually overcome the abysmal depths of igance .and disease. but we must guard against self delusion lest it harm that precarious quality of life which is so uniquely humanfor being human. we must also always be humane. scientific inquiry must constantly be blended with judgment. compassion and empathy. the true synthesis of humaneness and humanity. tragic newspaper accounts about human beings in syphilis research projects and other reported experiments involving human subjectscited in a library of congress. congressional research service. august 4. 1972. report--demonstrate the need for the reintroduction of the bill i introduced in the 92d congress. while it is true that much of the research involving human subjects at riskexclusive of human subject research and experimentation undertaken pursuant to the informed patient consent amendment to the food. drug. and cosmetics act which i authoredis done under the auspices of hew research guidelines assuring ethical guidance. i believe congress has a responsibility to assure meaningful legal controls of federally supported research activities involving human subjects. it is imperative that we maintain a constant vigil lest the zeal which first motivated and then impelled man forward in his neverending quest for enlightenment be like the sorcerers apprentice. exceeding its bounds and unfettered cause us to outdistance our own capacity for commonsense and decency. this could easily result in moral suicide. at the same time. excessive rigidity in the regulation of human subject experimentation because of some improprieties in ethical self regulation would. i believe. be to the disadvantage of the individual and society. while civilized society can tolerate callous disregard of human rights for any purposenazi germanys atrocities in thename of clinical science being the most horrendous examplemankind would be badly served if we write rigid laws to govern research pracrank 1970 1965 1960 61. lockheed aircraft ------------------.................... 97 94 62. malaysia -------------------------------- 71 65 68 63. marcor(chicago) ---------- -------------- 97 -------------------------64. mexico- -------------------------------- 14 18 20 65. mobil oil ------------------------------- 48 49 52 66. montecatini edison ------------------------ -- --96--- -----------------67. montgomery ward (chicago) ----------------------------- ---------_.99 68. morocco ------------------------------- 84 70 72 69. national coal board ------------------------------- -
