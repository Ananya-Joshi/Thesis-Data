i doubt if there is any member of this body who more earnestly desires to breach the iron curtain. or who would sacrifice more to see it done. i should like to ask the senator from california one or two questions based upon my own experience in the house committee on foreign affairs. i served there when the european recovery program was approved. i served there when congress first approved aid to yugoslavia. upon each occasionwithout divulging anything more than what is historythe fulcrum of decision was this point: the soviet union having constantly opposed any of its satellites obtaining ecoic aid from the west. and. as a matter of fact. having made the standard of judgment as to the heresy of tito the fact that he sought ecoic aid from the west. what we were always looking for was aher satellite which would seek ecoic aid. that being to us among the prime indicia of the fact that it was ready to break away. or break away sufficiently for our purpose. what is the significance of such action. i ask the distinguished miity leader if he will be good egh to comment on that point. being a new member. i do  like to rise to speak unless i can make a definite contribution. i heard the discussion with respect to the looting of poland. which is standard soviet technique. we are dealing with a situation. in essence. which existed before gomulka. today the real point of difference between yugoslavia and poland. as the distinguished senator has pointed out. is some element of military control. is that  answered by the fact that gomulka is ready to commit the greatest soviet heresy in history. up to date. which is to ask aid from the west. therefore does my friend from kentucky  have a great deal to his point that. if that be the case. if poland is ready to commit that heresy. we would be unwise to relinquish the weapon which we have by turning down a request for such aid.
