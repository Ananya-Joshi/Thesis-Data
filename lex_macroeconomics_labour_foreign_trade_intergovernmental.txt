there is question that it represents. on money. an aspect of protectionism. second. it has already been so emasculated by exceptionsincluding some exceptions for japan as well as a general exception for canada. and its own exclusions. which represent significant exceptionsthat it runs counter to what i think is the desirability of the united states continuing to be the banker for the world. it tends toward controls. which in this situation i believe would only be necessary if there were other way to accomplish the desired result. i shall refer in a moment to other ways in which this can and should be done. finally. it would  be effective. since even with the inclusion of the tax there would still be a brake in terms of interest rates for raising money in this country. lastly. and very importantly. it is completely confounded by the fact that we are  beginning to turn the corner on foreign private investment. obtaining more income. leaving out the undistributed profitswhich are  distributedmerely taking into consideration money actually brought here from abroad. we are  getting more income from foreign investment per annum than the money which goes out. without the interest equalization tax. we are already showing a profit. as it were. in terms of the international balance of payments from that account. under those circumstances the whole thing falls like a house of cards. i thoroughly agree with my colleague.
