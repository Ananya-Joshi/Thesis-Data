in that article i have suggested the possibility that west berlin be incorporated in west germany and be a part of itor a land. as it is called. we would then have the state of west germany with all the juridical rights and the protection of the nato treaty. that is one possibility. aher possibility is that we all k that several hundred million dollars worth of business is done between west germany and east germany to this very day. it is said to be indispensable business in very important materials essential to the production of east german industrial plants. at one time it will be remembered that the east germans threatened to interfere with commercial traffic from west germany to west berlin. the west germans threatened to retaliate by cutting off all trade with east germans about as fast as one could snap his fingers. i only say those things to indicate that we are by means powerless with respect to berlin. i am beginning to feel. as i expressed todayand it is my duty to express it--that because we are apparently fixed in one position. giving us freedom of maneuver whatsoever. the salami tactics which the soviet republic is using in berlin are ruthless. brutal. and to the death in terms of shooting people who try to get over that wall. to the outrage of all civilized communities of mankind. we do  have to stand and take it. . i shall return to this subject again. but i open it  in the expectation that our government will explore the possibilities of other positions from the one which it has taken as recently as this morning. i thank my colleague for making it possible for me to speak at greater length than the time allotted.
