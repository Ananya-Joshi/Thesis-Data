madam president is it  a fact that two points deserve to be emphasized in this particular debate which are pertinent: my first question. therefore. is based on the fact that the other body just took a vote the other day on the harkin amendment which sought to put exactly. almost exactly. the same kind of a socalled human rights amendment on the exportimport bank bill. the amendment was rejected 286 to 103. because it simply did  belong in a bill dealing with an agency involved in export financing. which is like the international monetary fund essentially a banking and monetary agency. so i ask the senator from idaho whether or  the recent is pertinent to some action on a similar human rights amendment in terms of showing the views of a coordinate body on this issue.
