the argument of the senator from wisconsin is rather surprising. because i have  heard him say that it is charity to give high. fixed farm supports or checks for the conservation of land. i have  heard him say that such support represents the fact that the united states is sorry for the individuals who are getting the checks. there are all kinds of programs costing billions of dollars for which the federal government is paying. and paying directly to people. programs which we all fight for and think are right. they represent demeaning of the individuals dignity. my point is that my approach would give the individual a vested stake in where this money went. it does  fail to have some terminal points in the sense of responsibility with respect to it. i will  say for a minute that there is hing to be said for the social security approach. that it is all wrong. and that it is the greatest vice mankind ever saw. of course . that is sense. the only point i make is that on balance. taking all of the arguments for the social security system and all of the arguments for this system. and considering the sociological break with the past which the social security system in health would represent. i believe my program is preferable for our country. in other words. i am  trying to devastate the senator from wisconsin with my argument. i think there is an answer to his particular point and i have made it. but i also wished to point out that this is one of the questions that he and others like him will argue most sincerely as being a strong point in favor of their plan.
