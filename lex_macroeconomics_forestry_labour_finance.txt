it seems to me that one thing sticks out in this whole thing. and that is the difference between wish and performance. i think phase iii was instituted because of the wish to get over wageprice controls. this is legitimate and thoroughly american. e of us approves of it. we wish the open market would do the job. that is the course of freedom. but the only thing that will get over wage and price controls is the necessary productivity to keep pace with the increase in the demand. including the overseas demand. which today is longer to be considered as a christmas tree proposition. because we live or die by what we buy abroad in the way of minerals and fuel. and we are going to be doing more rather than less of the same thing. so it seems to me that. as the exhortation from on high did  workthat is what it was. and it was honest and sincere. and a good try. the conditions which dictated august 15. 1971. and which dictated phase ii thereafter. are the conditions which persist. the exhortation did  work. and adult americans are  so inflexible that we have to perish before we recognize that fact. and take the necessary measures to abate a disastrous situation.
