. i have reported before that pan american is greatly interested in and has supported vigorously this bill. * its activity is understandable. in the fiscal years 195156. of the 32 airlines still receiving subsidies from the federal treasury. pan american world airways. inc.. received $219.768.000. as of december 31. 1954. it owned 50 percent of the stock of pan americangrace airways. inc.. which. during the same period. received subsidies from the federal treasuly of $28.511.000. the 2 corporations. therefore. received a total of $248.279.000 in this 6year period. out of $502.915.000 paid to all these 32 airlinessee tabulation. record. july 18. pages 13422 and 13423. also. if this bill had been law during the 5 calendar years 1951. 1952. 1953. 1954. and 1955. according to a tabulation prepared by the department of commerce. pan american would have received $17.288.000 in additional subsidies out of a total of $21.900.700see tabulation. recoad. july 18. page 13418. it is wonder that pan american would like to destroy the principle of "need" which is a fundamental and essential part of existing law. this "need" standard is  an accident or an illconsidered principle adopted by congress. it is based upon fairness to all our airlines and a reasonable regard for the public treasury. it has been administered with reasonable success for 18 years and one can possibly say that it has affected adversely the remarkable growth of our airline system. much has been said by proponents of this legislation as to its alleged relationship to attracting capital on reasonable terms. this brings up the question as to why any carrier should receive. as it s tl d s c v a c t s c t t f t urely would under this bill. a dollar of terms. it certainly is evidence of this ability

i have ridden in many of them. i should like to tell the senator why what he is asking is impractical. if a passenger had to pay $24 to go from newark airport to la guardia or from la guardia airport to newark airporttoday it costs $9. which is a reasonable. ecoic chargeif the passenger were charged $24. he would  use the service. and if he would  use it. we would lose the benefit of the present experiment. i have just got off the plane. having returned from new york. i have seen the helicopters which connect all the airports take off and land. we are experimenting with the publics participation in a very important field. we will solve the problem of the metropolitan areas within a hundred miles of the big cities. which is one of the grave problems affecting metropolitan areas today. through the use of the helicopter. for example. new york can use the macarthur airport. which is 70 miles from new york. because it is too far away. there is adequate helicopter service which can be reasonably carried on on an ecoic basis because the cost with present planes is prohibitive. the present helicopters have too low a capacity. this whole operation is in a completely experimental stage. it offers incalculable benefits to the whole nation. in terms of assisting heavily populated areas which are just outside metropolitan areas. by tying the metropolitan areas together with a view to the national defense. the military authoritiesand i am a reserve officer. and i am aware of thistell us that this is the kind of help they need. i can say that it is simply unecoical to charge what it costs. it is very wise for the united states to help this development for a time. until it secures a breakthrough. i am glad there are 35 applications. i wish there were 350. the senator from delaware. whom i love and admire. should realize that the united states is  only what it spends and what it owes. but what it is worth and what it makes. certainly the united states has a national debt of $295 billion. but it has a gross national production of $500 billion. this country is worth  less than a trillion dollars. when the united states had a gross national debt of $100 billion. it was a less good credit risk because it did  have as much and was  earning as much. the question is  that we should  spend. the question is that we should spend wisely. for good purposes. purposes which are constructive. that is what this country is about. i do  want the president of a corporation  to spend. he will go broke tomorrow. what can he do with assets. it is earnings that counts. that is what we are talking about here. we are talking about making our country richer. more productive. more ecoical. i think it would be very shortsighted if this amendment were to be agreed to.
. let us  get euphoric around here. this bill and this change for which senator moynihan contends are  going to make it or break it.  is senator brookes amendment whether it is adopted or . we are talking about the south bronx. which is bankrupt of jobs. that is what is troubling the south bronx. it is in a city that is broke. for 10 years. we have been trying to buy. for $10 million. the railroad yards up there in order to establish an industrial complex. and for 10 years we have  been able to raise the money. so. while i appreciate the lineaments of this argumentwhich is legitimate and properthe world is  going to fall in. matter which side wins. neither is the south bronx going to be redeemed or saved from fires or restructured. it is in very. very deep trouble. and it is going to take a massive infusion of capital and of opportunities for jobs in order to make it remotely viable.
