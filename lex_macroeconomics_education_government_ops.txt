. i am thoroughly in agreement. inasmuch as i am so heavily involved in the other manpower program. i want to be sure that this would work both ways. that is. receiving the benefit of everything they learn in manpower and being able to absorb everything from the manpower area. we just voted public service jobs this morning. i am  in complete agreement with it. but it is in the bill. for both rural and urban areas. i thank the senator.
