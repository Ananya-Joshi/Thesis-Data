subsequently said: . i was  on the floor. because i was in the committee on labor and public welfare considering airline strike legislation. when the senator from connecticut made a statement on the federal role in urban affairs. i am a member of the subcommittee headed by the senator from connecticut . and will observe what is done with the greatest of interest. i hope we shall have from the administration more than generalities about eliminating ghetto conditions. but rather that we will have solid action in which the administration and congress can join in order to bring about improved intergovernmental cooperation including a better system for financing the improvements of our cities.
i hope the senator will keep a place on the schedule for what we need to do about the railroad strike. which is impending on april l1th unless we take some action or unless the parties settle it. we had a hearing this morning. i might tell the senator. which indicates that at best. they have  settled. i do  k whether the prospects are good or bad. but i do think the leadership should be informed that the committee on labor and public welfare will need some accommodation for that.
the distinguished senator must k that it does  qualify under the terms of my amendment as a private pension plan. that is all i am arguing. i do  want to get it confused with railroad retirement to which my amendment does  apply. that is admitted. the fact that my amendment covers only private pension plans and does  affect railroad retirement at all. that is all i argue.
i e that the distinguished chairman of the labor and public welfare committee. senator williams. of new jersey. yesterday introduced a bill to permit selective strikes in the railroad industry. all of these bills will. i am sure. be given the most careful consideration by the committee when hearings are held in march.
