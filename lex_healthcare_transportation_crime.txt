. while i support this legislation. the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of 1966. it must  be considered as a panacea or cureall for the very real problem of driver deficiencies. we must remember that there is a driver behind the wheel of any unsafe vehicle. and sometimes an unsafe driver. there are many causes for accidents including but  limited to poor vision and poor driver training. among these causes is the serious problem of alcoholism. as i pointed out in connection with the introduction of my bill h.r. 14197 in my statement in the congressional record of march 31 at page 7336. alcoholism. and i do  mean the "skid row" type. is the fourth most serious health problem in the country. and it also takes its toll in driving accidents. aher cause is auto theft. as we all k. and as i set forth in connection with the introduction of my bill h.r. 16657 in my statement in the congressional record of july 28 at page 17550. joyriding juveniles or others who steal a car. are oblivious to the usual driver responsibilities. more should be done to prevent such thefts  only in prevention of crime but also to keep down accidents. and so i say that we must  only repair the machine. we must also concern ourselves with the man behind the machine.
