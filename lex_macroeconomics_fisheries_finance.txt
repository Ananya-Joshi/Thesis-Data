. the conference report on h.r. 14239. making appropriations for departments of state. justice. commerce. and the judiciary for fiscal year 1977 is on the floor for senate approval. i would like to take this opportunity to again comment on the need for a strong national undersea research program. undersea science and techogy will be more and more important in our future efforts to harvest. mine. farm. and protect the oceans. undersea techniques to gain kledge of our fisheries. for instance. will augment conventional research. it will give science the tools necessary to measure stocks directly and to describe such things as behavior. spawning. feeding and schooling necessary to manage fish populations effectively. even though undersea science and .techogy has been utilized almost 25 years in the united states. relatively little progress in this field has been realized. we can presently place scientists on the bottom of the ocean safely and efficiently in depths of over 100 feet for extended periods of time. these deficiencies in progress toward undersea capabilities may be attributed to the lack of coordination of and commitment to a national oceans policy and program at the federal level. the oceanlab manned habitat system. initial funding of which is included in the pending appropriations bill. will be the focal point of a program to develop new capabilities in undersea science and techogy. until the oceanlab is actually constructed and operational. i urge the national* oceanic and atmospheric administration to continue their support of the manned undersea science and techogy office and to continue their programs of undersea marine studies. diver physiology. techogical testing. and diver training. again. i wish to pay particular thanks to the distinguished senator from rhode island for his important support of funding for the oceanlab and related undersea research programs.
