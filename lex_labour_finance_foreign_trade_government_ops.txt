i thank the senator from oregon. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point a statement by andrew j. biemiller. director of the legislative department. american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations. before the senate committee on banking and currency on the proposed community facilities act of 1958.
i join with the senator from virginia in his welldeserved praise of  on the banking and currency committee in the hope that mr. carys fine career in government and his fine work for the people of the united states may be crowned by the enactment of the statute which is uniquely a labor of his own.
