i am sympathetic toward the senators amendment insofar as it seeks to restrict the ambit of the administrators authority to qualify assistance to public mass transit systems. i would support the senators amendment if it were limited to eliminating the coercive power of the administrator over housing and other grants and loans. i am concerned about an inability to do anything about a diminution of security for a loan. the rate schedule represents the dollars and cents basis upon which a loan or grant is made. if this is swept away through action of a state or municipal agency. how do we protect what seems to be the honest and best judgment in these situations.
