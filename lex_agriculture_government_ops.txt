if the senator will indulge me. certainly we are assured that the controversial billsthe farm bill and the military procurement billare the only two bills which wi:l stand in the way. second. the senator will have to move to take up the farm bill and the military procurement bill. if any of us feel strongly about the order of precedence at that time. we shall naturally have an opportunity to bring before the senate that issue. i hope we will  have to.
i think the senator from montana ks why i have objected. if this were a complete package. and senators knew when action on the military procurement authorization bill and the farm bill would be concluded. bills which the senator from montana says he proposes to bring up. and if senators knew that on march 4. when the report would be due in the senate. with whatever provisions were in it. debate on the motion to take up the civil rights bill would start. one would understand the situation. but as i understand the situation. a unanimousconsent request was made to refer the civil rights bill to committee. if that request were granted. the military procurement authorization bill and the farm bill would come up for debate. and we do  k how long that debate would take. it might take until march 4 or march 14. under those circumstances. while i am most sympathetic to what the senator from montana has in mind. with respect. to satisfying an appreciable number of senators--on this subject. i respectfully suggest that the matter be deferred overnight.
