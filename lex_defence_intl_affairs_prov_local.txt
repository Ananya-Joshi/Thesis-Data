. during the period july 37 i visited israel to meet with the leaders of the new government and to assess at first hand the situation and the mood of israel in the wake of the yom kippur war and the generational transfer of power implicit in the formation of a new government under prime minister yitzhak rabin. it would be a mistake to discount the gravity of the problems confronting israel but i was reassured to find israel in the hands of confident and competent new leadership. in my judgment. press reports have overemphasized the inevitable stresses and tensions which accompany such a watershed transfer of power to a new generation with new root and a new outlook. undoubtedly. the coalitionbuilding process and the narrowness of the rabin governments majority in the knesset have been accompanied by strenuous jockeying. played out against a mood of letdown and some apprehension respecting the future. following the traumatic experience of israels hardwon struggle last october. while in israel. i had long discussions with prime minister rabin. foreign minister qnd deputy prime minister allon. defense minister peres. former prime minister golda meir. chairman of the bank of israel zanbar and many others. including meetings with mayor of jerusalem kolleck. former foreign minister eban and former defense minister dayan. in addition. i had most useful conversations with ambassador keating and several members of his fine staff at the american embassy. on july 4. i flew to maalot to place memorial wreaths in the name of the people of new york on graves of the victims of the terrorist outrage that took such a dreadful toll of childrens lives. on july 5. i was. with foreign minister allon. a speaker at the commemorative luncheon of the israelamerican friendship society. i ask unanimous consent that the text of my speech on that occasion be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
