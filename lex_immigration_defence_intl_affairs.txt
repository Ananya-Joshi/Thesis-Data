. we are asked one other question: why should  the russians have a base in the western hemisphere when we have a base in turkey. which is on the border of the soviet union. the difference is that turkey has a government which represents its people. ody denies that fact. it is a nato partner. it is involved with us in that organization. second. and critically important. it is  we who threaten aggression against the world. it is  we who say we will send our rockets and missiles against the united states if somebody harms a hair of cubas head. or otherwise displeases the soviet union. it is khrushchev who is constantly rattling missiles. incorporated in the united nations charter. as well. are procedures to defend our treaty commitments in the free world against a voiced and determined threat. which we do  make. and which we have never made. so i see similarity between the situation of turkey and cuba. finally. there are those who say that if the western world acts in cuba. the russians may act with respect to berlin. turkey. or somewhere else. of course they may. they may do it on any aftern. or on any one of a hundred occasons. including the episode of the u2 plane which flew over russia. such a possibility ca be determinative of our policy. there is grave risk in any policy we undertake. but when we undertake it. we must stick to that policy withstanding the risk. because the policy is so persuasive.
