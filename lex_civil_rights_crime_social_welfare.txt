i will put it in . it was placed in the record by the senator from texas under date of september 14. 1943. the quotation which i read appears at page a4065. of course. there are other statements in the speech bearing on the point. but this paragraph. i think. may throw light on the particular thought: organized international cooperation can be successful only to the extent to which the nations of. the world are willing to accept certain fundamental propositions. first. each nation should maintain a stable government. each nation should be free to decide for itself the forms and details of its governmental organizationso long as it conducts its affairs in such a way as  to menace the peace and security of other nations. second. each nation sh6uld conduct its ecoic affairs in such a way as to promote the most effective utilization of its human and material resources and the greatest practicable measure of ecoic welfare and social security for all of its citizens. each nation should be free to decide for itself the forms of its internal ecoic and locial orgtnizationbut it should conduct its affairs in such a way as to respect the rights of others and to play its necessary part in a system of sound international ecoic relations. third. each nation should be willing to submit differences arising between it and other nations to processes of peaceful settlementi call the attention of the senator from vermont to the language there usedeach should be willing to submit differences arising between it and other nations to processes of peaceful settlement. and should be prepared to carry out other obligations that may devolve upon- it in an effective system of organized peace. all of this calls for the creation of a system of international relations based on rules of morality. law. and justice as distinguished from the anarchy of unbridled and discordant nationalisms. ecoic and political. the outstanding characteristic of such a system is liberty under law for nations as well as individuals. its method is peaceful cooperation.
subsequentlysaid: i can vote. in good conscience. .for the resolution offered by the enir senator from arkansas. -just a few days agothe report of the prekident~s commission on obscenity and porraphy was made available to the congress. the report is a volumis document of nearly 1.000 pages and is the productof 2 years of work by the commission. with the press of business being handled in the senate during th6 last 2 weeks. i have  yet had an opportunity to read the complete report. . i suspect. have most other members of this body. - yet. we are being asked in this resolution to reject the entire report out of hand. to vote on such a resolution is an illconsidered. hasty action which does an injustice to the commission members and to the public. the traffic in obscenity and porraphy is a very serious matter and should  be dealt with by castigating a presidential commission. some of whose members have views differing from those of members of the.senate. during the last few- years. we have received a number of reports of presidential commissions on such important and controversial.: issues.. as the draft. welfare reforn.-civil disturbances.. and. crime in the streets. for the most part. Â• congress has dealt with them responsibly and deliberately. with appropriate consideration being given to their findings and recommendations in the legislative committees. the action we are being asked to take may well deter responsible citizens from serving on such groups in the future. it is highly regrettable. therefore. that this most recent presidential commission report is being given such short shrift. particularly when there are recommendations that deserve some attention. i refer. for example. to the commissions proposal that states and local governments adopt legislation to protect young people from porraphic material. its recommendation to prohibit public. displays of offensive material and its emphasis on the need for cooperation between the family. church. school. and other segments of society in dealing with this problem. . as a parent and grandparent. i share fully the concern of. every mother and " father over the filthy trafficin obscene nmaterial. that is why in the 87th. the 88th. and the 89th. and 90th congresses i joined snator mundt in cosponsoring legislation to establish a broadly representative commission to look into all aspects of porraphy. thatis why i have consistently supported efforts in the senate during the past several years to crack down on smut peddlers and why i voted last june for senator goldwaters amendment providing greater protection for individuals and families against purveyors of filth. that is also why i voted 3 weeks ago for sefiator mansnelds bill to further protect an individuals privacy and to place greater restrictions on sexually oriented advertising. while i may strongly disagree with some of the findings of the presidential commission report we have just received. i believe just as strongly that it deserves a fairer hearing than it is getting today.
