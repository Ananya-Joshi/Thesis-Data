manufacturers will see their market access increased as global tariffs are slashed by onethird (or $744 billion). and many of these tariff cuts come in areas in which the u.s. is particularly competitivesuch as scientific and medical equipment.. chemicals. and electric machinery. u.s. service providersand here i mean telecommunications. financial services. and professional serviceswill reap new benefits from the round. rules regarding serviceÂ§ are set forth in the agreements. and these will serve as a framework for further liberalization. clearly. more remains to be done in the area of services. as  all the u.s. negotiating objectives were achieved. but as the presidents advisory committee on trade policy and. negotiations ed. the new agreement is an important achievement because it includes services in the world trading system for the first time and has resulted in some substantial market access offers. moreover. the services agreemenf itself provides for continued negotiation in basic telecommunications. financial services. and maritime transport. intellectual propertysuch as computer software. film. television programs. pharmaceutical formulas. semiconductor and jewelry designsall of these product areas where the -u.s. stands virtually unrivalled will gain new protections under the intellectual property agreement. how will the uruguay round affect our ecoy overall. we will see more trade. more salesand more wellpaying jobs. our products will be sold more easily and less expensively all over the world. the gatt secretariat has projected that the uruguay round agreements will add some $127 billion annually to the u.s. ecoy. our own council of ecoic advisors has estimated that the uruguay round. once implemented. will add from $100200 billion to the u:s. ecoy each year. i think these pheenal figures speak for themselves.
i can help but recall the television footage lately which showed the appearance of these 24 bankers before. i believe. the house committee. the question was asked as to who would participate in a loan to lockheed without the government guarantee. and there was a dead silence. without the twitch of a finger. then when the question was asked. "who will participate in the loan as long as the government guarantees it." 24 hands shot up in the air. i just wonder what the missing ingredient is here. because there seems to be a reticence to participate in the loan without the government. in essence. is  what we are saying that the american taxpayer is the one expected to bear the added risk. never mind us in the senate. we do  represent anything but the people of this country. so they have been asked to assume a risk which the 24 largest banks in the united states will  assume. is that  correct.
madam president. i rise in support of h.r. 3075. a bill to amend the small business act to establish a computer security and education program. i want to thank my colleague from the state of massachusetts. senator tsos. for his leadership on this bill. the increased use and reliance on computer techogy by the business community has provided expanded opportunities for abuse of computer systems for criminal purposes. according to one expert on computer crime. only 1 of the estimated 200.000 computer crimes committed each year is likely to be prosecuted. h.r. 3075 is an inexpensive commonsense response to the growing problem of computer crime against small business. the purpose of h.r. 3075 is the prevention of computer crime through education. many small businesses have yet to learn how to use computers effectively. how to protect their information. and how to safeguard their computers from accidental or deliberate misuse. the establishment of a small business computer security and education program by the sba will result in the provision of needed education. training. and information on these issues to a rapidly expanding audience of small business computer users. with the assistance of an advisory council. the sba will be able to make full use of expertise in other federal agencies and the private sector to provide an expanded management assistance program to small businesses. h.r. 3075 permits the small business administration for the first time to utilize profitmaking organizations to provide counseling. training. and otier types of management assistance. this authority was requested by the administration and was incorporated by amendment to h.r. 3075 from a bill i introduced last may. according to the sba. this new authority to develop training programs with the private sector will more than triple the agencys training capacity at increase in government cost. h.r. 3075 as amended by the senate committee on small business reflects the recommendations made by the administration. computer security experts. and small business representatives. i fully support this bill and urge adoption of this legislation.
mt. president. i rise today to pay a parting tribute to senator paul tsongas. who will retire at the end of this congress. to be perfectly frank. having stood shoulder to shoulder with senator ed brooke on so many an issue. i was  disposed to welcome with open arms the man who retired him in 1978. but the past 6 years have taught me to admire and respect paul tsongas. for his deeplyfelt compassion toward the underprivileged and for his coolheaded. reasoned approach to policymaking. when senator tsongas came to washington he brought with him a unique set of experiences that enabled him to make the most of his time here. drawing on his experience as a peace corps volunteer in ethiopia. senator tsongas soon distinguished himself on the foreign relations committee as a forceful advocate for humanitarian assistance. rather than military aid. as the best means for furthering democratic prinicples abroad. over the years. he has fought against the apartheid policies of the south african government and defended the rights of soviet jews to worship in their homeland or emigrate to aher. the son of an emigrant to this country. paul tsongas learned growing up in lowell. ma. that while it was possible for some americans to pull themselves "p by their bootstraps. there would always be others who need a helping hand. as a senator. he has voted to restore federal funds and programs for those who depend on them while at the same time seeking to eliminate water and redtape. paul tsongas is also the son of a small businessman and that has helped make him an eager and effective member of the small business committee. which i chair. as the ranking democrat on the productivity and competition subcommittee. he has shown great thoughtfulness and care in considering and creating legislation to enhance the governments progsams for small firms. increase access to capital and new techogies. and generally cultivate entrepeneurship in the united states. senator tsongas work is particularly apparent in two existing laws. he was both an original cosponsor of the small business iation development act and a skillful proponent when it faced significant opposition 2 years ago. the junior senator from massachusetts also championed the cause of computer security in this session. and the result was.the small business computer security and education act. which became law last july. computer crime costs businesses millions of dollars each year and senator tsongas has helped ensure that we assist those most vulnerable to this sort of thieverythe small entrepen-. eurs. . we will very much miss paul tsos participation on the small business committee. just as this body will be diminished by his absence. whatever the issuebe it the environment. energy independence. or the equal rights amendmenthe has spoken from the heart and voted his conscience. because he takes his responsibilities as husband and father as seriously as he has his senatorial duties. paul tsongas has decided to retire. im sure i speak for all my colleagues when i congratulate him on keeping his priorities straight and wishing him only the best in the future.

. i propose the amendment of h.r. 7737 to state that a minimum of 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the corporation for public broadcasting shall be allocated to the public television stations across the country in the form of unrestricted direct grants for station operations. there are some 180 public television stations in operation. in most cases. the local station in your district does  have sufficient operating funds to perform the service which it should for your constituents. for example. the public television station in my district has just been forced to reduce its operating staff by 25 percent because of lack of funds. the amount which would be available to these stations under the percentage formula which i urge would increase the direct allocation to each station from the $10.000 of the past year to approximately $50.000. my amendment would guarantee that a substantial part of the corporation for public broadcasting funds will help alleviate that problem. it would  preempt the administrative authority of the corporation. for the corporation would still have complete control over the other 50 percent of the funds. and. in addition. the corporation would decide on the manner of distribution of the funds that go to the station as direct unrestricted grants. as all of you k. your local station has struggled and is still struggling financially. there is little hope of any breakthrough unless substantial unrestricted funds are made available through the corporation. we should provide the mechanism that insures this. and we have the opportunity in this amendment. a national program service is important. but the local stations have an equally importantif  more importantrole to play in providing locally originated programs for the area they serve. without a great increase in federal aid. local program production will continue to be marginal. if it exists at all. while a certain amount of the corporations funds did get to the local stations last year. much of it was the result of the local station submitting a specific proposal for a program project. and then the decision to make the grant was made by someone at cpb in new york or washington. under the present arrangement. the cpb can dictate that local stations must produce an opera if they wish a certain allocation of cpb funds. or. on the other hand. there is programing of a "national youth show" instead of allocations which would make possible youth programs at the local level. more and more. under existing circumstances. our local public television stations are mere pipelines for cpb policy. i believe that it is imperative that the local stations maintain complete autoy in what they produce locally. at the same time. they should continue to qualify for federal aid. i ask for your support for this amendment which will insure that substantial funds are made available to the station in your district for its local operations.
 made it clear that he would  approve legislation providing longrange financing if that legislation failed to place adequate emphasis on localism. since the individual local stations are closest to the communities they serve. i agree wholeheartedly that the individual stations should control the national public television system. and that is why i am both amazed and concerned by the action of the corporation for public broadcasting in assuming even greater centralized control over the system. in apparent violation of the limitations imposed by the public broadcasting act. control must and should remain in the hands of the stations and in mechanisms they establish and support to strengthen their capability to serve numerous and diverse communities. the future of public television must  become a partisan issue. for the principles at stake are of too great importance. we are concerned here with hing less than the free flow of information to the public and the free expression of ideas. while the intentions of the board members of the corporation for public broadcasting may be entirely hoable and praiseworthy in assuming control of the national distribution process for public television. it is clear that the corporation is overstepping the limitations imposed by the congress. at the same time. the corporation is setting a very dangerous precedent. for when one hand controls the federal funds and also controls distribution power for public television we will have in appearance and perhaps in fact a domestic government network. it would be unworthy of this great body to sit back and watch the promise of a free and independent public television system thwarted in the name of "safe" or "ifensive" programing.
exactly. someone calculated that 38 statutes would be effected. including security laws. antitrust laws. hot oil laws. the communications laws. and so forth. as a matter of fact. at page 62 of the record which all senators have before them there is a list of 28 statutes furnished by the attorney general. there is one correction which i should like to make in the statement of the senator from massachusetts. the amendment which was agreed to last night applied the jurytrial provision to all the statutes. rather than. as the senator said. only to the civilrights bill. if the amendment had applied only to the civilrights bill. i would  be offering the amendment.
 i say again. the senator from colorado is  bashful. and may interrupt me. the administration originally took the position that you had to have 50 state plans. and everything else became a satellite within that plan. and only in extreme emergency situations could you pierce that state veilto use the lawyers term. like the corporate veil.  the administrations position is that it is apparently willing to come some distance toward the majority. and it is  insisting that any direct local plans be barred absolutely unless they have a state plan as paramount. it is willing to accept local plans after there is a comprehensive state plan in being. that is all they ask for . i do think there is a fundamental difference in concept between the original positionwhich i introduced as the administrations billand their present position. as incorporated in senator dominicks amendment. which is the administration position today.
