i say to my good friend from south carolina that i do  understand how it is that he and some of his conferees here on the senate floor have managed to take the appropriations process and so convolute it that we can get any business done. if. indeed. the good senator from south carolina wants to change the laws of this nation as they apply to busing. as they apply to abortion. as they apply to prayer in schools. may i suggest that there is an appropriate procedure which has been used far hundreds of years. namely the authorizing process. legislation of that kind would come through his committee and could be brought up here. on the senate floor. to be voted on. but that is  done. apparently. that process and the constitutional amending process take too long for the senator from south carolina. so. instead. we shall go ahead and take the appropriations process. which is meant to deal with dollars general policy but d illarsand use it as a. vehicle to circumvent the constitution of the united states and to circumvent the regular legislative process. i say to the senator. i am delighted that he raised this issue. because i have  seen anything on the floor of the senate coining out of the senators committee relating to any of these matters. all of a sudden. it is a sort of ad hoc situation. where members of his committee come out here and try to slap this stuff on appropriations bills.
