. on march 5. the house passed the administrations interest equalization tax bill. on repeated occasions i have expressed my opposition to this bill and i expect to do so if the bill comes before the senate. i take this opportunity to call to the attention of the senate an editorial from the march 8 edition of the washington post which bears out a number of criticisms that have been leveled against this measure by myself and its many other opponents. and calls for the establishment of a capital issues committee. i support the establishment of such a committee as i believe it could do a far more effective job in dealing with the outflow of u.s. capital as it affects our balance of payments without jeopardizing the status of the united states as the premier capital market of the world. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point in my remarks the editorial from the washington post. entitled: "taxing foreign issues."
