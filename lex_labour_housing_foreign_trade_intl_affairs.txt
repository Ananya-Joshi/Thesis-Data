. on october 10. 1977. i had the opportunity to speak before the first southern forum under the auspices of the members council of the chamber of commerce of new orleans. in new orleans. la.. on a mounting protectionist fever in this country and its effect on the world ecoic system and a vital need for international action on loans and credits. in that speech. i sought to counter the simplistic arguments presented by protectionists about the regressive effect of international trade on the national ecoy to emphasize the effective laws we have on the books. in the last 5 months. i have presented my views on the future direction of the world ecoy on the floor of the senate. before the senate committee on banking. housing and urban affairs. and in questioning the witnesses who appeared before the foreign relations committee. during our hearings on authorization for the u.s. participation in the imf witteveen facility. in addition. i have discussed the matter before numerous public bodies. i am engaging in this debate to spur the responsible officials. business and labor leaders both in the united states and abroad. to develop the necessary ecoic. political. and diplomatic solutions to these problems. the situation. if unchecked. will have the gravest consequence for the free world. i found the members of the southern forum to be very concerned about the rising forces of protectionism in this country and well informed about the severe repercussions on u.s. trade that may result from our going protectionist in this country. i would like to share with my colleagues the speech that i presented before that distinguished body and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
