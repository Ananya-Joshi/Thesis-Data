. i was most pleased to learn yesterday of this administrations decision to close our consulate in rhodesia. i believe the secretary of state has taken a wise step in withdrawing americar. support for the breakaway miity regime of ian smith. the perpetuation of such system is  in the interests of world peace or of the people of rhodesia. our refusal to recognize this government is a clear indication of our commitment to justice and equality. and i commend secretary of state william p. rogers for unequivocally issuing a personal statement of our decision in this regard.
