again i want to say that this is  any criticism of the committee on banking and currency. for they have jurisdiction over this phase of it. but i insist that you and i and everyone in either body of this congress have a great moral responsibility  to let this food be destroyed or spoil. especially while people are hungry and can afford to buy the food. so we are  interfering with the mal trade channels in any way whatsoever. we are just presenting this as a solution to prevent the spoilage and other waste and loss of this food. we feel that the proposal we have presented at least makes a stride in the right direction. i am  sure that any of us would be justified necessarily in opposing this bill that is proposed this aftern. but i am inclined to think that in view of the amount of credit that is available stilland i may say that i have some real hope the committee on agriculture is going to give a hearing on these various proposals fairly soonthat we might put the horse before the cart by recommitting this bill to the committee on banking and currency temporarily for further study and to see what developments may appear in the near future. we may find some degree of order out of the whole picture and begin to eliminate the terrific cost to the taxpayers and also relieve hunger wherever hunger exists. i think every member of this body feels keenly that if we have an opportunity to pass on that type of a bill which will relieve the treasury and the taxpayers. on the one hand. and will assist in taking care of people who are hungry and can afford to buy these foods. then we will be taking most constructive and humane action. while there are a great many groups and individuals who are becoming more and more concerned every day as to what may happen to the gigantic supplies of food commodities held in storage by the commodity credit corporation. i want to mention one group particularly. it is the american council of voluntary agencies for foreign service. inc. the following are the member agencies: adventist relief agency of the general conference of seventhday adventists. american baptist relief. american bureau for medical aid to china. inc. american committee for .migrd scholars. writers and artists. inc. american committee of ose. inc. american federation of international institutes. inc. american friends service committee. inc.

united service for new americans. inc. united ukrainian american relief committee. inc. war relief services of the national catholic welfare conference. inc. world university service. young womens christian association. inc.-world emergency fund. certainly these representatives of millions of fine americans should be encouraged to continue their humanitarian work. it is my personal conviction that legislation in this field should extend to fellow americans who could use this food. but who are  able to purchase it. charges are made that while this increasingly difficult problem of constantly increasing food surpluses is recognized by practically everybody. practical suggestion has been offered which would be of assistance. i urge most sincerely that our committee on agriculture give the earliest possible consideration to h. r. 8117 and h. r. 8178 as practical suggestions. i want to include here the latest information i have found as to the quantities of certain of these food surpluses. as of december 31. 1953. the commodity credit corporation had on hand 448.239.917 bushels of wheat. 361.511.364 bushels of corn. 285.084.033 pounds of butter. 269.130.366 pounds of cheese. 465.540.630 pounds of dried milk. 3.094.883 pounds of honey. 1.751.173 bushels of oats. and 202.825 gallons of olive oil. the total carrying charges on storing those commodities from june 30. 1953. was $99.314.333.84. that was at the rate of $539.751.81 a day. i think we must assume that these charges have continued and undoubtedly are close to or beyond $103 million. of course. some of these charges will prove to be sound. especially in the carryover of wheat. corn. and oats. but it is equally clear that a very large portion is  unecoical. certainly. if used in paying transportation costs in clearing out these warehouses. thereby ending the continued drain on the ccc funds. this would be a useful result. by also ending the continuing threat of spoilage we would have aher good result. and by providing means of placing food in the hands of those who need it but can buy it. we would have brought about the best result of all. i hope our colleagues will consider these bills carefully in the light of all kn facts. i am confident that if this is done. the proposals will receive overwhelming. if  unanimous. approval. but every day lost in obtaining action means a loss to the taxpayers in unnecessary carrying charges of many thousands of dollars a day. and the possibility of spoilage certainly increases daily. the challenge of loss by deterioration and shrinkage has been one which has concerned me for years. i was  able to secure any satisfactory information as to its extent. although we all recall the reaction of the american people when good. wholesome potatoes were destroyed in large quantities. i am including here data from the ccc as to this. i recall that over a period of some years i was advised that i could  have this information because the ccc books were  set up to provide that. of course. they should have been so set up. but the ccc is to be commended for instituting this kind of book entries. and i am confident that it will help the ccc and congress in taking action to prevent the scandal of unnecessary spoilage. however. i must add that i consider a loss of this kind amounting to over $5 million in 5 months to call for prompt action to prevent its continuation. the report follows: commodity stabilization service. commodity credit corporationlosses resulting from sales of deteriorated commodities and inventory losses due to shrinkage and
