. the foreign relations committee has been holding hearings over the past several months on the war powers bills introduced by me and other senators. at my suggestion. prof. alexander bickel of the yale university law school was called as a witness on july 26. 1971. professor bickel is one of our nations best kn constitutional law authoritiesboth as a teacherscholar and as a practicing lawyer. most recently. professor bickel won aher laurel by successfully defending the new york times in the supreme court in the famous "pentagon papers" case. professor bickels appearance before the foreign relations committee was. in my judgment and the judgment of others of my colleagues. one of the most illuminating. helpful. and instructive sessions which the foreign relations committee has had on this historic subjectand these hearings have consistently been of outstanding quality. in commending professor bickels statement to my colleagues. i wish only to add that. in my judgment. the subsequent questioning and colloquy of and with professor bickel. by committee members surpassed even the high excellence of his prepared statement and i am sure that this portion of the hearings will be of especial interest to senators when the hearings are completed and printed. i ask unanimous consent that professor bickels prepared statement be printed in the record.
