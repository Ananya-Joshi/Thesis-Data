the senator from rhode island sits on this committee. who ks better than he. and he has just spoken. i like this program because it is dignified for the poor and it deals with the poor who are making an effort to support themselves. the secretary testified it does  extend to welfare clients. it extends to people who earn money. it does  put the poor in ghettos. it distributes them around with other people so they can learn to live like other people and aspire to be like other people. one of the vicious things about public housing is if they get somewhere in life they have to be moved out. here is an automatically adjusting answer: get somewhere in life. here you stay where you are. but you pay your rent. it seems to me that this is a program well worthy of trial and we should give it a break. my entire argument is dominated by the secretary who said. "you get into a situation where you have to do teenyweeny things." if senators are for this bill they should vote for it. do  make it a teenyweeny vote or a teenyweeny thing.
