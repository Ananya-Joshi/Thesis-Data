i refer the senator to page 268. according to the 1987 national acid precipitation assessment program. napap. interim assessments. based on the national surface water survey conducted by epa. 5 percent of the lakes in southern new england had ph levels less than 5.0. and an additional 5 percent at levels between 5.0 and 5.5. on and on it goes. the results for the adirondacks show even more damage. then they quote studies from ontario. it just seems pretty clear from this evidence that aquatic population survival is clearly dependent upon acidity. the vulnerability of lake regions to acidification is used to assess and predict damage to aquatic populations. it goes on and tells us what has happened to the black duck population and tells what has happened to fish and other aquatic speciessalamanders. frogs. just as an examplefrom the spring s melt. so something is going on out there. we have quotes from. if you will see on page 271. "future effects of longterm sulfur deposition on surface water chemistry in the theast and southern blue ridge province." there it is. we can put this off. we can wait and see. we can always wait and see. but here we have the administration. on its own. coming up with a 10millionton reduction. that was  us. that was them. we concurred with them. we. perhaps. could have gone with 12 or 8. but we went with 10 to have the horses in hatness together. it makes sense to me. and one can argue with red spruce. how much that constitutes. but if you continue on page 272 and 273. it tells what is happening in this country. the longer we wait. the greater the damage that is done. so i think it is time for some action. i have  even touched on the human health factors. and they go on on page 279. -
