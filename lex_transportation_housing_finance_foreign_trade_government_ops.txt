. i testified before the committee as to the need for providing relocation assistance for families and small businesses which would be displaced by the highway program. i am delighted that this has  finally been recognized in both the house bill and the senate bill. on pages 5 and 6 of the senate bill a provision is made for this purpose. i should like to ask the senator in charge of the bill a question in that regard. i e that the limitations which are to be provided for moving expenses for families and for moving expenses for small businesses. on page 6 of the bill. lines 1 to 3 inclusive. are the limits which are the old limits of the 1961 housing act. i succeeded. in the banking and currency committee. in having those limits raised to a small extent for families and to a substantial extent for small businesses. by having the $3.000 limitation removed and by making provision for all moving expenses. there is great interest in this subject on the part of small business. we should do partial justice. since these businesses can get anything as a result of loss of profits. the senator ks what that means. he. too. is a common man. as it were. in terms of direct experience. at least we should give to them everything we can in connection with the physical problem of moving fixtures. the destruction of fixtures. and so on. will the senator give me his rationale on that problem.
