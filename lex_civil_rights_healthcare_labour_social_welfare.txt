. if i could have the attention of the senator from massachusetts. may i say to the senator from new hampshire i think it is fair to say the committee on labor and public welfare and its health subcommittee will be attentive to the work of this commission. what is made by law can also be unmade by law. certainly there will be an adequate interval between the time the commission makes its recommendations and the promulgation of those recommendations in the binding way described by the senator from maryland. i would like to give assurance to the senator from new hampshire that that procedure will be followed. so that we can all have a good. hard look at what the commission recommends. rather than have it. in some plenary way. installed and established as a matter of law. our goal. if this bill should be passed. is to be sure. from the congressional point of view. that we are  locked in and have  given away our rights and privileges.
