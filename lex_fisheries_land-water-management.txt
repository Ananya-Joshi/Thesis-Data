. i urge my colleagues to support the committees amendment to s. 1567. i particularly want to stress the measures in that package that ensure adequate mitigation of wetland losses to water resource development projects. whats at stake here is the continued existence of our bottomland hardwood forests. these wetlands are one of this nations mqst productive and endangered ecosystems. about 80 percent of the bottomland hardwoods in the lower mississippi river valley have been destroyed. or 19 million acres of the original 24 million acres. over half this destruction has been in louisiana. with large amounts also in arkansas. and mississippi. federal flood control projects and small watershed projects have accelerated conversion of these wetlands to cropland. an estimated 2 percent of the remaining bottomland hardwood forests are lost each year. if we allow this destruction to continue unabated. we will virtually eliminate for all time one of our most valuable ecosystems. we are on the verge of extirpating from this continent  just a single species. but an entire. unique assemblage of plants and animals. our bottomland hardwood forests occupy the broad flood plains that flank many of the major rivers in the southeastern united states. the largest single area of bottomland hardwoods occurs in the lower mississippi river valley. the bottomland hardwood forests in this region are among the nations most important wetlands. theyare prime overwintering grounds for many th american ducks. including nearly all of our 4 million wood ducks and 2.5 million of the 3 million mallard ducks in the mississippi flyway. numerous fish and shellfish depend on the flooded hardwoods. for spawning and nursery grounds. bottomland hardwoods also play a vital role in reducing flooding problems by temporarily storing large quantities of water and by slowing the speed of flooding waters. in the process. these wetlands remove chemicals from the water such as fertilizers and trap soil eroding from nearby farmland. the committees amendment would require the corps of engineers to mitv gate loses of bottomland hardwoods from water resource development projects inkind. what that means is that the destruction or degradation of bottomland hardwoods must be offset by the protection or management of other bottomland hardwoods. it does  mean that we offset destruction of this endangered ecosystem with protection or management of other less valuable and less scarce ecosystems. we simply can afford to allow the destruction of 100.000 acres per" year or more of bottomland hardwoods without adequate mitigation. the council on environmental quality has stated that: the bottomland hardwoods in the southeas are of such importance as wildlife habitats. and becoming so scarce. that the principle of full. inkind replacement should override other considerations. one particularly egregious example of the inadequacy of the corps present mitigation policy is the tennesseetombigbee waterway. this project alone has caused the net loss of 34.000 acres of bottomland hardwoods in mississippi and alabama. the corps mitigation plan failed to provide for replacement of these losses by protecting or managing other bottomland hardwood areas. as recommended by the u.s. fish and wildlife service. the corps report on the tenntom project even provided an option to mitigate losses with intensive wildlife management of national forest lands. which are intended to be managed on a multipleuse basis. in a review of this interagency disagreement. the council on environmental quality strongly recommended full replacement of the 34.000 acres lost. through a combination of management and acquisition of bottomland hardwood forests. the committees amendment would require mitigation of the loss of forested wetlands due to the tenntom project consistent with the councils recommendations for inkind replacement of bottomland hardwoods. the future of our waterfowl. of our fisheries and shellfisheries. and of our waters requires that we do less.

. on february 6 of this year. i introduced s. 777. a bill to designate 4.250 acres of the brigantine national wildlife refuge as a wilderness area. at that time. i emphasized that 4.250 acres was the minimum area of the wildlife refuge which should be given the additional protection as a wilderness area. i said i intended to consider the possibility of proposing additional areas of the refuge that could be appropriately designated as wilderness and that i would offer an amendment to s. 777 when that process had been completed. today i am offering. on behalf of senator williams and myself. an amendment to s. 777 to increase the area to be designated as wilderness under the bill. our amendment will designate a total of about 16.800 acres of the refuge as a wilderness area. this will result in all except about 4.000 acres of the present refuge being designated as a wilderness area. the principal area to be left as a wildlife refuge contains two artificial impoundments designed to provide habitat for common species of wildlife. this area clearly does  meet the criteria for wilderness because the impoundments represent the work of man. the impoundments should be maintained for future wildfowl management. there is sufficient space available in this area for an additional impoundment if this is deemed necessary in the future. s. 777 originally proposed wilderness status only for little beach island and a group of associated salt marsh islands each of the intercoastal waterway. there is unanimous agreement. i believe. that this area deserves the highest priority and that it represents the essential core of a wilderness area. the amendment we are offering today proposes designation of three additional areas--256 acres of the holgate peninsula. shad island. which lies just to the east of the intercoastal waterway. and the largest part of the refuge. the marshlands on the mainland. before offering this amendment. i reviewed carefully the reasons offered by the bureau of sports fisheries and wildlife for  including these additional areas in its proposal for designating only little beach island and its associated islands as wilderness. following are the bureaus comments about each of these areas and the reasons i believe they deserve designation as wilderness: first. holgate peninsula. the bureau pointed out that its ownership extends only to mean high tide with the state of new jersey owning riparian rights. the bureau said: thousands of people use the riparian lands for boating. swimming. sunbathing. fishing and beach buggy use. which eliminates any opportunity for solitude or wildernesstype recreation on this part of the refuge. further. there are unique ecological or geological features present on the peninsula. our plans are to retain this portion of the refuge in a natural state. thus achieving de facto wilderness status without official designation. it should be pointed out here that the wilderness act seeks to preserve areas that show substantial evidence of the presence of man but does  seek to preserve areas which can be used by man. the area between low and high tide on the holgate peninsula is widely used by the public for swimming. sunbathing. fishing and nature walks. access to the beach area is controlled by long beach township. which prohibits overnight camping. the only vehicles that are permitted to enter are beach buggies that can travel only in the wet sand area. further than 25 feet above mean high tide. the management of the area has sucsuccessfully protected the fragile sand dunes and beaches which are particularly valuable as a nesting area for skimmers and terns. the fact that the bird population of the peninsula has increased dramatically in the last 2 years demonstrates. i believe. that public use of the beaches has  been. and need  be. detrimental to administering the area as a wilderness. second. shad island. the bureau pointed out that shad island currently is an approved site for disposition of spoils dredged from the intracoastal waterway. the bureau said: continued use of these sites will help safeguard far more valuable estuarine habitat represented in potential alternatives spoiling sites. the bureau said: until the corps of engineers resumed dumping of dredge spoils on shad island this summer. the island was undergoing a process of natural succession which was eliminating the evidence of man. woody plants had taken hold and animal populations had found a favorable habitat there. the processes in operation there were the same as those changing all of mans works across the whole refuge. if shad island is protected. in a few years it will be hard to tell that men have touched it at all. rutgers. the state university of new jersey. currently is studying alternative means of disposing dredge spoils under a grant from the corps of engineers. all dredging of the intracoastal waterway has been stopped because a new new jersey state law prohibits dumping of dredge spoils on the marshlands which serve as dump sites in most locations. those conducting the study at rutgers have informed me that shad island. if it is protected at this time. would provide a valuable site for studying the effects of dumping dredge spoils. a study that could lead to beneficial uses of these spoils in the future. third. the mainland marshlands. west of the intracoastal waterway. the bureau pointed out that "literally hundreds of miles of mosquito ditches lace the marshes." the bureau said it had encouraged maintenance of the system of ditches as a means of biological control. further. the bureau said adjacent refuge estuarine areas are relentlessly being exploited and destroyed by man. it pointed out that this made the marshlands an increasingly important habitat for wildlife and that future demands for this type of habitat might require additional impoundments like those already established at the refuge. ditching as part of a mosquito control program has been carried out on the marshland of the refuge even before it was designated as a refuge. ditching began as far back as the late 1920s. according to the atlantic county mosquito extermination commission. at one time or aher. the ditching has been carried out on almost all parts of the refuge. including the 4.250 acres proposed by the bureau for designation as wilderness. the practice of ditching as a means of mosquito control has  been entirely successful and other means are being employed and sought to supplement this practice. the commissioner of the atlantic county mosquito extermination commission stated that mosquito control ditching has been carried out on the refuge south of oyster creek in over 20 years. this area. which is returning to its natural state. represents about threefourths of the land area of the refuge. there has been ditching on any of the refuge lands in the past 3 years and there has never been any ditching on about 1.800 acres th of oyster creek. the atlantic county mosquito extermination commission said it has  done any ditching on the refuge lands in the last 3 years because the bureau has refused permission for this work. cross sections of the ditches vary from less than 1 square foot to less than 4 square feet and the majority of them are the smaller size. they are observable only from the air. as i already have pointed out. my amendment would exclude from the wilderness area an area of about 4.000 acres which contains two existing impoundments and provides sufficient room for an additional impoundment if that is con.sidered necessary in the future. but it should also be pointed out that two of the most valued species of wildfowl. black ducks and atlantic brant. depend on natural estuarine habitat and impoundments would deprive these species of habitat. therefore. it is important that the existing marshlands be protected in their natural state for these species. in its comments on the mainland marshes. the bureau did  refer to the fact that two corridors. kn as oyster creek and motts creek landing. both contain residences. fishing enterprises and a restaurant. the corridors are very small parts of the surrounding tidal marshes but they do  meet the criteria for wilderness areas. therefore. my amendment proposes to exclude these corridors from the wilderness area. i am happy to have my colleague. senator williams. join me in offering this amendment. we have given careful consideration to the thoughts of the bureau of sports fisheries and those of concerned citizens. many of whom are represented by an amalgamation of citizens groups kn as the brigantine task force. it is my hope that my colleagues in the senate will be able to give this amendment favorable consideration in the near future. i ask unanimous consent that the amendment be printed in the record.
