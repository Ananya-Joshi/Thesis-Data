 once said.  do i share the fears of some of my colleagues about their causing regimentation. i do believe it best to develop and administer controls which will  result in the flight of goods from the markets as was the case with the artlessly administered meat controls in 1946. in any antiinflation program there should be a complete review and overhauling of the law providing support prices for agricultural products. in this congress there was appropriated for the aaa farmsupport program alone $265.500.000. and other large sums are being" utilized through the commodity credit corporation to support already very high farm prices. managementlabor cooperation is also essential in order to maintain the coordination between wages and the purchasing power of the dollar. those of us who believe that these are among the basic measures needed to curb inflation must  relent in our fight. the issue is  settled by any means.
