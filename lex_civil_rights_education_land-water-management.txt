i would like to say. before my distinguished friend from th carolina departs the floor that i. among others. have been waiting in the cloakroom. i was asked to wait while the distinguished senator had aher iinportant meeting.  i come to the floor and learn of the substitution of aher amendment which was  discussed. i really would like to get brought up to speed. the senator is well within his rights to do what he did. on the other hand. i was  on the floor when he asked to dispense with the quorum call and. as he ks. we usually try as best we canwe do  always succeedto iron out differences. which i thought is what we were in the process of doing. i am a little taken aback by a procedural event which is also substantive in nature.
