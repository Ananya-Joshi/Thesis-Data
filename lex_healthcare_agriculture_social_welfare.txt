. my colleagues on the agriculture committee deserve real credit for their hard work. indeed. there are provisions that i very much support: the environmental provisions. and the food stamp and nutrition provisions. but overall. this bill is  the real step forward in terms of making our farm programs and policies more sensible. i. therefore can support it.
