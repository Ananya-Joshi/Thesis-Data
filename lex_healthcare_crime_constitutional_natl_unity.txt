tradition said that the retarded and the disabled were put away in large institutions and forgotten. mainstreamthe word that we  hear in reference to these people who can share so much of the same life that the rest of us enjoywas never used. people used to say well. one of the manifestations of downs syndrome is that the child is fat and tongue is lolling out of his head. that has hing to do with downs syndrome. that has to do with the way society treats a downs syndrome child. if you were put into a corner and left there as a child. you would be fat. too. and if you had a part of your anatomy that needed particular strenthening and there was opportunity to do that. yes. then your tongue would loll out of your head. but i am telling you right  that has hing to do with downs syndrome. that is a symptom of the callousness of humanity. and yet. it was a tradition to take those of our society who were different and to put them off in a dark corner in a large building. i do  yearn to go back to those days either. as every day goes by in the united states. as every year that is added to the calendar. the process works and we become a more perfect nation. . there is necessity to punish ourselves by forgetting the precepts of the constitution as it relates to history. we are different from many other generations. indeed. how long has it been since we have really had to remind ourselves of the first amendment by virtue of any particular event here in the united states. in a dialog with my good friend from utah. i asked him when the persecution of the mormons took place. that was about 100 years ago. . we have m ci 14.1984 coo had prejudice. and i am sure that we have even had ij. / and death resulting from religious prejudice. but that probably was the last mass effort by americans to eradicate a particular religious sect. so really it has been 100 years since we have had religious persecution except for the more subtle ways individuals persecute individuals. but may i remind you. a lot of times i fall into the trap of saying that the first amendment was mainly written by virtue of our european experience. in other words. those who came over from europewhere religious persecution was rifewere determined  to see it repeated in the united states. i do say that. yet. it is  really accurate. that is  what truely precipitated the first amendment. the first amendment was precipitated by these people coming from europe to the united states. where they were fleeing religious persecution. but. state by state these people started to establish their own religions. connecticut was congregationalist. virginia was anglican. new hampshire was congregationalist. and so on. the first amendment was added to the constitution in response to the persecution that took place in the states. a persecution that was inflicted by those who had ironically been through the experience of being persecuted. so. if our forefathers could  remember the values upon which the united states was founded. i think we can all be excused if 100 years later if we. too. have done a little bit of forgetting. but the first amendment was devised principally by james madison. by thomas jefferson. and it all came to a head in the state just across the river. virginia. when a group of legislators proposed a bill which would impose a tax. the proceeds of which was to be used to pay the teachers of a christian religion in the virginia public school system. it was at that juncture that madison rose and delivered his eloquent statements about the need for protection against the very practices from which we had fled in europe. so i have doubt that if we permit the process to take its course insofar as our basic rights and freedom are concerned. we become more perfect. we come closer to the ideal as set forth in the constitution. and there will always be modifications along the way. it is never a straight path. i might add that i do  want to see many more modifications such as the one i read about the other day in the supreme court decision in the pawtucket case. i have criticism on that decision. because for me. what the supreme court renders is the law of the land. it is  the result that bothers me so much but. rather. how the court reached that result. because to reach that result. one of two things had to have happened. either the legal criteria had to change or my religion had to change. the court chose to change my religion.
