. i commend the distinguished majority leader. and chairman of the military construction appropriation subcommittee. for exercising his customary thoroughness in the preparation of this bill. in this. my first year on the appropriafions committee. it has been an education for me to serve as ranking member of this subcommittee and to benefit from the wisdom of the senior senator from montana. the subcommittee has gone into each of the projects for which funding was sought. considering the requests and weighing them against our overall defense needs. we have kept two basic considerations in mind: first. that we are reducing the size of our armed services and withdrawing many of our troops from overseas. and second. that we are in the process of moving to an allvolunteer armed force. thus. overseas construction has been carefully curtailed. while greater emphasis has been placed upon improving the housing recreational facilities. and operating capacity of our permanent u.s. bases. the total appropriation for military construction recommended by the committee is $2.002 million. of this. $432.9 million is for the army. $357.5 million for the navy. $292 million for the air force. and $14.8 million for the defense agencies. more than 40 percent of the bill is for military housingincluding $267 million for new construction. and nearly $130 million. i am very pleased to report. is for pollution control. the bill does  include money for the safeguard antiballistic missile program. which was incorporated this year in the military procurement bill. the legislation reported from the committee is $127.4 million below the budget request. and $10 million below the amount appropriated by the house. the committee has exercised the greatest care in considering these requests. and has approved only those programs which in our judgment could  be deferred. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
