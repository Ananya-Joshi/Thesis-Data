that report states that we shall attract capital into this country if we make american investments attractive by the conditions in our own country. that process is proceeding very actively. also more and more american companies can do their financing abroad for their own enterprises abroad. the interest equalization tax bill would exempt direct investments abroad. so we would  reach that area under the bill. other ways to improve our balance of payments are: expansion of our exports. and we are doing pretty well in that direction. as i have said. we have a $6.25 billion export surplus indicated for this year. also we have cut down very materially already in foreign procurement of military goods and expenditures of all kinds for american personnel abroad. we need to get very much more aid from our allies in terms of foreign aid. both military and ecoic. we are doing pretty well in the struggle which we are waging. but  as well as we should. the senator from ohio has referred to increased tourism. we are derelict in  expending the necessary amount of money to encourage more tourism to the united states. we can get more than a few million dollars from the congress. although it is understood that hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures for tourism are made by countries abroad. finally. our tourists spend abroad about $3 billion. there is limitation whatever upon spending by american tourists abroad. almost every country in the world has a limitation on spending by foreign tourists in the united states. those are some of the factors. there are many more. but those are some of the ways in which we could deal directly with our balanceofpayments problems so that the results would be infinitely more appreciable in terms of money and infinitely less damaging to the interests of the united states than the proposed equalization tax. the details which i have analyzed constitute one of the great reasons why i have so strongly opposed the tax.
