it seems to me that we certainly ought to show our confidence in the great proposal which the president has made and leave him untrammeled negotiating authority. king that we have full residual rights to approve a treaty or international agreement. what do i mean when i say it complicates it. it complicates it in a strange way against the interest of which the congress is solicitous. section 53. page 52. line 15. calls. for example. for a guaranty by the cooperating party that security safeguards and standards as set forth in the agreement for cooperation will be maintained. . it is doubtful that any such guaranty from the russiansand those are the people the president was talking about negotiating withwould be acceptable. because it is a paper guaranty. yet the russians might say to the president on the military international atomic pool. if he negotiated with them. that the cong:ess said that he could take a paper guaranty. it seems to me we should give the president full treaty authority in respect of the great proposal which he made to the world without tying it to something that has relation to it. which is our own relation with our allies on atomic energy like the british. and so forth. or regional organizations like nato. we take risks. we certainly strengthen the hands of the president and impose potency in the proposal he made to the free world. the historic significance of which i think we all appreciate. i hope the committee will accept this. it is one of the fine things we can do to strengthen the presidents hands  only  jeopardizing our own position but strengthening the position of the congress indeed. as mr. fultons amendment did a little while ago.
