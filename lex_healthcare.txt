. today i introduce the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act of 2001. together with chairman bob smith. senators harry reid. and barbara boxer. and other members of the environment and public works committee. i am reintroducing the popular bipartisan legislation that i coauthored in the 106th congress. that bill eventually amassed sixtysix cosponsors and i look forward to the bill enjoying the same strong bipartisan support it did last year. as the chairman of the senate superfund subcommittee. i have made brownfields reform my top environmental priority. as one of six former mayors in the senate. i understand the environmental. ecoic. and social benefits that can be realized in our communities from revitalizing brownfields. estimates show there to be between 450.000 and 600.000 brownfield sites in the united states. why do we have so many of these abandoned sites. the shift away from an industrialized ecoy. the migration of land use from. urban areas to suburban and rural areas. and our nations strict liability contamination statutes have all contributed. by enacting this legislation. we can recycle our nations contaminated land. reinvigorate our urban cores. stimulate ecoic development. revitalize blighted communities. abate environmental health risks. and reduce the pressure to develop pristine land. people may legitimately question the necessity of enacting federal brownfields legislation. given the frequent touting of brownfield success stories. is federal legislation necessary. the short answer is "yes". while many states have implemented inative and effective brownfield programs. they can remove the federal barriers to brownfield redevelopment. by providing federal funding. eliminating federal liability for developers. and reducing the role of the federal government at brownfield sites. we will allow state and local governments to improve upon what they are already doing well. i would like to briefly describe the highlights of our legislation. the bill authorizes $150 million per year to state and local governments to perform assessments and cleanup at brownfield sites. in addition. that money will allow epa to issue grants for cleanup of sites to be converted into parks or open space. it also authorizes $50 million per year to establish and enhance state brownfield programs. the bill clarifies that prospective purchasers. inent landowners. and contiguous property owners. that act appropriately. are  responsible for paying cleanup costs. finally. this legislation offers finality by precluding epa from taking an action at a site being addressed under a state cleanup program unless there is an "imminent and substantial endangerment" to public health or the environment. and additional work needs to be done. enactment of this legislation and the accompanying redevelopment will provide a building block for the revitalization of our communities. communities whose fortunes sank along with the decline of mills and factories will once again attract new residents and wellpaying jobs. we will bring vibrant industry back to the brownfield sites that currently host crime. mischief and contamination. there will be parks at sites that  contain more rubble than grass. city tax rolls will burgeon. schools will be invigorated. new homes will be built. and community character will be restored. this vision for our communities can be realized with enactment of this legislation. as with all legislation. we must reach across the aisle and work with bipartisan cooperation to be successful. the legislation we are introducing today garnered sixtysix bipartisan cosponsors in the 106th congress. it also enjoyed broad support from the real estate community. local government officials. state officials. business groups. and environmental groups. i hope that the bill will continue to attract such broad support in the 107th congress. i would like to thank chairman bob smith. and senators harry reid and barbara boxer for their leadership on this issue and their steadfast commitment to moviig this legislation forward. i look forward to working with all my colleagues and with the administration on this very important measure. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on finance be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. april 25. 2001. to hear testimony on medicare and ssi benefits: turning off the spigot to prisoners. fugitives. the deceased and other ineligibles.
madam president. i would like to remind the senate that october is  only breast cancer awareness month. but also the first anniversary of the enactment of the breast and cervical cancer treatment act. as we take time this month to remember all those whove lost their lives to this tragic disease. we must also celebrate the great strides weve made in diaging and treating breast cancer in women from all walks of life. as many of us remember. the centers for disease control has long operated a program to provide lowincome uninsured women with coverage for cancer screening. since its creation in 1990. the cdcs breast and cervical cancer early detection program has proved a great success. providing over one million mammograms to women 40 years or older through march 1999. of these. over 77.000 were found to be abmal and 5.830 cases of breast cancer were diaged. additionally. through march 1997. 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer were discovered in over 700.000 pap tests. despite this high rate of success. the early detection program contained a fatal flaw. the cdc program provided treatment options for lowincome. uninsured women who tested positive for breast or cervical cancer. instead of receiving the help they needed. the women diaged with cancer under this program were left to find treatment for themselves. unfortunately. early detection is pointless unless it is followed by immediate and vigorous treatment. to address this shortcoming. i joined with senators barbara mikulski. olympia se. and others to sponsor legislation to allow individual states the option of providing treatment through their state medicaid programs. as enacted. the breast and cervical cancer treatment act provides enhanced federal matching funds to states that choose to operate a treatment plan for women diaged under the cdc program. instead of imposing a new federal mandate. the bill offered positive incentives and tangible funding options to those states whose populations are most in need. today. on the 1year anniversary of the enactment of this momentous legislation. im proud to tell you that the act has been a great success. over the course of the past year. thirtythree states have already begun using the enhanced federal matching funds to provide treatment to women diaged with breast or cervical cancer through the cdc screening program. women across america are already benefiting from treatment program in these thirtythree states. i am especially proud to e that rhode island was one of the first to join. in fact. gover lincoln almond. his wife marilyn. and the director of rhode islands human services department. christine ferguson. were strong and tireless proponents of the breast and cervical cancer treatment act. by leading the charge for this bill at the state level. the gover and his human services director highlighted once again why rhode island has one of the best healthcare systems in the country.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller in introducing the childrens health improvement and. protection act of the childrens health improvement and protection act of 2002 will finally provide longterm stability to the state childrens health insurance program. while schip has been extremely successful at enrolling and insuring lowincome and uninsured children since its inception in 1997. the continued success of this program is in question. in fact. it is estimated that almost a million children will lose their schip coverage over the next three years if a legislative remedy is  signed into law to prevent this from happening. when schip was created by the balanced budget act of 1997. states were given their annual schip allotment based on the number of uninsured and lowincome children in each state. according to. the centers for medicare and medicaid services. these state allotments range from $3.5 million for vermont to $855 million for california. while the percentage of children without health insurance has declined over the past couple of years due to these allotments. the schip allotments for all states are 26 percent lower for fiscal years 2002. 2003. and 2004. each of these years results in a decline of $1 billion for state schip allotments. this phee is kn as the "chipdip." there was hidden policy agenda behind this steady decline in funding. it was based on a lack of federal funding for schip at the time this program was enacted. in addition. bba gave states only three years to rollover unexpended funds before these funds are given back to the federal treasury for redistribution to other states that have used up their entire allotments. according to the department of health and human services. a total of $3.2 billion in federal schip funds is scheduled to expire and revert to treasury over the next two years. these funding inadequacies  only create instability in the program. but they pose negative consequences for each state over the longhaul due to the uncertainty of federal commitment to schip. the likely result will be that states will either have to cap enrollment in their schip programs. push children out of their programs. or scale back benefits to make up for these budget shortfalls. the end result will be that children who once had access to health insurance will longer get the care they need. our bill will remedy these funding problems. it will do so by fixing the "chipdip" and by extending the life of expiring funds to states that need the assistance to take care of funding shortfalls. this legislation is crucial to my state of rhode island. without this legislative remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by fy 2004. at 4.5 percent. rhode island currently has the lowest uninsured rate of any state in. the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step in ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance.
. -it is with great ho that i recognize dr. vincent zecchiand his wife. julia. for the numerous contributions they have made to the field of medicine in rhode island and throughout the world. i am pleased to say that after a lifetime of achievement. rhode island hospital dedicated their newest. facility as the julia and vincent zecchipavilion on october 18. 2002. after graduating from the university of bologna medical school in 1936 and completing his internship at the long island college hospital in 1938. dr. zecchiserved his orthopedic and fracture residency at rhode island hospital. which he completed in 1940. subsequently. dr. zecchicontinued his medical training as a fellow at harvard medical school and as a resident at bostons children hospital and mass general until entering the united states army in 1942. dr. zecchiserved the united states in the china burmaindia theatre as chief of orthopedic surgery until his discharge as lieutenant colonel in 1946. upon completion of his military service. dr. zecchireturned to rhode island where he joined the orthopedic staff at rhode island hospital and miriam hospital and the faculty of brown medical school. during his illustrious career. dr. zecchialso served as chief of orthopedics at the veterans hospital. worked and taught at project hope medical schools in columbia" tunisia and sri lanka. and was a member of the tufts medical school faculty. dr. zecchihas authored and coauthored numerous articles in medical journals and textbooks. he was critically important in the development of knee prosthesis. and its instrumentation. and invented the doubleedged bone cutting "z" blade bone say. after such a long and distinguished .career. it is especially eworthy that dr. zecchifounded an orthopedic clinic for people in need after his retirement in 1982. throughout his medical career. dr. zecchihas benefited from the love. compassion and commitment of his wife. julia. who was in a nursetraining program when they met. together. dr. and mrs. zecchihave improved the lives of thousands of people and with the dedication of the julia and vincent zecchipavilion. future generations will continue to benefit from the zecchi goodwill. dedication and tireless effort to improve the world around them.*
. 3 weeks agoon a cold winter eveningseveral hundred people gathered at the station nightclub. a popular venue for live bands in west warwick. ri. they had come to spend time with friends and to listen to music. too quickly. this festive occasion turned to horror. a local television cameramanwho ironically was there to shoot footage for a news story on nightclub safetycaptured the scene in an extraordinary piece of video that will haunt rhode islanders for many years. a pyrotechnic display on stage ignited nearby soundproofing material. and the flames spread through the nightclub with shocking speed. by most estimates. it took only 2 minutes2 minutesfrom the moment that soundproofing caught fire. until the building was engulfed in flames and filled with superheated. toxic. black smoke. as this disaster unfolded. heroic emergency personnel rushed to the rescue. placing their own lives in jeopardy. eyewitness accounts described amazing acts of bravery at the scene. firefighters saved dozens of men and women. whom they pulled from the doorways and windows of the burning building. meanwhile. emts did their best to stabilize those who were gravely injured and worked with the police to help bring order to the prevailing chaos. rhode island is blessed with a network of fine hospitals. several of which have received national recognition for the quality of their care. on that night. medical teams provided the best treatment for the injured. many of whom have a long recovery. ahead. at rhode island hospitalwhich received 65 fire victims. nearly all at oncean entire floor was converted into a burn unit overnight. surgeons. nurses. technicians and other support staff must have been overwhelmed by the trauma. but they persevered. rhode islands new gover. don carcieri has been brilliant in managing the states response to this crisis. less than 2 months after taking office. gover carcleri has demonstrated remarkable leadership abilities in the aftermath of the fire. his efforts came at a critical time and helped ensure that every public official delivered a consistent. productive message. whether speaking to all rhode islanders at a televised press conference or visiting quietly with grieving families. gover carcieri has emerged as a strong. reassuring presence during a very difficult time for rhode island. he has expressed our anger at what when wrong. and our compassion for the victims and their loved ones. federal agencies also responded immediately to this emous tragedy. i am grateful for all of the assistance that rhode island has received thus far: from the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. the department of health and human services. and the small business administration. my family and i extend our heartfelt sympathy.to the families at this time of great sadness. i hope they will take some comfort in king that even with a population of more than 1 million people. rhode island is small egh that its citizens consider one aher as neighbors. that sense of closenessdeveloped over decades of shared experiences. both joyful and sorrowfulbinds us together and is part of what makes rhode island unique among the states. those connections are especially strongly felt in small towns and villages. such as potowomut. where my family has made its home for many years. potowomut is a closeknit community. somewhat isolated from the rest of the city of warwick and rhode islandon a peninsula that juts out into narragansett bay. sadly. a fellow potowomut resident. tracy king. was among those who perished in the fire. tracy was working at tile station nightclub on the night of the fire. and as least initially. managed to escape the blaze. once outside. however. he rushed back into the building to help others scramble to safety. tracy was a tall. powerful manalways bursting with energyand i am certain that he helped save some lives. i share in the heartbreak that all of tracys friends feel. king that he did  make it back out in time. in recent years. tracy had achieved a measure of fame in rhode island. as he had an unusual talent for balancing large. heavy objects on his chinchristmas trees. ladders. deskseven a refrigerator--all balanced perfectly on his chin. il 1993. he appeared on "the late show with david letterman." and balanced a 17foot ca. imagine thata 17foot ca. straight up in the air. tracy was a wonderful entertainer. and he especially enjoyed performing for groups of children. he generously shared his talent at local festivals. schools. and hospitalseveryone. delighted in seeing him in action. tracy king leaves behind his wife. evelyn. and three sonsjoshua. jacob. and jordan. i ask my colleagues to remember the king family in their prayers. we also remember that there are many other families in rhode island. and across the state line in massachusetts. that are still coping with this sudden. traumatic loss. in the days following the fire. survivors and family members of those who had died or been injured gathered together to mourn. to ask questions. and to share their stories. may they continue to draw strength from one aher. and be sustained by the enduring support of their community. the senate is considering this concurrent resolution recently approved in the house. cosponsored by my colleagues in the rhode island delegation. expressing the importance of improved fire safety in residential buildings in the aftermath of this tragic fire. i urge adoption of the resolution.
. i am pleased to be joined today by senator harry reid and others in introducing the breast cancer and environmental research act of 2003. this bill would establish research centers that would be the first in the nation to specifically study the environmental factors that may be related to the development of breast cancer. the lack of agreement within the scientific community and among breast cancer advocates on this question highlights the need for further study. it is generally believed that the environment plays some role in the development of breast cancer. but the extent of that role is  understood. the breast cancer and environmental research act of 2003 will enable us to conduct more conclusive and comprehensive research to determine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. before we can find the answers. we must determine the right questions we should be asking. while more research is being conducted into the relationship between breast cancer and the environment. there are still several issues that must be resolved to make this research more effective. they are as follows: there is kn cause of breast cancer. there is little agreement in the scientific community on how the environment affects breast cancer. while studies have been conducted on the links between environmental factors like pesticides. diet. and electromagnetic fields. consensus has been reached. there are other factors that have  yet been studied that could provide valuable information. while there is much speculation. it is clear that the relationship between environmental exposures and breast cancer is poorly understood. there are challenges in conducting environmental research. identifying linkages is difficult. laboratory experiments and cluster analyses. such as those in long island. new york. can reveal whether an environmental exposure increases a womans risk of breast cancer. epidemiological studies must be designed carefully. because environmental exposures are difficult to measure. coordination between the national institutes of health. nih. the national cancer institute. nci. and the national institute of environmental health sciences. niehs. needs to occur. nci and niehs are the two institutes in the nih that fund most of the research related to breast cancer and the environment. however. comprehensive information is  currently available. this legislation would establish eight centers of excellence to study these potential links. these "breast cancer environmental research centers" would provide for multidisciplinary research among basic. clinical. epidemiological and behavioral scientists interested in establishing outstanding. stateoftheart research programs addressing potential links between the environment and breast cancer. the niehs would award grants based on a competitive peerreview process. this legislation would require each center to collaborate with community organizations in the area. including those that represent women with breast cancer. the bill would authorize $30 million for the next five years for these grants. "genetics loads the gun. the environment pulls the trigger." as ken olden. the director of niehs. frequently says. many scientists believe that certain groups of women have genetic variations that may make them more susceptible to adverse environmental exposures. we need to step back and gather evidence before we come to conclusionsthat is the purpose of this bill. people are hungry for information. and there is a lot of inconclusive data out there. some of which has scientific merit whatsoever. we have the opportunity through this legislation to gather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research institutions across the nation. according to the american cancer society. each year 800 women in rhode island are diaged with breast cancer. and 200 women in my state will die of this terrible disease this year. we owe it to these women who are diaged with this lifethreatening disease to provide them with answers for the first time. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the record.
. earlier this week. i voted in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 11. the patients first act of 2003. my vote was  an endorsement of s. 11 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the billincluding the $250.000 cap on ecoic damagesand i anticipate supporting amendments to s. 11 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease practicing medicine altogether. for this reason. i voted for cloture on s. 11 in an effort to move the debate forward. i commend senator feinstein of california for working with themajority leader to craft a bipartisan proposal for reform. and i am hopeful that they will revive their discussions in the near future.
. today i will vote in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 2061. the healthy" mothers and healthy babies access to care act. my vote is  an endorsement of s. 2061 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the bill including the $250.000 cap on ecoic damages and i anticipate supporting. amendments to s. 2061 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease offering critical services. such as obstetrical care. for this reason. i will vote for cloture on s. 2061 in an effort to move the debate forward.
. earlier today i voted in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 2207. the pregnancy and trauma care access protection act. my vote was  an endorsement of s. 2207 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the billincluding the $250.000 cap on ecoic damagesand i anticipate supporting amendments to s. 2207 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpracticb premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or to cease offering critical services. such as obstetrical care. for this reason. i voted for cloture on s. 2207 in an effort to move the debate forward.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller and others today in introducing a bipartisan proposal to extend and redistribute expiring state childrens health insurance program (schip) funds. this legislation will allow states to retain $1.07 billion in funds originally allocated for fiscal years 1998. 1999. and 2000. and currently scheduled to revert to the federal treasury on september .30. 2004. the bill also applies a 7030 redistribution formula to the 19982000 allotments. states with surplus funds scheduled to revert. in september will keep 30 percent of the money and cede 70 percent to states that have exhausted their allotments. additionally. the bill will continue the current law redistribution rules through 2007. it allows states unable to spend all of their fiscal year 2002. 2003. and 2004 schip allotments within the 3year limit. to keep half of the unspent funds. the other 50 percent would be redistributed to states that have exhausted their allotments. this. proposal will prevent states from losing unexpended schip allotments and allows states like rhode island. with efficient programs and a highlevel of need. to receive redistributed money. without this proposal. the overwhelming success of state schip programs and quality health coverage to millions of uninsured children will be jeopardized. preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that more than 200.000 children will  lose their health insurance coverage between  and 2007. at a time when our nations uninsured rate has climbed to 43.6 million. it makes little sense to take away federal funding from states that are desperately trying to enroll needy children. this legislation is crucial to many states including my state of rhode island. without this remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by 2005. at 5 percent. rhode island currently has the third lowest uninsured rate of any state in the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step toward ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance. by mr. grassley (for himself and mr. coleman):
. congress and the public. like many of our nations govers. i agree that the medicaid program needs a careful assessment with an eye toward reform that will make the program financially sustainable. at the same time. i recognize the importance of  fundamentally altering the structure of program without the deliberation necessary to preserve aspects of the program that are working. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting senator smiths .legislation to help bring medicaid into the 21st century with reforms driven by efficacy. and  simply the cost of the program.
. this month we observe national breast cancer awareness month. and reflect on a disease that has touched countless american lives. there are more than 3 million women living with breast cancer in the united states and tens of thousands of women die from breast cancer each year. breast cancer is  the second leading cause of cancer deaths in american women. while important advances have been made. the causes of this disease and the means to prevent it are still unkn. scientific evidence about what aspects of the environment play a role in the initiation and development of breast cancer also remains scarce. although it is generally believed that there is a correlation between environmental factors and the prevalence of breast cancer. the extent of the environments role is  well understood. given the clear need to explore the potential relationship between the environment and breast cancer. i have introduced s. 757. the breast cancer and environmental research act. this bill would authorize $30 million per year for 5 years for the national institute of environmental health sciences. niehs. to award grants to study the relationship between environmental factors and breast cancer. under a competitive. peerreviewed grant making process. the director of niehs would award grants for the development and operation of up to eight centers for the purpose of conducting multidisciplinary research. the bill would seek to foster community collaboration between the research centers. patients. and the patient advocacy organizations. the targeted research proposed in s. 757 holds the promise for a better understanding of the causes of breast cancer. breakthroughs in prevention and treatment. and ultimately a cure. for this reason. i urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring s. 757 so that we may work together toward senate passage this year.
s budget request for va medical services assumes an added $795 million in revenues. but it does this .by more than doubling copays and instituting a $250 enrollment fee for certain categories of veterans. the cost of $795 million then is shifted from the government to veterans themselves.  only would many veterans have to pay higher fees under the presi.dents proposals. but those who could  afford the fees would have choice but to abandon va healthcare altogether. especially in a time of war. a policy that leads to increased denial of service to veterans is simply unacceptable. battlefield medicine has made huge strides in the last few decades. the result has been a much higher percentage of wounded soldiers living through their initial injuries. able to return home to their families. these wonderful advances in nedicine deserve and receive our praise. but they mean that the va will be caring for more and more injured soldiers as they return home. and many of these injuries. such as burns. amputations. and blindness. are of the type that will require care for a lifetime. the united states owes these injured soldiers this care. and thus the funds to provide it should  come from other veterans. senator burns amendment will address these problems by adding $795 million to the va budget -in order to eliminat6 the higher copays and enrollment fees. furthermore. it adds aher $28 million to compensate for cuts in va medical r&d. i will proudly cast my vote for this veterans healthcare funding measure. and i urge my colleagues to do the same.
 and chief executive officer. in all of these capacities. dr. baute fought tirelessly to further the scope and quality of care provided by kent hospital. and successfully brought new services and modern treatments to the community. while holding himself and his §taff to the highest standards of quality. safety. and patient satisfaction. his support for the creation of the care new englandhealth care system was instrumental in its success. and his lifelong pursuit of quality. affordable. and accessible health care services has been hing short of remarkable. i join with all rhode islanders in expressing gratitude for dr. bautes efforts to advance the scope and quality of medical treatment in our state. and i congratulate him for the many achievements in his outstanding career s2308 cor
. today i voted in favor of invoking cloture on s. 22. the medical care access protection act of 2006. and s. 23. the healthy mothers and healthy babies access to care act. i have concerns about various aspects of the legislation including the specific levels of the proposed damage caps. however. i do believe that reform of the medical malpractice system should be considered by the senate to discourage frivolous lawsuits and to ensure that individuals are able to access affordable health care. for these reasons. i voted to invoke cloture on both of these bills in an effort to move this important debate forward.
. i am pleased to commend the finance committee and senators hatch and rockefeller for holding a hearing on the state childrens health insurance program. schip. this program has meant a decade of health care coverage for millions of lowincome children who would otherwise be uninsured. my interest and commitment to the success of the schip program goes back to its inception. my father. the late senator john h. chafee. along with senator rockefeller. designed and introduced s. 674. the childrens health insurance provides security. chips. act on april 30. 1997. with help from a bipartisan coalition of members. including senators hatch and kennedy. this effort came to fruition later that year when congress approved the state childrens health insurance program. schip. when schip was introduced there were 10 million uninsured children in the united states including 3 million who were eligible for medicaid but were  enrolled. the schip program sought to alleviatethis unmet need by offering states additional federal funds if they provided medicaid coverage to children from families whose income was under 150 percent of the federal poverty level. this would mean coverage for a family of four earning $30.000 per year. the bill also provided grant funds for states to reach out and enroll eligible children. although some states were slow to implement their programs. to date all 50 states. the district of columbia. and the 5 territories have schip programs in operation. the schip program has been a tremendous success. the share of uninsured children has dropped from 23 percent to 15 percent of the population since 1997. today. more than 4 million lowincome children who would otherwise be uninsured have access to doctors. immunizations. and preventative health care through schip. since 1997. enrollment has steadily increased to the point that 6.2 million children are currently covered. rhode islands program has also been a success story. since the program began on october 1. 1997. that state has enrolled 25.573 uninsured children. the state has also expanded its income eligibility requirement to cover additional lowincome families. one reason for this great success is the schip programs flexibility in benefit structure and design. states are allowed to expand eligibility levels. cover parents of children on schip. and in some cases childless adults. rhode island has utilized this flexibility to develop inative strategies to address its uninsured. one example of this ination was rhode islands recognition of the importance of covering families. studies cited by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured show that parents are more likely to enroll their children in schip if the entire family is covered. parents who have the proper health care coverage are more likely to stay healthy and avoid missed days at work. the same is true of their children. preventative screenings and immunizations will allow them to remain healthy. avoid expensive hospitalizations. and stay in school. states may appeal to the secretary of health and human services for waivers to expand their program beyond current law requirements. along with 15 other states. rhode island has a waiver that allows it to use scrip funds to cope with the growing number of uninsured. states- such as arizona. idaho. oregon. minnesota. new mexico. and virginia have similar waivers. we have a growing crisis with the number of uninsured in this country. estimates place the number of uninsured at 45 million. up from 41 million a few years ago. we should reward states that use inative approaches with their schip programs to expand coverage. until comprehensive solutions are found to help states fill the coverage gaps. we should  penalize them for taking advantage of existing resources and programs. to this end. i have been proud to support legislation that maintained funding for the schip program and reallocated funding to coverageexpanding states. in 2003 i was the lead republican on legislation introduced by senator rockefeller to keep $2.7 billion in the program until the end of fiscal year 2004 and reallocate funds to other states through fiscal year 2005. this bill also included a provision i fought for that is important to states like rhode island. it allows states with expansive medicaid programs that covered uninsured children prior to schips enactment to use 20 percent of schip funds to cover these children. this is significant since schip provides a higher federal match than medicaid. states that did the right thing by covering preschip children were .being penalized by  receiving the higher match. in closing. i thank senators rockefeller and hatch for holding a hearing.on schip and hoing its tremendous accomplishments over the past 10 years. the schip program has been an integral part of our health care safety net. as we turn to reauthorization and the challenges facing the program in fiscal year 2007. i look forward to working with the bipartisan coalition whose vision created the program. we must work together to keep schip strong so that the progress and the inations made with the program will  be lost.
. i rise today to speak about a disease that has touched many american families. breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among american women. more women are living with breast cancer than any other cancer. three million women are living with breast cancer in the united states. 2 million of which have been diaged and 1 million who dont k they have the disease. over 40.000 women will have died from breast cancer this year alone. it is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women between the ages of 20 and 59. what is the senate doing about breast cancer. some of you may k that i have a bill. s. 757. the breast cancer and environmental research act. this bill was first introduced on march .23. 2000. in the 106th congress. since that time. the bill has been introduced in the 107th congress. where it had 44 bipartisan cosponsors and was on the verge of being included in the womens health act of 2002 wfen negotiations broke down. in the 108th congress. the bill again had tremendous bipartisan support. with 60 cosponsors. but again we did  act on the bill. which brings me to the current situation in the 109th congress. the bill  has 66 bipartisan cosponsors in the senate and 255 cosponsors in the house. thanks to the support and leadership of chairman michael enzi of the help committee. this bill was reported unanimously by the committee on july 24. 2006. the bill was hotlined for floor consideration before the august recess. but it has  received senate passage. we as a senate are denying millions of american women diaged with breast cancer the answers that might lead to a better understanding and perhaps a cure to this disease. how can a bill with 66 cosponsors that was reported unanimously by the help committee  be taken up and approved by the senate. this bill provides a targeted strategy and a longterm research investment needed to explore the links between the environment and breast cancer i urge my colleagues to work with me to remove any obstacles and secure passage of the breast cancer and environmental research act
. today i introduce the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act of 2001. together with chairman bob smith. senators harry reid. and barbara boxer. and other members of the environment and public works committee. i am reintroducing the popular bipartisan legislation that i coauthored in the 106th congress. that bill eventually amassed sixtysix cosponsors and i look forward to the bill enjoying the same strong bipartisan support it did last year. as the chairman of the senate superfund subcommittee. i have made brownfields reform my top environmental priority. as one of six former mayors in the senate. i understand the environmental. ecoic. and social benefits that can be realized in our communities from revitalizing brownfields. estimates show there to be between 450.000 and 600.000 brownfield sites in the united states. why do we have so many of these abandoned sites. the shift away from an industrialized ecoy. the migration of land use from. urban areas to suburban and rural areas. and our nations strict liability contamination statutes have all contributed. by enacting this legislation. we can recycle our nations contaminated land. reinvigorate our urban cores. stimulate ecoic development. revitalize blighted communities. abate environmental health risks. and reduce the pressure to develop pristine land. people may legitimately question the necessity of enacting federal brownfields legislation. given the frequent touting of brownfield success stories. is federal legislation necessary. the short answer is "yes". while many states have implemented inative and effective brownfield programs. they can remove the federal barriers to brownfield redevelopment. by providing federal funding. eliminating federal liability for developers. and reducing the role of the federal government at brownfield sites. we will allow state and local governments to improve upon what they are already doing well. i would like to briefly describe the highlights of our legislation. the bill authorizes $150 million per year to state and local governments to perform assessments and cleanup at brownfield sites. in addition. that money will allow epa to issue grants for cleanup of sites to be converted into parks or open space. it also authorizes $50 million per year to establish and enhance state brownfield programs. the bill clarifies that prospective purchasers. inent landowners. and contiguous property owners. that act appropriately. are  responsible for paying cleanup costs. finally. this legislation offers finality by precluding epa from taking an action at a site being addressed under a state cleanup program unless there is an "imminent and substantial endangerment" to public health or the environment. and additional work needs to be done. enactment of this legislation and the accompanying redevelopment will provide a building block for the revitalization of our communities. communities whose fortunes sank along with the decline of mills and factories will once again attract new residents and wellpaying jobs. we will bring vibrant industry back to the brownfield sites that currently host crime. mischief and contamination. there will be parks at sites that  contain more rubble than grass. city tax rolls will burgeon. schools will be invigorated. new homes will be built. and community character will be restored. this vision for our communities can be realized with enactment of this legislation. as with all legislation. we must reach across the aisle and work with bipartisan cooperation to be successful. the legislation we are introducing today garnered sixtysix bipartisan cosponsors in the 106th congress. it also enjoyed broad support from the real estate community. local government officials. state officials. business groups. and environmental groups. i hope that the bill will continue to attract such broad support in the 107th congress. i would like to thank chairman bob smith. and senators harry reid and barbara boxer for their leadership on this issue and their steadfast commitment to moviig this legislation forward. i look forward to working with all my colleagues and with the administration on this very important measure. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on finance be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. april 25. 2001. to hear testimony on medicare and ssi benefits: turning off the spigot to prisoners. fugitives. the deceased and other ineligibles.
madam president. i would like to remind the senate that october is  only breast cancer awareness month. but also the first anniversary of the enactment of the breast and cervical cancer treatment act. as we take time this month to remember all those whove lost their lives to this tragic disease. we must also celebrate the great strides weve made in diaging and treating breast cancer in women from all walks of life. as many of us remember. the centers for disease control has long operated a program to provide lowincome uninsured women with coverage for cancer screening. since its creation in 1990. the cdcs breast and cervical cancer early detection program has proved a great success. providing over one million mammograms to women 40 years or older through march 1999. of these. over 77.000 were found to be abmal and 5.830 cases of breast cancer were diaged. additionally. through march 1997. 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer were discovered in over 700.000 pap tests. despite this high rate of success. the early detection program contained a fatal flaw. the cdc program provided treatment options for lowincome. uninsured women who tested positive for breast or cervical cancer. instead of receiving the help they needed. the women diaged with cancer under this program were left to find treatment for themselves. unfortunately. early detection is pointless unless it is followed by immediate and vigorous treatment. to address this shortcoming. i joined with senators barbara mikulski. olympia se. and others to sponsor legislation to allow individual states the option of providing treatment through their state medicaid programs. as enacted. the breast and cervical cancer treatment act provides enhanced federal matching funds to states that choose to operate a treatment plan for women diaged under the cdc program. instead of imposing a new federal mandate. the bill offered positive incentives and tangible funding options to those states whose populations are most in need. today. on the 1year anniversary of the enactment of this momentous legislation. im proud to tell you that the act has been a great success. over the course of the past year. thirtythree states have already begun using the enhanced federal matching funds to provide treatment to women diaged with breast or cervical cancer through the cdc screening program. women across america are already benefiting from treatment program in these thirtythree states. i am especially proud to e that rhode island was one of the first to join. in fact. gover lincoln almond. his wife marilyn. and the director of rhode islands human services department. christine ferguson. were strong and tireless proponents of the breast and cervical cancer treatment act. by leading the charge for this bill at the state level. the gover and his human services director highlighted once again why rhode island has one of the best healthcare systems in the country.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller in introducing the childrens health improvement and. protection act of the childrens health improvement and protection act of 2002 will finally provide longterm stability to the state childrens health insurance program. while schip has been extremely successful at enrolling and insuring lowincome and uninsured children since its inception in 1997. the continued success of this program is in question. in fact. it is estimated that almost a million children will lose their schip coverage over the next three years if a legislative remedy is  signed into law to prevent this from happening. when schip was created by the balanced budget act of 1997. states were given their annual schip allotment based on the number of uninsured and lowincome children in each state. according to. the centers for medicare and medicaid services. these state allotments range from $3.5 million for vermont to $855 million for california. while the percentage of children without health insurance has declined over the past couple of years due to these allotments. the schip allotments for all states are 26 percent lower for fiscal years 2002. 2003. and 2004. each of these years results in a decline of $1 billion for state schip allotments. this phee is kn as the "chipdip." there was hidden policy agenda behind this steady decline in funding. it was based on a lack of federal funding for schip at the time this program was enacted. in addition. bba gave states only three years to rollover unexpended funds before these funds are given back to the federal treasury for redistribution to other states that have used up their entire allotments. according to the department of health and human services. a total of $3.2 billion in federal schip funds is scheduled to expire and revert to treasury over the next two years. these funding inadequacies  only create instability in the program. but they pose negative consequences for each state over the longhaul due to the uncertainty of federal commitment to schip. the likely result will be that states will either have to cap enrollment in their schip programs. push children out of their programs. or scale back benefits to make up for these budget shortfalls. the end result will be that children who once had access to health insurance will longer get the care they need. our bill will remedy these funding problems. it will do so by fixing the "chipdip" and by extending the life of expiring funds to states that need the assistance to take care of funding shortfalls. this legislation is crucial to my state of rhode island. without this legislative remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by fy 2004. at 4.5 percent. rhode island currently has the lowest uninsured rate of any state in. the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step in ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance.
. -it is with great ho that i recognize dr. vincent zecchiand his wife. julia. for the numerous contributions they have made to the field of medicine in rhode island and throughout the world. i am pleased to say that after a lifetime of achievement. rhode island hospital dedicated their newest. facility as the julia and vincent zecchipavilion on october 18. 2002. after graduating from the university of bologna medical school in 1936 and completing his internship at the long island college hospital in 1938. dr. zecchiserved his orthopedic and fracture residency at rhode island hospital. which he completed in 1940. subsequently. dr. zecchicontinued his medical training as a fellow at harvard medical school and as a resident at bostons children hospital and mass general until entering the united states army in 1942. dr. zecchiserved the united states in the china burmaindia theatre as chief of orthopedic surgery until his discharge as lieutenant colonel in 1946. upon completion of his military service. dr. zecchireturned to rhode island where he joined the orthopedic staff at rhode island hospital and miriam hospital and the faculty of brown medical school. during his illustrious career. dr. zecchialso served as chief of orthopedics at the veterans hospital. worked and taught at project hope medical schools in columbia" tunisia and sri lanka. and was a member of the tufts medical school faculty. dr. zecchihas authored and coauthored numerous articles in medical journals and textbooks. he was critically important in the development of knee prosthesis. and its instrumentation. and invented the doubleedged bone cutting "z" blade bone say. after such a long and distinguished .career. it is especially eworthy that dr. zecchifounded an orthopedic clinic for people in need after his retirement in 1982. throughout his medical career. dr. zecchihas benefited from the love. compassion and commitment of his wife. julia. who was in a nursetraining program when they met. together. dr. and mrs. zecchihave improved the lives of thousands of people and with the dedication of the julia and vincent zecchipavilion. future generations will continue to benefit from the zecchi goodwill. dedication and tireless effort to improve the world around them.*
. 3 weeks agoon a cold winter eveningseveral hundred people gathered at the station nightclub. a popular venue for live bands in west warwick. ri. they had come to spend time with friends and to listen to music. too quickly. this festive occasion turned to horror. a local television cameramanwho ironically was there to shoot footage for a news story on nightclub safetycaptured the scene in an extraordinary piece of video that will haunt rhode islanders for many years. a pyrotechnic display on stage ignited nearby soundproofing material. and the flames spread through the nightclub with shocking speed. by most estimates. it took only 2 minutes2 minutesfrom the moment that soundproofing caught fire. until the building was engulfed in flames and filled with superheated. toxic. black smoke. as this disaster unfolded. heroic emergency personnel rushed to the rescue. placing their own lives in jeopardy. eyewitness accounts described amazing acts of bravery at the scene. firefighters saved dozens of men and women. whom they pulled from the doorways and windows of the burning building. meanwhile. emts did their best to stabilize those who were gravely injured and worked with the police to help bring order to the prevailing chaos. rhode island is blessed with a network of fine hospitals. several of which have received national recognition for the quality of their care. on that night. medical teams provided the best treatment for the injured. many of whom have a long recovery. ahead. at rhode island hospitalwhich received 65 fire victims. nearly all at oncean entire floor was converted into a burn unit overnight. surgeons. nurses. technicians and other support staff must have been overwhelmed by the trauma. but they persevered. rhode islands new gover. don carcieri has been brilliant in managing the states response to this crisis. less than 2 months after taking office. gover carcleri has demonstrated remarkable leadership abilities in the aftermath of the fire. his efforts came at a critical time and helped ensure that every public official delivered a consistent. productive message. whether speaking to all rhode islanders at a televised press conference or visiting quietly with grieving families. gover carcieri has emerged as a strong. reassuring presence during a very difficult time for rhode island. he has expressed our anger at what when wrong. and our compassion for the victims and their loved ones. federal agencies also responded immediately to this emous tragedy. i am grateful for all of the assistance that rhode island has received thus far: from the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. the department of health and human services. and the small business administration. my family and i extend our heartfelt sympathy.to the families at this time of great sadness. i hope they will take some comfort in king that even with a population of more than 1 million people. rhode island is small egh that its citizens consider one aher as neighbors. that sense of closenessdeveloped over decades of shared experiences. both joyful and sorrowfulbinds us together and is part of what makes rhode island unique among the states. those connections are especially strongly felt in small towns and villages. such as potowomut. where my family has made its home for many years. potowomut is a closeknit community. somewhat isolated from the rest of the city of warwick and rhode islandon a peninsula that juts out into narragansett bay. sadly. a fellow potowomut resident. tracy king. was among those who perished in the fire. tracy was working at tile station nightclub on the night of the fire. and as least initially. managed to escape the blaze. once outside. however. he rushed back into the building to help others scramble to safety. tracy was a tall. powerful manalways bursting with energyand i am certain that he helped save some lives. i share in the heartbreak that all of tracys friends feel. king that he did  make it back out in time. in recent years. tracy had achieved a measure of fame in rhode island. as he had an unusual talent for balancing large. heavy objects on his chinchristmas trees. ladders. deskseven a refrigerator--all balanced perfectly on his chin. il 1993. he appeared on "the late show with david letterman." and balanced a 17foot ca. imagine thata 17foot ca. straight up in the air. tracy was a wonderful entertainer. and he especially enjoyed performing for groups of children. he generously shared his talent at local festivals. schools. and hospitalseveryone. delighted in seeing him in action. tracy king leaves behind his wife. evelyn. and three sonsjoshua. jacob. and jordan. i ask my colleagues to remember the king family in their prayers. we also remember that there are many other families in rhode island. and across the state line in massachusetts. that are still coping with this sudden. traumatic loss. in the days following the fire. survivors and family members of those who had died or been injured gathered together to mourn. to ask questions. and to share their stories. may they continue to draw strength from one aher. and be sustained by the enduring support of their community. the senate is considering this concurrent resolution recently approved in the house. cosponsored by my colleagues in the rhode island delegation. expressing the importance of improved fire safety in residential buildings in the aftermath of this tragic fire. i urge adoption of the resolution.
. i am pleased to be joined today by senator harry reid and others in introducing the breast cancer and environmental research act of 2003. this bill would establish research centers that would be the first in the nation to specifically study the environmental factors that may be related to the development of breast cancer. the lack of agreement within the scientific community and among breast cancer advocates on this question highlights the need for further study. it is generally believed that the environment plays some role in the development of breast cancer. but the extent of that role is  understood. the breast cancer and environmental research act of 2003 will enable us to conduct more conclusive and comprehensive research to determine the impact of the environment on breast cancer. before we can find the answers. we must determine the right questions we should be asking. while more research is being conducted into the relationship between breast cancer and the environment. there are still several issues that must be resolved to make this research more effective. they are as follows: there is kn cause of breast cancer. there is little agreement in the scientific community on how the environment affects breast cancer. while studies have been conducted on the links between environmental factors like pesticides. diet. and electromagnetic fields. consensus has been reached. there are other factors that have  yet been studied that could provide valuable information. while there is much speculation. it is clear that the relationship between environmental exposures and breast cancer is poorly understood. there are challenges in conducting environmental research. identifying linkages is difficult. laboratory experiments and cluster analyses. such as those in long island. new york. can reveal whether an environmental exposure increases a womans risk of breast cancer. epidemiological studies must be designed carefully. because environmental exposures are difficult to measure. coordination between the national institutes of health. nih. the national cancer institute. nci. and the national institute of environmental health sciences. niehs. needs to occur. nci and niehs are the two institutes in the nih that fund most of the research related to breast cancer and the environment. however. comprehensive information is  currently available. this legislation would establish eight centers of excellence to study these potential links. these "breast cancer environmental research centers" would provide for multidisciplinary research among basic. clinical. epidemiological and behavioral scientists interested in establishing outstanding. stateoftheart research programs addressing potential links between the environment and breast cancer. the niehs would award grants based on a competitive peerreview process. this legislation would require each center to collaborate with community organizations in the area. including those that represent women with breast cancer. the bill would authorize $30 million for the next five years for these grants. "genetics loads the gun. the environment pulls the trigger." as ken olden. the director of niehs. frequently says. many scientists believe that certain groups of women have genetic variations that may make them more susceptible to adverse environmental exposures. we need to step back and gather evidence before we come to conclusionsthat is the purpose of this bill. people are hungry for information. and there is a lot of inconclusive data out there. some of which has scientific merit whatsoever. we have the opportunity through this legislation to gather legitimate and comprehensive data from premier research institutions across the nation. according to the american cancer society. each year 800 women in rhode island are diaged with breast cancer. and 200 women in my state will die of this terrible disease this year. we owe it to these women who are diaged with this lifethreatening disease to provide them with answers for the first time. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and cosponsoring this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the record.
. earlier this week. i voted in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 11. the patients first act of 2003. my vote was  an endorsement of s. 11 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the billincluding the $250.000 cap on ecoic damagesand i anticipate supporting amendments to s. 11 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease practicing medicine altogether. for this reason. i voted for cloture on s. 11 in an effort to move the debate forward. i commend senator feinstein of california for working with themajority leader to craft a bipartisan proposal for reform. and i am hopeful that they will revive their discussions in the near future.
. today i will vote in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 2061. the healthy" mothers and healthy babies access to care act. my vote is  an endorsement of s. 2061 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the bill including the $250.000 cap on ecoic damages and i anticipate supporting. amendments to s. 2061 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease offering critical services. such as obstetrical care. for this reason. i will vote for cloture on s. 2061 in an effort to move the debate forward.
. earlier today i voted in favor of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to s. 2207. the pregnancy and trauma care access protection act. my vote was  an endorsement of s. 2207 as it was introduced in the senate. in fact. i have concerns about various aspects of the billincluding the $250.000 cap on ecoic damagesand i anticipate supporting amendments to s. 2207 if the senate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation. however. i do believe that reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpracticb premiums that endanger americans access to quality medical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or to cease offering critical services. such as obstetrical care. for this reason. i voted for cloture on s. 2207 in an effort to move the debate forward.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller and others today in introducing a bipartisan proposal to extend and redistribute expiring state childrens health insurance program (schip) funds. this legislation will allow states to retain $1.07 billion in funds originally allocated for fiscal years 1998. 1999. and 2000. and currently scheduled to revert to the federal treasury on september .30. 2004. the bill also applies a 7030 redistribution formula to the 19982000 allotments. states with surplus funds scheduled to revert. in september will keep 30 percent of the money and cede 70 percent to states that have exhausted their allotments. additionally. the bill will continue the current law redistribution rules through 2007. it allows states unable to spend all of their fiscal year 2002. 2003. and 2004 schip allotments within the 3year limit. to keep half of the unspent funds. the other 50 percent would be redistributed to states that have exhausted their allotments. this. proposal will prevent states from losing unexpended schip allotments and allows states like rhode island. with efficient programs and a highlevel of need. to receive redistributed money. without this proposal. the overwhelming success of state schip programs and quality health coverage to millions of uninsured children will be jeopardized. preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that more than 200.000 children will  lose their health insurance coverage between  and 2007. at a time when our nations uninsured rate has climbed to 43.6 million. it makes little sense to take away federal funding from states that are desperately trying to enroll needy children. this legislation is crucial to many states including my state of rhode island. without this remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by 2005. at 5 percent. rhode island currently has the third lowest uninsured rate of any state in the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step toward ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance. by mr. grassley (for himself and mr. coleman):
. congress and the public. like many of our nations govers. i agree that the medicaid program needs a careful assessment with an eye toward reform that will make the program financially sustainable. at the same time. i recognize the importance of  fundamentally altering the structure of program without the deliberation necessary to preserve aspects of the program that are working. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting senator smiths .legislation to help bring medicaid into the 21st century with reforms driven by efficacy. and  simply the cost of the program.
. this month we observe national breast cancer awareness month. and reflect on a disease that has touched countless american lives. there are more than 3 million women living with breast cancer in the united states and tens of thousands of women die from breast cancer each year. breast cancer is  the second leading cause of cancer deaths in american women. while important advances have been made. the causes of this disease and the means to prevent it are still unkn. scientific evidence about what aspects of the environment play a role in the initiation and development of breast cancer also remains scarce. although it is generally believed that there is a correlation between environmental factors and the prevalence of breast cancer. the extent of the environments role is  well understood. given the clear need to explore the potential relationship between the environment and breast cancer. i have introduced s. 757. the breast cancer and environmental research act. this bill would authorize $30 million per year for 5 years for the national institute of environmental health sciences. niehs. to award grants to study the relationship between environmental factors and breast cancer. under a competitive. peerreviewed grant making process. the director of niehs would award grants for the development and operation of up to eight centers for the purpose of conducting multidisciplinary research. the bill would seek to foster community collaboration between the research centers. patients. and the patient advocacy organizations. the targeted research proposed in s. 757 holds the promise for a better understanding of the causes of breast cancer. breakthroughs in prevention and treatment. and ultimately a cure. for this reason. i urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring s. 757 so that we may work together toward senate passage this year.
s budget request for va medical services assumes an added $795 million in revenues. but it does this .by more than doubling copays and instituting a $250 enrollment fee for certain categories of veterans. the cost of $795 million then is shifted from the government to veterans themselves.  only would many veterans have to pay higher fees under the presi.dents proposals. but those who could  afford the fees would have choice but to abandon va healthcare altogether. especially in a time of war. a policy that leads to increased denial of service to veterans is simply unacceptable. battlefield medicine has made huge strides in the last few decades. the result has been a much higher percentage of wounded soldiers living through their initial injuries. able to return home to their families. these wonderful advances in nedicine deserve and receive our praise. but they mean that the va will be caring for more and more injured soldiers as they return home. and many of these injuries. such as burns. amputations. and blindness. are of the type that will require care for a lifetime. the united states owes these injured soldiers this care. and thus the funds to provide it should  come from other veterans. senator burns amendment will address these problems by adding $795 million to the va budget -in order to eliminat6 the higher copays and enrollment fees. furthermore. it adds aher $28 million to compensate for cuts in va medical r&d. i will proudly cast my vote for this veterans healthcare funding measure. and i urge my colleagues to do the same.
 and chief executive officer. in all of these capacities. dr. baute fought tirelessly to further the scope and quality of care provided by kent hospital. and successfully brought new services and modern treatments to the community. while holding himself and his §taff to the highest standards of quality. safety. and patient satisfaction. his support for the creation of the care new englandhealth care system was instrumental in its success. and his lifelong pursuit of quality. affordable. and accessible health care services has been hing short of remarkable. i join with all rhode islanders in expressing gratitude for dr. bautes efforts to advance the scope and quality of medical treatment in our state. and i congratulate him for the many achievements in his outstanding career s2308 cor
. today i voted in favor of invoking cloture on s. 22. the medical care access protection act of 2006. and s. 23. the healthy mothers and healthy babies access to care act. i have concerns about various aspects of the legislation including the specific levels of the proposed damage caps. however. i do believe that reform of the medical malpractice system should be considered by the senate to discourage frivolous lawsuits and to ensure that individuals are able to access affordable health care. for these reasons. i voted to invoke cloture on both of these bills in an effort to move this important debate forward.
. i am pleased to commend the finance committee and senators hatch and rockefeller for holding a hearing on the state childrens health insurance program. schip. this program has meant a decade of health care coverage for millions of lowincome children who would otherwise be uninsured. my interest and commitment to the success of the schip program goes back to its inception. my father. the late senator john h. chafee. along with senator rockefeller. designed and introduced s. 674. the childrens health insurance provides security. chips. act on april 30. 1997. with help from a bipartisan coalition of members. including senators hatch and kennedy. this effort came to fruition later that year when congress approved the state childrens health insurance program. schip. when schip was introduced there were 10 million uninsured children in the united states including 3 million who were eligible for medicaid but were  enrolled. the schip program sought to alleviatethis unmet need by offering states additional federal funds if they provided medicaid coverage to children from families whose income was under 150 percent of the federal poverty level. this would mean coverage for a family of four earning $30.000 per year. the bill also provided grant funds for states to reach out and enroll eligible children. although some states were slow to implement their programs. to date all 50 states. the district of columbia. and the 5 territories have schip programs in operation. the schip program has been a tremendous success. the share of uninsured children has dropped from 23 percent to 15 percent of the population since 1997. today. more than 4 million lowincome children who would otherwise be uninsured have access to doctors. immunizations. and preventative health care through schip. since 1997. enrollment has steadily increased to the point that 6.2 million children are currently covered. rhode islands program has also been a success story. since the program began on october 1. 1997. that state has enrolled 25.573 uninsured children. the state has also expanded its income eligibility requirement to cover additional lowincome families. one reason for this great success is the schip programs flexibility in benefit structure and design. states are allowed to expand eligibility levels. cover parents of children on schip. and in some cases childless adults. rhode island has utilized this flexibility to develop inative strategies to address its uninsured. one example of this ination was rhode islands recognition of the importance of covering families. studies cited by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured show that parents are more likely to enroll their children in schip if the entire family is covered. parents who have the proper health care coverage are more likely to stay healthy and avoid missed days at work. the same is true of their children. preventative screenings and immunizations will allow them to remain healthy. avoid expensive hospitalizations. and stay in school. states may appeal to the secretary of health and human services for waivers to expand their program beyond current law requirements. along with 15 other states. rhode island has a waiver that allows it to use scrip funds to cope with the growing number of uninsured. states- such as arizona. idaho. oregon. minnesota. new mexico. and virginia have similar waivers. we have a growing crisis with the number of uninsured in this country. estimates place the number of uninsured at 45 million. up from 41 million a few years ago. we should reward states that use inative approaches with their schip programs to expand coverage. until comprehensive solutions are found to help states fill the coverage gaps. we should  penalize them for taking advantage of existing resources and programs. to this end. i have been proud to support legislation that maintained funding for the schip program and reallocated funding to coverageexpanding states. in 2003 i was the lead republican on legislation introduced by senator rockefeller to keep $2.7 billion in the program until the end of fiscal year 2004 and reallocate funds to other states through fiscal year 2005. this bill also included a provision i fought for that is important to states like rhode island. it allows states with expansive medicaid programs that covered uninsured children prior to schips enactment to use 20 percent of schip funds to cover these children. this is significant since schip provides a higher federal match than medicaid. states that did the right thing by covering preschip children were .being penalized by  receiving the higher match. in closing. i thank senators rockefeller and hatch for holding a hearing.on schip and hoing its tremendous accomplishments over the past 10 years. the schip program has been an integral part of our health care safety net. as we turn to reauthorization and the challenges facing the program in fiscal year 2007. i look forward to working with the bipartisan coalition whose vision created the program. we must work together to keep schip strong so that the progress and the inations made with the program will  be lost.
. i rise today to speak about a disease that has touched many american families. breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among american women. more women are living with breast cancer than any other cancer. three million women are living with breast cancer in the united states. 2 million of which have been diaged and 1 million who dont k they have the disease. over 40.000 women will have died from breast cancer this year alone. it is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women between the ages of 20 and 59. what is the senate doing about breast cancer. some of you may k that i have a bill. s. 757. the breast cancer and environmental research act. this bill was first introduced on march .23. 2000. in the 106th congress. since that time. the bill has been introduced in the 107th congress. where it had 44 bipartisan cosponsors and was on the verge of being included in the womens health act of 2002 wfen negotiations broke down. in the 108th congress. the bill again had tremendous bipartisan support. with 60 cosponsors. but again we did  act on the bill. which brings me to the current situation in the 109th congress. the bill  has 66 bipartisan cosponsors in the senate and 255 cosponsors in the house. thanks to the support and leadership of chairman michael enzi of the help committee. this bill was reported unanimously by the committee on july 24. 2006. the bill was hotlined for floor consideration before the august recess. but it has  received senate passage. we as a senate are denying millions of american women diaged with breast cancer the answers that might lead to a better understanding and perhaps a cure to this disease. how can a bill with 66 cosponsors that was reported unanimously by the help committee  be taken up and approved by the senate. this bill provides a targeted strategy and a longterm research investment needed to explore the links between the environment and breast cancer i urge my colleagues to work with me to remove any obstacles and secure passage of the breast cancer and environmental research act
. last thursday. january 12. i introduced house joint resolution 131 which would establish a most fitting memorial to one of the greatest statesmen of our time. the late edith rse rogers. who served as a member of this body for over three decades. congresswoman rogers public service was distinguished by her constant devotion to the ideal of freedom. throughout her career. both in war and in peace. she was in the forefront of the struggle for human liberty and human dignity. but closest to her heart were the men and women who had served in defense of the republic. when it was threatened by the aggressive designs of those who would destroy mens freedom. her selflessness. in behalf of those who were disabled in the nations service. of the widows and orphans of those whose lives were given in the defense of our countryin fact. in behalf of all of our citizens who are privileged to defend our american heritage in time of war. is kn to americans everywhere. congresswoman rogers earned the respect and love of her fellow citizens in all walks of life. within the district that she represented with such dedication for 35 years there is a veterans administration hospital which mrs. rogers quietly visited whenever there were a few free moments in her demanding schedule. the hundreds of patients at the va hospital in bedford. mass.. knew her and loved her. she constantly fought to improve conditions at the bedford va hospital. as she did at va hospitals throughout the country. it may well be said that the bedford va hospital is a monument of the outstanding work congresswoman rogers did throughout the nation over the years to insure that care provided to our nations veterans was of the highest standards. to those of us who have lived in massachusetts. who have kn of mrs. rogers great work on behalf of veterans everywhere. the bedford va hospital has been mrs. rogers hospital. the resolution i offer would merely formalize that identification by renaming it the edith rse rogers memorial hospital. a number of veterans organizations have urged that the hospital in bedford be so designated. i can think of finer tribute to the memory of one of the greatest of americans. the resolution follows: h.j. res. 131 joint resolution to designate the veterans administration hospital at bedford. mass.. as the edrrih rse rogers memorial hospital. resolved. that the veterans administration hospital at bedford. mass.. shall be kn and designated hereafter as the "edith rse rogers memorial hospital." any law. regulation. map. document. record. or other paper of the united states in which such hospital is referred to shall be held to refer to such hospital as the "edrrh rse rogers memorial hospital."
 kennedy. so. in a real sense. this is a matter with total bipartisan and universal support. and the principle of this longrange program was approved by congress last year. 1 can assure you gentlemen that this longrange plan of the veterans administration was designed to bring order and precise planning to the mammoth problem of maintaining and replacing the physical plants and equipment of the va hospital systemthe largest hospital system in the united states. it permits sound planning. and it has designed into it a flexibility to cope with the shifting veteran population and medical needs. this plan represents the dedicated effort and creative thinking of hospital construction experts in and out of government. and it should  be impaired by curtailing the funds required to underwrite its successful installation. i speak in favor of this amendment from the strong personal conviction. based on my personal experience as a member of the va staff. that the program requested by that agency is soundly conceived and will result in an orderly and effective and vital hospital modernization and replacement program.
. during the period that i had the privilege of serving as deputy administrator of veterans affairs. i came to k and admire a great man. this man. dr. william s. middleton. was chief medical director of the vas department of medicine and surgery. citing his title tells you something of his position. but may actually be misleading about the man himself. for dr. middleton was austere medical administrator. sitting in an office high above the arena of mans pain and suffering. the symbol of dr. middleton was never the plush chair and the big desk. rather. his most treasured possession. one always physically close to him. was the stethoscope he carried for the 43 years he served the university of wisconsin medical school. including 22 years as dean. certainly during the time i was his associate in the veterans administration. dr. middleton was never happier than when touring the wards of a veterans hospital. combining his stethoscope. his magnificent brain. and his deep feeling for his fellow man in order to cure and to soothe. on the first of march. after 8 years as chief medical director. dr. middleton.  73. retired. behind him he leaves many friends. those who have kn him. and thoseperhaps never having heard his namewho have received better medical care as a result of his service. also retiring after 45 years of service to veterans is "senator" robinson e. "bob" adkins. who has been the principal administrative adviser and assistant to va chief medical directors since october 1945. bob was a close friend and confidant of dr. middleton. the two making an admirable working team. particularly since they agreed 100 percent that va medicine must  only continue its position in the first rank. but must never settle for less than a deep and genuine sympathy for each individual veteran.  as a patient or a case. but as a human being with a medical problem. that the department of medicine and surgery has succeeded and is succeeding in this endeavor is. in large measure. due to dr. william s. middleton and robinson e. adkins.
. it can be a source of pride to our nation that more than 5 million children and adults are the victims of mental retardation. this statistic is all the more tragic because it could be prevented. our kledge of the causes of mental retardation is imperfect. but medical science has already told us that many. many instances of retardation could be prevented by adequate medical care for the expectant mother and the newborn infant. the bill that is before us to assist states and communities in preventing and combating mental retardation is a long overdue extension of our present programs of maternal and child health services and crippled childrens services and would provide public health agencies with funds for the care of expectant mothers with conditions which increase the hazards of retardation. the research and planning projects contemplated by the bill will increase our kledge of the causes and cures for mental retardation and go far toward reducing the tragic cost in human talent and human happiness which the present rate of mental retardation represents. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 7544.
. there can be doubt that as a nation. we have  provided adequately for the prevention and treatment of mental health and mental retardation. this fact is graphically illustrated by aging. hazardous mental institutions. inadequate individual care. and the presence of almost 6 million children and adults in america whose ability to learn and adapt to society is seriously impaired. we have already passed legislation to extend federal assistance to state and communities through the maternal and child health programs. the legislation before us is aher indispensable part of our overall determination to prevent mental illness and mental retardation. to provide adequate care when it strikes. and to rehabilitate sufferers to a mal. productive life in their families and communities. this bill introduces a new concept in our treatment of victims of mental illness: community mental health centers. as obvious as it would seem that patients are more likely to respond to treatment in their own environments. surrounded by family and friends. too much of our effort in this field has involved isolated institutions where patients are  treated as those suffering from sickness and disease. but as strange. or peculiar people who must be kept from the rest of society. of course. we have made tremendous strides in our kledge and treatment of mental illness and mental retardation. but how far we have still to travel is indicated by the large number of victims. i hope that the house will approve this bill and take aher step in the direction of eliminating the tragic waste in human talent and human happiness which the present levels of mental illness represent.
. i was disturbed by the reduction in funds for alliance for progress loans and grants voted by the house. this cut. from $600 to $450 million in aids participation in the alliance. if sustained. will necessitate serious cutbacks in vital latin american projects. the alliance is a principal hope for peaceful development in latin america. dr. milton eisenhower. who was a special representative to latin america during the previous administration. has just pointed out in a very fine book. that revolution is inevitable. the only question is whether it will be peaceful or violent. needless to say. the united states has a tremendous stake in the peaceful development of our neighbors to the south. this will require large sums of money. and to cripple our effort . when the program is beginning to show results. is  in our best interests. for example. this cut may require the abandonment of a number of important health projects. expenditures for surplus food distribution. textbooks. and health clinics are  in jeopardy. in emphasizing the need for ecoic development we must remember that this can only be carried forward by a healthy population. it is staggering to realize that latin american nations have in some instances an infant mortality four times that of the united states and western europe. this statistic is. of course. preventable. it is false ecoy to permit this terrible drain to continue. where will we find the leaders of tomorrow if  among the children of today. new opportunities for development are opening up in latin america every day. we are encouraging private investment through our investment guarantee program. this investment can bear fruit. however. unless the countries involved are assisted in developing the essential resources that support strong business enterprises. power. roads. water supplies. and capital are as essential  as they were 2 years ago. it may be a few years before we see the kind of results we hope for in latin america. but we can stop  with half measures. it is my hope that the reduction in alliance for progress authority can be restored.
. the passage of legislation by the house today designating the bedford veterans administration hospital as the edith rse rogers memorial hospital is a tribute to a great lady and a measure of the esteem and affection with which she is held by all who knew of her good works. mrs. rogers worked tirelessly to help individuals in their relations with the ever growing. increasingly complex federal government. veterans became her special charge and patients at the bedford hospital still recall her frequent visits and her constant interest in the affairs of the hospital. in large measure this legislation could  have been passed without the splendid cooperation of my distinguished colleague from massachusetts. william h. bates. congressman bates spared effort to bring about this ho to the memory of mrs. rogers. the gentleman from massachusetts. congressman bates. served here in the house with mrs. rogers as did his father before him. he ks at first hand the outstanding service that was given to the fifth congressional district by the woman i was hoed to succeed in 1961. on behalf of the fifth district. i would like to express my gratitude to the gentleman from massachusetts. congressman bates. and to the members of the veterans affairs committee. for making this wonderful tribute possible.
i rise in tribute to the memory of dr. man welch. a distinguished resident of the commonwealth of massachusetts. dr. welch has compiled a distinguished record of scientific accomplishment and service to his profession. his death thursday. in jackson. wyo.. where he was to address the wyoming medical society. comes as a tremendous shock. dr. welch compiled a distinguished record at tufts university. from which he was graduated in 1929. summa cum laude. and president of his class. he served as clinical professor of medicine at tufts. and as an instructor at the boston university school of medicine. a member of the american medical association house of delegates from 1951. and its speaker from 1959 to 1963. dr. welch capped his career in 1963 with his election to the presidency of the association. dr. welchs death is a severe blow to the entire medical profession and. of course. to his fine family. mrs. morse joins me in extending deepest sympathy to mrs. welch and to their four fine children.
. i rise in support of s. 4 as reported by the public works committee. in the 9 years since congress first enacted a permanent program for an assault on the growing problem of water pollution. we have made important strides in the improvement of water quality. in 1961. i supported legislation to broaden and expand this program and was particularly pleased that the research function would be emphasized to a greater degree. the efforts to date have borne fruit. but as the public works committee has pointed out. we are just holding our ownwe are  really getting at the root of the problem. for this reason. i think that the bill before us today is necessary. if we wait much longer to intensify our attack. the battle may be lost. it is estimated that we will be doubling our water consumption in the next two decades. it is clear that we have got to develop far more effective means of reusing water if we are to meet the rapidly rising demand for water for home. inindustrial. and scientific use. this bill contemplates such an effort by including funds for projects to develop new means of waste disposal and control of discharge from sewers. water treatment also will benefit. the cost of pollution control is expensive. but how much greater is the cost if we measure it in terms of lost opportunities for industrial development. or in terms of the health and happiness of our communities. this legislation properly removes the limit on grants for waste treatment plants. at the same time. however. it provides incentives for state and local initiative and participation. in short. it creates the opportunity for real partnership in this field. in new england and particularly in massachusetts. we have been blessed with an abundance of water for power and recreational purposes. i believe that this legislation can provide us with an opportunity to preserve that precious resource and open up a new era of ecoic growth and give our people the pure water they need for health and recreational use. i urge the passage of the pending legislation. cxi549
. i am today introducing legislation that will permit the offering of surplus materials from the federal stockpile to educational and health institutions before they are offered for public sale. this will put these surplus materials in the same category as federal furniture and other equipment that is made available by the general services administration to this type of institution. an experimental program was carried on in massachusetts with the distribution of mercury. four hundred and fifty flasks were made available to public and private schools. colleges. and hospitals with great success. the program resulted in a saving of $5.89 per pound in health and education budgets. it seems to me that this is an opportunity to encourage research and scientific education at very little cost. the success of the preliminary distributions indicates that we should make this offering mandatory.
. you name it. i think that is about as bad as it can get. thus. i do  recognize the intrastate argument which those on the committee have had to deal with for a while. they had some people who made technical and literal legal arguments on its behalf. but i want to say that when i go into state x. y. or z. there is intrastate right within that state to serve meat in a hotel or on any other table that does  meet federal standards. therefore. i think we should face the factas was pointed out by the clear implication in what the senator from florida said a moment agothat the federal government does have the right to step in and protect the health of the american people. we are living in a mobile society. the early concept of socalled intrastate rights developed in our legal system when there was  much mobility. but. serving meat in a hotel or a home to a visitor from outside the state. in my judgment. really washes off the legal blackboard. so to speak. the claim that they should be protected in doing that on the basis of a states rights argument. the senator from iowa made comment about imported meat. there is a problem there. too. at the present time. there is prevailing in england probably the worst. contagious bovine epidemic in the history of the british isles. i do  k what the facts are. i do k the allegations. and on the basis of those allegations. the british government has acted. the allegation is that some diseased meat came in through importation. as a result. england has cut off the importation of meat from a good many parts of the world. i understand it is also true that meat from carcasses of foot and mouth diseased animals is a threat to human health.  i want to talk for a moment about the ecoic consequences of what would happen if we were subjected to the kind of loss to which england is  being subjected. if the allegation is true that diseased meat from aher country was shipped into england which caused the hoof and mouth epidemic  sweeping the british isles. it is  only the ecoic aspect of the problem. but also the health aspect that must be considered. we have been talking about cattle. but there is also the shocking failure to carry out the moral obligation in some intrastate plants. where i k of instances in which diseased chickens coming down the track were rejected by u.s. inspectors. were taken out of some of the small killing plants and moved  so many miles away into an intrastate plant and processed. there is doubt that housewives have every reason to express the fears they have to us around the dining tables of our friends. in whose homes we have been having dinner in recent weeks. the situation must be cleaned up. i want to highly commend the senaators i have already mentioned. but i also wish to commend the administration for the support it has given the program. i commend also congress as a whole for what the senator from oklahoma said in effect was the passage of legislation on this subject which could very well be compared to the original pure food and drug law.
 of the united states when he was majority leader of this body. i believe these dropouts from honest journalism in the press galleryan epidemic which seems to be contagiousare doing a great disservice to the republic by uncalled for and false attacks upon both the previous majority leader. mr. lyndon johnson. and the present majority leader . i intend to discuss that problem later this aftern. because the american people need to take warning that if they believe they are getting an accurate. honest account of the operations of congress from many of those who are writing on the subject from the senate press gallery. they could  be more mistaken.
. the summer debate dreamed up by messrs. evans and ak. in light of the facts. was impossible. i shall. however. be happy to apologize publicly to any senator who rushed back to washington for the debate last summer and who was furious with me over it. if he will give me an inkling of when he was inconvenienced. or how he could be inconvenienced in a debate that could  possibly have taken place during the summer because the material was  ready for the consideration of the senate until well into the fall. the debate on the higher education bill took place in october. and the only postponement of debate on it occurred as the majority leader ks. i had previously planned to cancel a trip to oregon. where on october 15 i was to receive a distinguished service award from the university of oregon. when i was informed that the leadership would like to take up the higher education bill on october 15. then i learned further that several senators would  be ready to vote on that day because they were at work on several amendments and could  have their own ready by october 15. some of these were amendments of a basic nature which. in my judgment. might have seriously harmed the bill and against which i wished to rally the full support of my subcommittee. in addition. a sudden acute illness in my family. which i discussed with the majority leader. made it highly desirable to obtain the medical advice and examination of our portland family physician. dr. charles grossman. in view of all of these circumstances. and the desire of the leadership to dispose of s. 649. the federal water pollution control act. both the majority leader and the miity leader agreed to a postponement of the debate of the higher education bill. h.r. 6143. from the close of business october 15 to monday. october 21. the lie has already been put to the claim that these writers make. next to the effect that because "morse could  make it" the final vote on the foreign aid bill was postponed to december 30. as the majority leader said on the floor that day: during the course of the meeting of the senate on tuesday last. it was indicated or at least implied that the reason why the senate did  act on the conference report. which had been agreed to that morning by the house. was that a promise had been made by the leadership to the distinguished senator from oregon . hing could be further from the truth. promise was made to the senator from oregon.  was any pledge requested by him. as the senator from montana explained. the leaders of both parties had made it clear that a yeaandnay vote would be taken on the conference report. the leadership on both sides of the aisle consulted with a cross section of their membership and decided to put the vote over until after christmas. as the majority leader made clear. the senator from oregon had hing whatever to do with that decision. since it is in the interest of evans and ak to perpetuate this lie. i do  suppose that correcting it at this time will have any more effect on them than did correcting it on december 30. it is in keeping with their low standards of legislative ethics that evans and ak seem to think it right and proper. and indeed necessary. for the senate to adopt an important measure with only 11 members present. that is how many were present on the "day before christmas" when they think the final vote should have been taken. thank goodness the majority and miity leadership of this body have some respect for representative government and for the procedures needed to preserve it. finally. the presumptuousness of such conceited alleged journalists as evans. ak. smith. and their jaundicetinged cohorts in purporting to advise their readers who should be selected as official change treaty and socalled bridge building between east and west serves the reds to spread their propaganda lies here. tenis zierins.
i am saying that we should  look at the internal combustion engine today. but the internal combustion engine that will have to be made to meet these standards. i believe right today steam buses would oe excellent to have right here in new york city. for example. those are the general comments i have. perhaps i have gone too long. but it is a funny kind of business. it is highly competitive. but i think the blame can be shared by us. the public. and those in congress. as well as the auto industry. congressman farstein. thank you very much. professor morse. i bow my head as a member of congress who has tried to do something in this area  very successfully because the public hasnt been made aware. they do  have the information on the effect upon health of the pollution produced by the internal combustion engine. or else they would demand either of their government. or their company that has produced these automobiles a radical change. mr. lear. i read in the newspapers some days ago. said that the steam engine was  eminently feasible. would you care to comment on his statement. after all. because he is supposedly a pretty good technician
. in this year. 1970. the gentleman is aware that this ad- medical care is still  available for the ministration has done a remarkable job people of our country and the commitalready in the reallocation of our re- tees increases in the bill were timid for sources. the most part. timid and less than meanas an example. i will cite the fact that ingful. the boland amendment will take while the department of defense budget the long step needed to stop the accelwas 45 percent of the overall government erating deterioration of our medical care spending in the last year of the johnson system. administration. that itis  37 percent this country has the brains and the in this year in the nixon budget. resources to provide the best medical care
. i am introducing legislation today designed to facilitate our transition to a peacetime ecoy and to alleviate the problems which many of our industries and communities throughout the nation are facing as a result of declining levels of defense and space spending. a companion bill is scheduled to be filed in the senate tomorrow by senator george mcgovern. since 1964. when i first proposed the establishment of a national ecoic conversion commission to study and plan for an orderly and gradual move away from ecoic dependence on military procurement programs. i have continued to urge proper attention to concrete planning for our longrange ecoic health. last year. as the effects of a winding down of the vietnam war on our ecoy were becoming increasingly visible. i was gratified that some 48 members of the house joined congressman jonathan bingham and myself in reintroducing that bill. today. in 1970. however. the problem of conversion is directly before us. and the kind of action envisaged by the legislation i first proposed in 1964 is longer adequate. we need to do more than conduct studies of the governments role in the conversion process. concrete action is imperative. i am. therefore. joining with mr. bingham today to offer new legislation. entitled "the national ecoic conversion act". which supersedes earlier efforts and goes beyond my previous proposals. it incorporates the original provision for the creation of a national ecoic conversion commission. but broadens its operational authority to aid in implementing conversion plans and to protect those workers who lose their jobs because of reduced levels of space and military expenditure. it seeks to provide compelling incentives for military contractors to start planning for conversion and implementing a shift of their capital and labor force to civilian needs as rapidly as possible. it establishes a trust fund to cover some of the costs of conversion. there is a critical need for an orderly program since the predictable downward trend of military and space spending. combined with the effect of current antiinflationary restrictions. could result in a loss of employment for millions of american workers. effective action must be taken  to prevent these individuals. firms. and the communities in which they are located. from suffering lextreme financial discomfort at best. and ecoic disaster in many instances. every single citizen will benefit emously. furthermore. as the techogy. the resources. and the management skills developed by so many of our defense and aerospacerelated industries are increasingly channeled into areas urgently needing the nations attention -areas such as improving our transportation systems and facilities. developing ways to solve our urban decay and housing needs. expanding research efforts in health and medical techogy. effectively controlling air and water pollution. and developing new sources of power. to name but a few. the possibility of impending peace poses a vast potential for progress. and we must move  if we are to take full advantage of it. the national ecoic conversion bill. the text of which follows. will. i strongly believe. insure that we are heading in that direction: h.r. 19557 a bill to facilitate and encourage cooperation between the united states and certain defense contractors engaged in the furnishing of defense material to the united states in providing for an orderly conversion from defense to civilian production. and to assure. through such cooperation. that the united states and such defense contractors will be able to meet the challenge arising out of the ecoic conversion and diversification required by reason of the changing defense needs of the united states to provide for such an orderly conversion in an effort to minimize. to the extent possible. the hardships and other disruptive factors likely to be encountered by defense workers and their families as a result thereof be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the "national ecoic conversion act."
. mental retardation is one of the most serious. and unfortunately. most neglected problem facing this nation today. of the some 6 million retarded children and adults in the united states. only a handful are receiving the medical. educational. and rehabilitation services they need. much of the reason for this is the critical shortage of trained personnel who can educate these children to take care of themselves and to assume a productive and contributing role in society. and the lack of adequate facilities to train this personnel. the care and treatment of the developmentally disadvantaged. requires the training of highly competent individuals in a number of disciplines. including pediatrics. neurology. social service. psychology. speech and hearing. nutrition. special education. physical and occupational therapy. and vocational rehabilitation. to mention but a few. the prevention. amelioration. and eradication of the multidimensional causes and conditions of mental retardation. moreover. will demand a corps of professionals and paraprofessionals prepared to assume positions of responsibility in schools. community and residential agencies. clinics and hospitals. the need for such manpower can be denied. without it. the treatment which we propose to provide and the hope which we offer to the mentally retarded can never be fulfilled. to help meet the need for trained personnel and adequate facilities to train them. my distinguished colleague from new york. congresswomen abzug. has offered an amendment to the laborhew appropriations bill before us . which would provide $10 million for the operation and $5 million for the construction of university affiliated facilities. i enthusiastically support this amendment. the university affiliated facilities program was authorized by congress in 1963 to help provide settings which would train professionals in the variety of disciplines necessary for the care and treatment of the mentally retarded. these university affiliated facilities. of which there are  20. are designed to develop and implement improved. interdisciplinary approaches to the problems of the mentally retarded. integrating all aspects of necessary services and disciplines. new and inative approaches to the training of professionals and paraprofessionals. and to educating and supporting the handicapped. at lower costs to society. are being developed at these facilities. and the 91st congress. recognizing their contribution recently extended funding for the construction of these facilities. for training and demonstration programs. and for operation funds. to 1973. thirtyseven million dollars. moreover. was actually authorized for fiscal year despite the authorization. funds for the construction and operation of new facilities were included in the laborhew appropriations bill reported to the house. while $13.4 million .of the funds appropriated for maternal and child health will be available for the university program. these moneys can only be used to support the medical aspects of existing programs. it does  support the operation of the medical disciplines that participate in the interdisciplinary program. such as the special service in vocational rehabilitation. or the operation of new facilities. over the years. we have recognized the pressing need to provide services to the mentally retarded and their families. we have recognized the need to improve our approaches to the problems of mental retardation. and we have recognized the need for continuing federal support of community mental health programs. we have also. i am sure. recognized the critical need for trained manpower and adequate training facilities if these services are truly to be provided. and yet. while the universityaffiliated facilities have developed exciting and highly valuable strategies to meet the need for a large group of bettertrained personnel able to provide more effective services. congress has failed to appropriate funds for the construction of desperately needed new facilities since 1968. if this program is  supported. however. the progress which has been made to date is apt to be lost. and we may well see a return to the apathy which once before greeted the plight of the disabled. i hope the house will take the steps necessary to help prevent this. and approve the amendment before it.
. i would like to take this opportunity to thank the chairman and the members of the committee on veterans affairs for bringing this bill to the floor of the house. i feel that it is indeed appropriate that the veterans administration hospital in bedford. mass.. should be designated the edith rse rogers memorial hospital and stand as a memorial to the dedication  of the committee on veterans affairs during both the 80th and 83d congresses. during her long service in the congress. mrs. rogers was especially interested in the entire operation of the bedford hospital. located in her congressional district. and i feel that the designation of this facility in her memory is a fitting tribute to her steadfast dedication to the cause of veterans everywhere. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. the title was amended so as to read: "a bill to designate the veterans administration hospital at bedford. mass.. as the edith rse rogers memorial veterans hospital. and for other purposes." a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
that being the situation. the committee was then. i take it. instructed by the senateup until the present time of reconsideration. at least. this condition would appear to prevailto take 5 percent off the bill. in line with the terms of the amendment. and to have that 5 percent cover  only what was in the bill when originally reported to the senate. but also the amounts added for heart research and for cancer research. together with other items which were added by amendment in the senate. is that correct.
. it seems to me that the primary purpose of any statutory provision aimed at meeting the problems inherent in labormanagement disputes which imperil the national health and safety is twofold. of first importance is the settlement of the dispute and the reaching of an agreement which is satisfactory to all the parties in dispute. of next and almost equal importance is the prevention of a work stoppage attributable tosuch dispute--or. at least. the limiting of any work stoppage to such a point that it will  prove damaging to the national health and safety. as is generally kn. the tafthartley act provision which deals with this type of emergency. while providing for a coolingoff period and a factfinding board and other procedures calculated to bring about a settlement of the controversy. nevertheless emphasizes the injunction as the principal means by which to meet the problem. by this method of approach. the most salutary media for reaching settlementsin labormanagement disputes have been given secondary consideration. moreover. the definition of "national emergency." or the means by which such a national emergency is determined. has  been written or expressed in the act. save by indirection. for these reasons. a number of disputes have been proclaimed to be national in scope and emergency in character. although in fact they have  met these qualifications. at the same time. the injunction has. been employed in instances in which its use did  seem justified. in any event. procedures could have been followed. and action taken in keeping with the nature of the dispute. which would have produced the ultimate results which were sought. without stirring up additional controversy because of the injunction and because of the questionable use of the acts emergency provisions. i have never been convinced that the injunction. as a permanent device in the process of resolving labormanagement controversies. is either sound or appropriate. the fact that after it has been used. a dispute may finally have been resolved. has  justified its use. the fact remains that its exercise may have handicapped earlier settlement of disputes and may have kept alive animosities and illfeeling which otherwise might have been dissipated. two other proposals to meet national emergency conditions which may arise in labor relations have been proposed and seriously considered. one of these proposals is compulsory arbitration. but neither management  labor wishes compulsory arbitration of any nature. and this proposal has long since been abandoned. the second proposal is plant or industry seizure by the government. this procedure is most dubious as a palliative by which to produce industrial peace and
furthermore. the senator from new york would like to point out that if the able senator from missouri would be willing to make an analysis of conditions in the country which might -be construed to offer possibilities of provoking a national emergency such as that to which we are  referring. he would find that th6 number of such situations is rather limited. in fact. it would appear that. aside from the question of atomic energy. which the junior senator from new york feels should be handled separately in any case. only coal or steeland there is some question as to whether steel in every instance would fall within this categoryor nationwide communications. including  only the telephone but the telegraph. and possibly even the radio. or shipping on the various coasts of the nationperhaps the two coasts. atlantic and pacificis likely to be a matter which would fall naturally within the purview of the general subject we are discussing. i doubt if there are any others. the junior senator from new york would like to stress the fact that in one of those cases is it all probable that a work stoppage would be conducive to imperiling the national health and safety. provided the work stoppage were of limited duration. under the provisions of the amendment offered by the junior senator from new york. the speedingup process by which this question would be acted upon by the president through the initial operation of the emergency board and brought to the attention of congress. even though there might be a few days delay due to discussion in the congress. in all probability would  in any way .imperil the national health and safety.
i should like to ask the senator from missouri if he can think of any other industrial areas in our ecoy. other than the ones mentioned by the senator from new york. in which a work stoppage might occur by which there would be a national emergency which would imperil the national health and safety.
i understand that those in the medical profession always have to take a certain amount of the humanities in order to qualify to enter the profession. the point i am trying to find out is what the intent was. i understood the senator from massachusetts to say that all these categories rank equally.
. last week the nation lost. through death. one of the greatest exponents of cancer education. dr. louis c. kress. director of the roswell park memorial institute at buffalo. n. y. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the body of the record at this point in my remarks a short statement which i have prepared concerning dr. kress.
. i believe that he should very promptly take out voluntary insurance coverage for workmens compensation in the seized plants. and. with respect to the states with cash sickness benefit laws. he should bind coverage for those claims. as well. unless he does this. there is certain to be confusion among the workers in the steel plants and needless deprivation of social insurance rights to which they have become accustomed and to which they are morally entitled. withstanding legal barriers that may be raised under the seizure. under our new yirk state laws the sickness benefits of the steel workers are. for the most part. benefits that have been negotiated through collective bargaining with their employers. these benefits are insured with insurance companies on such terms that the question as to whether the carrier is liable. if the employees are indeed  employees of the federal government. naturally arises. workmens compensation is a program with which i was much concerned when i was a member of the new york legislature. this form of insurance and the newer disability benefits in force there constitute sound methods of social insurance for workers. hasty action by the chief executive should be permitted to impair them.
. on behalf of myself and the senator from vermont i introduce. for appropriate reference. a proposed national health act of 1953. i ask unanimous consent to speak for  to exceed 3 minutes on the bill.
. the bill. among other purposes. will facilitate the broader distribution of health services and increase the quantity and improve the quality of such services and facilities. identical legislation is being introduced in the house of representatives by representative hale and representative javits. if enacted. this bill will be called the national health act of 1953 and will provide a voluntary program of health insurance in response to the health needs of the people of the united states. this is substantially the same bill which we cosponsored and introduced in 1949 in the first session of the 81st congress. we are reintroducing it in modified form. in the belief that it is designed to provide adequate health care in a manner consistent with our countrys traditions of freedom. and that it should be considered along with other proposals having a similar purpose. which may come before the senate. by such a course of action. the health needs of the nation can be met realistically within the framework of our free institutions and without resort to government intervention and control. the cornerstone of the national .healthinsurance program advocated in this bill is the local. voluntary. prepayment health service plan. many such plans are in operation today. unfortunately. their cost is beyond the means of a large segment of the population. the increasing popularity of these plans. however. demonstrates that the voluntary approach to the exigencies imposed by ill health is the solution desired by the majority of the peopleif it is designed in consideration of their financial resources. the voluntary health and medical service program embodied in this bill basically is financial assistance to voluntary. profit. prepayment. health plans. primary responsibility for the development of adequate health services is placed in the states and local communities. with the fullest encouragement to local initiative. the people are thus offered the maximum in assistance with the minimum of governmental interference. through this proposed legislation. the health problems of the nation are met in terms of present available services. while the necessary incentives are provided for additional medical facilities.
it includes everyone. it is entirely voluntary. there is hing at all compulsory about it. . at this point in my remarks i ask to have printed in the record the text of a r6sum. of the national health act of 1953.
. so far as i have been able to observe. there is conflict whatever between what is proposed in the amendment and the provisions of the hillburton act. the amendment simply modifies the procedure. it is an amplification of the process. it is a complementary undertaking. i think the proposal will be very useful. as the senator from utah has pointed out. in situations where hospitals desperately need assistance. the money provided under the hillbarton act is  sufficient. damage whatsoever will be done to the hillburton act if the amendment is adopted. since the measure is a communityfacilities bill. the amendment to provide for assistance to hospitals properly belongs in the bill. i do  see how anyone can be for the bill and object to such an amendment as is offered. i hope the amendment will prevail.
i would like to compliment the gentleman from connecticut on his initiative. i feel strongly that this amendment should be voted on and passed by the house. i think it. essential throughout these united states that the congress be clearly on record that we behieve in equality of op-. portunity for an education on merit. i think it would be repugnant if we passed legislation that might preclude any. american from an opportunity to gain a medical education. for reasons of race. creed. color. or national origin and hence i hope the house will vote affirmatively on this amendment. we must have equality of opportunity for all americans .
. i would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from minnesota. in westchester county on long island sound. n.y.. there is a clear and serious water pollution problem. i think the gentlemans amendment should be supported. at mamaroneck. in particular. there is a request and application on the order of $600.000 for a treatment sewage plant involving seven communities. this is an urgent health matter for westchester residents and affects my countys entire water pollution control program. i think there is a clear need for an expanded federal program in this area. and i urge that the amendment be adopted.
. i am happy to support the senate amendment to h.r. 3369. extending the life of the u.s. commission on civil rights for 1 year. the commissions authority lapsed on october 1. 1963. the civil rights commission has been engaged in important work in the broad fields of voting. employment. housing. justice. health facilities. services. and urban areas. the negro in the armed forces. and with state advisory committees. it should have an opportunity to continue. and i hope that the pending civil rights bill  before the house judiciary committee. when reported out. will call for a permanent u.s. commission on civil rights.
. it is unfortunate. however. that the committee did  include in this legislation a federalstate matching grant program for the construction of facilities for the treatment of these addicts. the civil commitment procedure that we are adopting. i hope here today. is just a beginning. what is to happen to the addict if there are facilities. what is to happen to the addict who might be committed under this law. as i understand it. the answer is that he will  be committed even if otherwise eligible because the surgeon general may have to certify that adequate facilities or personnel for treatment are unavailable. so i hope that the house at an early date will consider legislation providing for the construction of facilities. this is clearly and drastically needed in new york and in westchester county. while what we are doing today is an important beginning. i believe it is only a beginning. and we must take the other additional steps.
s attention to page 119 of the hearings where i believe dr. luther l. terry. the then surgeon general. testified with regard to the two federal facilities. fort worth and lexington. and there he pointed out: our constructed bed capacity at the fort worth hospital is 775 beds. whereas last year our average daily patient census was 778. or 3 more patients on the average. running a little above 100 percent occupancy.... on the other hand. with regard to lexington. the constructed bed capacity of lexington is 994 beds. and during 1964 we had an average daily patient load of 1.035. or about 100 more patients than the facility was constructed to accommodate.... so. from the standpoint of the utilization of beds. we are utilizing them to an almost pheenal degree inasmuch as we in essence are running at 100 percent capacity. and this is above the initial constructed capacity at all times. i further checked today with the surgeon generals office and mr. stewart indicates that there is still overcrowding. that there are beds in the hallways. and that these two facilities are in excess of 100percent constructed capacity . i would ask the gentleman from new york if he is aware of that situation with regard to these two hospitals.
 to seek appointment by a federal court of a special receiver to operate the struck facilities to the extent which. in the opinion of the court. is necessary to protect the public health and safety. fourth. extend coverage of the emergency labor disputes provisions of the tafthartley act. including these new provisions as well as the existing 80day coolingoff provisions. to controversies which. though they may  affect an entire industry  imperil the health or safety of the nation as a whole. do affect interstate commerce and do imperil the health and safety of a substantial part of the population or territory of the nation. and cover employees of a state or political subdivision if they are engaged in transportation. transmission. or communication. this legislation would require a factfinding board and subsequent bargaining within a period of 30 days. during this time public opinion would have a chance to assert itself. the proposal does  involve compulsory arbitrationthe negotiations would be voluntary and carried out by the parties themselves.
. the death of our colleague. john e. fogarty. deprives america of a legislator with a breadth of humanitarian vision that will be deeply missed. his tireless efforts on behalf of the health of his fellow citizens gave major thrust to needed federal support for basic research in cancer. heart. and other diseases. the importance of the national institutes of health as one of the major medical research centers in the world is largely a tribute to his continual concern as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on health. education. and welfare. my deepest sympathy is extended to his wife and daughter.
. the hazards to health and the inconveniences to daily life caused by increasing pollution of the air. especially in the new york city area. are painfully obvious to all. the time has long passed when we should have begun to deal with this problem. effective and major abatement  requires the cooperation of all levels and locations of government. all facets of private industry and each individual citizen. the proposed commission is a promising new approach in this direction and i am hopeful that the congress will give this implementing legislation swift approval.
. my amendment would do two things. first. it restores $11.6 million to the appropriations for comprehensive health services. this is the amount by which the budget request for project grants was reducedi will repeatthis is merely within the budget---and a budgetary request. members will recall that section 314(e). the projects grant section. was that section to which an additional $20 million authorization was added last year in the partnership for health amendments. while the legislation last year did  so state. the second part of my amendment would specifically earmark $20 million of the funds appropriated for comprehensive health services to be used for rat control projects. i think it should be ed by the members of the committee that the 1968 second supplemental of this house provided appropriations--i repeatappropriations for rat control. i would point out .that in the other body the supplemental request provided $13 million. quite simply. therefore. this amendment would insure that money intended to be used for rat control projects will  be sidetracked to other endeavors also financed by the project grants section of 314(e). that thousands of infants are bitten each year in their cribs. in slums and better neighborhoods alike. and that thousands of adults regularly share their living quarters with these filthy. diseasebearing rodents is an indignity and a national shame. statistics on rat bites are  always reported. it was indicated that for 1967 about 1.000 persons suffered rat bites in 7 cities aloneatlanta. baltimore. cleveland. new york. philadelphia. st. louis. and washington. there are estimated to be well over 200 million rats in the united states. which do about $900 million in property damage annually. at least one rat per person. and in some areas there are two rats or more for every square yard. we can permit this situation to continue. each child bitten by a rat in a ghetto area is one too many. $20 million already programed to be spent this year is  too much to set aside as a beginning. and it is only a beginning. for rat extermination. for demolition of rat harborages. for cutting down the source of food supply---such as putting trash and garbage collection on a better and more efficient basis. lids on garbage cans--for education in various areas. and for better food storage in the home. i would submit to the members of the committee that it is wrong for people to have to live with rats. that rat bites of children. as we all k. can be extremely serious and at times fatal. that filth and danger of disease in this regard in our cities and in other areas of the country is just  acceptable. there is  a major city today that does  have a rat problem. and to millions in the slums of america rats are an enemy and a nightmare to children and to invalids. the house. i believe. should be specific on this matter.  vague in its appropriations. the funds should be ample and  tightfisted. and at least equivalent t the budget. a sense of urgency should animate our actions in this matter. a country that is indifferent to rats and disease and filth and the psychological horror that this means in our ghetto areas is. in some small measure. clearly indifferent to the poor. i urge the adoption of the amendment.
i talked to the public health service and to hew. and it is my understanding that very little has as yet been spent. that the only money that has been approved as yet by either body is the money contained in the second supplemental in 1968 by the senate.
on the point the gentleman is making. and it is a very accurate and eloquent point. the principal expert who appeared before our committee on nutrition from the department of agriculture made an explicit statement on the record that we k more about nutrition overseas than we k about nutrition here at home. he indicated unequivocally that there are millions of americans who suffer from some degree of malnutrition. he stated without question there is a great deal we do  k  about the fortification of diets. and that this information could be extremely valuable.
. i rise in strong support of h.r. 10946. a bill to promote health and safety in the building trades and construction industry in all federal and federally financed or assisted construction projects. this bill would authorize the secretary of labor to promulgate federal safety standards on federal construction projects after public hearings and consultation with an advisory board. and would thereby extend to workers in the construction industry protection which is already provided to employees of federal suppliers and service contractors. in 1968. approximately 2.800 construction workers were killed on the jobthis is the highest death rate for an industry in the united states. over 20 percent of the workers killed yearly and over 11 percent of the workers disabled in onthejob accidents in the united states are in the construction industry. the frequency rate for construction accidents is nearly double the national average. this bill. insofar as it will raise safety standards for construction workers on federal projects. will also reduce the number of serious construction accidents and the number of injuries to employees. i hope that the congress will later enact the full occupational health and safety legislation to insure safe and healthful working conditions for all employees in this nation. certainly this bill is a good beginningbut broader legislation is vital.
. i rise in support of the ottinger amendments. which would revise the formula for allocation of hospital aid funds under the hillburton hospital act. in 1946. when hillburton was first adopted. there was a clear need for new health facilities in this nations rural areas. today. in 1969. the needs of our urban areas are just as greatand yet we still spend approximately 70 percent of hillburton funds in cities of less than 50.000. in my judgment. the formula  being used to allocate hospital aid funds results in discrimination against the desperately crowded inner cities. the amendments being offered by my colleague from new york would end that discrimination by providing more money for modernizationwhich most city hospitals needand shifting the  ruralbased grant formula to one based on per capita needs. an editorial in this mornings new york times stated that these "amendments are an important beginning in putting the money where the need is most urgent." i commend the editorial to the attention of my colleagues.
. the budget request for loans to medical students under the health professions student loan fund is almost 50 percent below the money available last year. the gentleman from new york and i are jointly offering this amendment on page 21. line 8. to strike out the figure of $218 million. and to insert $232 million. this amendment will provide an additional $14.800.000. for loans to medical students under the health professions student loan fundpart c. title vii. of the public health service act. the appropriation must be increased by this large an amount for two reasons. first. the need for loan funds is already far outrunning the money available. there are 100 medical schools in this country with a total enrollment of 34.018. the schools have requested a total of $20.983.026 for loans for this fiscal year. the budget allots $7.924.353 of that request. this is just about half of what was available last year and about onethird of what is needed to insure that enrolled students and new students will be able to continue or begin their medical education. some 23.000 students received loans last year and if the appropriation is  increased. many thousands will have to drop out or  enroll at all because of terminated or reduced loans. the additional $14.800.000 would maintain support to schools previously participating in this program at the 1969 level. provide support for new schools entering the program for the first time. and allow for expanding enrollments of continuing schools. particularly for needs of disadvantaged students being admitted to first year classes. a total of $17.943.353 would then be available for the loan program. the second reason that the appropriation must be increased is that the report accompanying this bill directs that the increase in scholarships for health professions studentsabout half of whom are medical students---be transferred to the loan program. for several reasons. i believe it most unwise to do this. and. while the parliamentary situation under which this bill is presented does  make it possible to amend the bill in this regard as this item does  appear in the bill itself. the legislative history of this amendment will show that the loan fund appropriation is increased by sufficient funds to allow the scholarship moneys  to be transferred. thereby leaving the scholarships at the same level as the budget requested. the scholarship funds can be transferred. first of all. because the awards have already been made for the new school year. we are. in effect. directing medical schools to tell students who are counting on scholarships that what they were told last month must be rescinded. this is an unconscionable breach of faith on the part of the congress. second. these scholarship funds are needed to give such aid to all four classes of students. until fiscal year 1970. only three classes were covered. with the increase of $4.781.000 that the budget requested for this fiscal year. the fourth class would also be covered as intended in the basic legislation. the administration had hoped that the guaranteed loan program of the higher education act of 1965 would be able to assist many medical students whose health professions loans would be reduced or terminated. that hope has unfortunately  proven to be a fruitful source of funds because the tight credit market is making it exceedingly difficult for any students to get loans under this program and because the reduction in loan funds was made kn to medical schools only earlier this monthsome 6 weeks before the new school term begins. whatever guaranteed loans might have been available have long since disappeared. and medical students are left but a short time before school begins with source of support. the department of hew estimates that we need 52.000 more physicians right . and that by 1976 we will still need 41.000. our 100 medical schools  produce about 8.500 graduates a yearclearly an insufficient number. the administration. in its budget request. indicated its interest in encouraging the physician augmentation program in order to produce some 4.000 additional docjuly. 29. 1969 tors by 1973. this is indeed a laudatory objective but i can understand the logic in financing this program by taking $5 million from the funds allotted to medical student loans. as the report directs on page 30. frankly. i do  understand how it is proposed that these additional medical students to speak of present medical studentsare to finance their education if the loan funds are reduced. many students have expressed eloquently the hardships they are undergoing to finance their medical educations. and the greatest deprivation. if  termination of their careers. that will ensue from a reduction in loan funds. such a situation will surely  close the gap between the number of physicians this nation needs and the number we are  educating. it is simply the most shortsighted and cheap sort of ecoy to cut in half the funds that enable potential physicians to be trained. i should like to insert in the record at this point a paragraph from a letter i have received from dr. harry gordon. dean of the albert einstein college of medicine in new york. and a table of the appropriation history of medical student loan funds. dr. gordon writes: it is appalling that the federal and state governments have  taken into consideration the fact that there is an increasing number of miity group students unable to support their education and an expanding number of students from low and middle income families who find it extremely difficult to attend medical schools. at a time when we have become increasingly aware of our acutely understaffed medical services. this will have a socially undesirable effect on our recruiting policies for health expansion.
is it  a fact that there was a commitment to provide increased funds in the sum of $4.7 million for scholarships to enable all four classes to get scholarships. and that an additional $10 million. at the minimum. is necessary to provide loan funds close to the amount requested by the medical schools. is it  correct that the effect of our action today would be to make it impossible for some of the students in their third year to complete their fourth year in the medical curriculum. and. therefore. the effect is to break faith with these students and actually cut back on the number that would be trained had this $14 million been made available.
it is my understanding that transferring the $4.7 million will hurt students presently enrolled and all i am asking  is that we consider maintaining the amounts necessary so that those who have completed a portion of their medical training can complete their final years.
 nixon. in his message to congress on drug abuse. said: proper evaluation and solution of the drug problem in this country has been severely handicapped by a dearth of scientific information on the subjectand the prevalence of igance and misinformation. the national institute of mental health  has a number of studies in progress. and others are underway financed both through federal funds and private sources. in a recent letter to me. dr. roger 0. egeberg. assistant secretary of health. education. and welfare for health and scientific affairs. stated: the department. through the national institute of mental health. is placing heavy emphasis on the support and conduct of research in the area of narcotics and dangerous drugs. and the dissemination of scientifically accurate information about these agents. we are convinced that only through such efforts can we develop a firm basis for public decisions in this critical area. for example. i think that before we can effectively determine the penalties for possession and use of marihuana. we should k as precisely as possible what its immediate and longterm effects are. both physiologically and psychologically. and the nature of the relationship between marihuana use and the abuse of other drugs. some of the most eminent medical authorities are divided in their answers to these questions. and i do  see how we could presume to prescribe penalties for use of marihuana before we k what we are dealing with. in short. we must focus the attention of the country on the realities of marihuana usagewhatever they may turn out to beand  the fears. i think that the bill before us is the first step in this information process. and i urge that it be approved.
 nixons comments on vista in his august 11 statement. he said: some proven programs which are national in scope should. however. remain in oeo because they can help us develop new experiments and because of the agencys special identification with the problems of the poor. the vista program is one example. it will make a greater effort to attract people with specific technical and professional skills to its ranks. section 810(b) of existing law already prohibits the assignment of volunteers to a state without the consent of the gover. frankly. i can see how this proposal will contribute to the maximum utilization of the energies and skills of those americans who seek to help those less fortunate than themselveswhich is. after all. what vista intended to do. finally. point  3: a series of other programs. such as legal services. family planning. comprehensive health services. emergency food and medical services. senior opportunities and services. indians. and perhaps headstart. followthrough. and other components. would all have to be part of a state plan or in some way go through the state before they could be approved.
 of the committee on veterans affairs has made plain. and as the report of the committee made manifest. there is an overall shortage of 25.000 personnel. minus the 8.600 that will be provided shortlyleaving almost 17.000 short. i talked with mr. johnson earlier today. and he pointed out that there is still a shortage of psychiatrists and anesthesiologists. in my judgment. we are understating the problems of drug treatment as well. he ed that the va plans to treat 12.000 drug cases in 1972. but surely. in my view. this can be sufficient. when in sum we should be treating something on the order of 80.000 drug addicts. 30.000 presently in the service who will soon be discharged. and 50.000 veterans.
i appreciate the gentlemans comments. i understand the progress that has been made with reference to the veterans program. but let me just read from a recent report to the congress. given in testimony on january 27. 1970. by dr. douglas j. stewart. a doctor at the va hospital in miami. before a senate subcommittee on veterans affairs: i have often stood at a patients bedside. watching him vomit large amounts of blood and attempting to keep him alive while waiting for transfusible blood unnecessarily delayed in processing due to lack of clerical help. transporters. and laboratory personnel. i have waited as long as three hours for olood that in an adequately staffed hospital is made available in 30 minutes . . . i have had many patients with heart attacks situated in rooms with the latest. modern devices for monitoring heart beat. rhythm and rate. but have seen this possibly life. saving equipment left unused due to lack of personnel ... there is often only one nurse responsible for 40 acutely ill patients. if an emergency develops. the other 39 patients may go unseen for an hour or more. to have two emergency situations develop on a ward at the same time. a  infrequent occurrence. can only be described as utter. tragic chaos." . it is hing short of disgraceful that such conditions are permitted to exist. surely we canand shoulddo better for our veterans. we have the power to improve the quality of medical care in the va hospital system. and in my judgment we will be derelict if we do  take immediate meaningful steps to do so. the additional medical personnel to which i have referred will be needed to give the va system a minimum acceptable staffing ratio of two fulltime hospital employees for each patient in general hospitals. and one fulltime employee for each patient in neuropsychiatric hospitals. as the committee report accompanying this bill es. the present staffing ratio for general medical and surgical beds is only 1.59 to 1. and the appropriations contained in this bill are expected to raise that ratio to only 1.74 to 1. although this represents an improvement of 14 percent over the past 2 years. by way of comparison. the comparable ratio in private sector hospitals is 2.72 to 1. clearly the va is operating with insufficient resources. and equally clearly. i think. we in the congress have an obligation to give the va and the veterans the resources they need. and bear in mind that with the greatly expanded drug treatment program  being developed by the va. the need for more medical personnel is all the more acute. in proposing to add $100 million to the appropriation bill before us. it is my intention and hope that this would be used principally to hire those additional medical personnel needed to bring va medical care to something approaching what it ought to be. the amount i propose is a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of hiring these additional personnel. it is a large figure. but larger than the problem itself. some might say we can afford to spend that much. i say we can afford  to spend it. we are talking about the very lives and health of hundreds of thousands of our citizens.
and would the gentleman  agree that the committee should continue to try to get additional personnel so.that those soldiers who have served their country so well can receive the proper hospital treatment.
. i rise to lend my strong support for h.r. 9265. the veterans drug treatment act. the magnitude of the drug problem among our veterans. particularly those returned from vietnam. makes it imperative that we act without delay. it has been estimated by the va that- 50.000 of the nations 200.000 drug addicts are veterans. my guess is that both these figures are underestimated. and certainly they fail to take into account the many thousands of servicemen in vietnam who are addicted to drugs and who will soon become veterans. nevertheless. it is clear that the va has a major role to play in the treatment of drug addiction in our country. the law presently bars many veterans from receiving va medical treatment for narcotics addiction. veteran who has been discharged under "dishoable" conditions is eligible. yet. in 1970 the army awarded a total of 2.295 undesirable. bad conduct. and dishoable discharges for drug abuse offenses alone. here are nearly 2.300 potential or actual addicts disqualified from medical treatment. also disqualified are the many additional thousands of veterans who may have been discharged under dishoable conditions for reasons unrelated to drug abuse. a second disqualifier under present law is the requirements that a disability be "serviceconnected" in order for the veteran to be eligible for initial outpatient medical care. drug addiction is invariably  serviceconnected as that term is defined by statute. thus even thousands of hoably discharged veterans who become addicted to drugs are largely unable to receive the necessary treatment. such a policy makes sense at a time when drug addiction is a pervasive and destructive illness in our society. to deny a person access to medical treatmenttreatment beneficial  only to the individual but also very much so to the communityis selfdefeating and unenlightened. the bill before us removes these legal barriers and permits all addicted veterans to be treated by the va. regardless of the character of their discharge or the origin of their addiction. this is a major step forward. and one. incidentally. which i have been urging for some time. chairman teague and the committee are to be commended for taking this prompt and meaningful action to meet the drug addiction problem among our veterans. and i wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to vote for h.r. 9265.
to facilitate a eck on this disease. i wrote the secrey of hew to request information on s matter. although the report he sent from the social security administran says that there is. and i quote "some ity medical opinion to the effect at the disabling pneumoconiosis may ist in the absence of positive xray evince thereof." the social security adnistration objects to the test referred above because they think it is too comcated. requiring too much medical exrtise to be widely used. and yet the fact that whether or  it is complicated it being used in various parts of the untry and it is showing the existence black lung where xray failed to do so. apparently the social security adminration objects to new tests simply beuse they might be too complicated. or ore complicated than their present actice of just taking a picture. i might add that in pennsylvania. here decent medical facilities for examations are available. 69 percent of the plications for benefits have been apoved. on the contrary. only 28 percent ave been approved in kentucky and aly 44 percent in west virginia. in sum. is unfair to penalize a coal miner or is widow in kentucky or west virginia mply because medical facilities and etailed records are unavailable. i say that coal miners. who risk their yes almost daily. are entitled to the best medical tests.  the cheapest or asiest.
that is what i said. the gentleman is correct. we have spent $1 billion on research on education. but is the gentleman aware that we have spent in the same period $7 billion in research on agriculture. and $14 billion on health research. and the aircraft industry alone spends about $5 billion on research each year. should we  spend at least that on education.
. i rise in opposition to * the amendment and state at the outset that there is a difference of opinion on this question. i have sought both through the secretary of health. education. and * welfare. elliot richardson. and the bureau of disability insurance. to try to get to the truth of the matter. let me * report to the members from the report the secretary sent to me. and i will read just one section. this report stated: there is some miity medical opinion to the effect that disabling pneumoconiosis may exist in the absence of positive xray evidence thereof. further. the secretary. in this report he has sent to me. pointed out: we are currently carrying out a pilot project in conjunction with the public health service to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of developing a simplified exercise test for individuals who have "simple" pneumoconiosis but whose ventilatory capacity does  demonstrate total disability on the basis of conventional pulmonary function tests. the project is expected to lead the way to establishing additional methods and criteria for evaluating total disability. the doctor they have selected to participate in this test is dr. rasmussen. whom i have been in touch with both on the phone and in writing. he says there are tests that can detect total disability. that is complicated pneumoconiosis. that is serious. that does  show up on xrays. that can be made by drawing blood samples and determining the amount of oxygen in the blood of an individual as he runs on a treadmill. dr. rasmussen strongly feels that using xrays alone is a mistake and a grave injustice. and that while xrays will show some black lung. it has been proven that they do  always register the existence of black lung. therefore. i am urging that other professional diagtic techniques and approaches be allowed by the federal government in order to determine these benefits.
i appreciate the gentlemans comment. but he did  have in his possession the analysis of the secretarys document from dr. rasmussen. who had been asked by the department to be part of the study. he said in this analysis thatthe continuing reference to "majority medical opinion" or "prevailing medical judgment" impunes the integrity of the medical profession and implies gross incompetence among specialists in pulmonary diseases. it might be well to offer some parallels in the pseudoscience of medicine which could impart some degree of understanding into the problems of diagis of occupational lung diseases. in the diagis of. for example. peptic ulcer of the duodenum. it is fully recognized by virtually every member of the medical profession that an absolute diagis may  be made in the absence of xray evidence or anatomic evidence. however. it is kn that in perhaps 20% of patients suffering from severe peptic ulcer. the xray may  be diagtic. few qualified physicians. would. on the basis of negative xray evidence. fail to (a) diage the disease and (b) treat the patient as though he had a peptic ulcer in light of the patients symptoms. in the same light. in a patient whose symptoms strongly suggest a heart attack. the electrocardiogram may  be diagtic. the electrocardiogram may  reveal evidence of a definite heart attack in perhaps 5 to 10% of affected subjects. qualified physician would dismiss the patient or fail to treat him as if he had suffered a heart attack. until additional studies were performed. in establishing a diagis of active tuberculosis of the lung. physician in the entire world would be willing to say the disease did  exist if one. two or three examinations of the patients sputum failed to reveal mycobacterium tuberculosis. in fact. the diagis might well be made and the patient given therapy. in spite of the fact that an absolute diagis was  proven. these departures from the subject of "black lung" are made in order to attempt to understand the peculiar emohasis placed on the diagis of occupational lung disease in the united states. the same medical profession which makes diages of peptic ulcer. myocardial infarction and pulmonary tuberculosis. makes diages of occupational lung disease. objective. informed member of the medical profession would suggest that the chest xray has greater validity in diaging occupational lung disease than the gi xray in diaging peptic ulcer. the ecg in diaging myocardial infarction or the sputum examination in diaging tuberculosis. the point which. in my opinion. is crucial. is that the tenacious clinging to xray evidence of pneumoconiosis is medicolegal.  medical. it is a conditioned reflex. resulting from the impact of judicial and legalistic actions.  scientific medical judgment. the fact that the united states public health service currently uses xrays "to establish the presence of pneumoconiosis". is hardly a valid argument. and hardly portrays that agency as anything more than a rubber stamp for a regressive administration. the statement in paragraph 1 on page 2 is totally without foundation in any published or unpublished medical report. it implies. in fact. that xray evidence of cwp identifies a miners occupation as being responsible for his "bronchitis. emphysema. and a variety of neurological. infectious. muscular and degenerative diseases". i challenge the statement that the prevalent medical judgment places this reliance on the chest xray. in other words. one of the experts called in differs as to making the xray the sole basis for the judgment.
 nixons task force on aging in 1970 recommended the following: the task force believes that programs can be designed which  only provide adequate nutrition to older persons. but equally important. combat their loneliness. channel them into the community. and educate them about proper nutrition and afford some of them an opportunity for paid community service. this program has  been developed hastily. over the past few years there has been developed a very sound research and demonstration effort in the administration on aging to develop good models for these nutritional programs. currently. some 19 of these demonstration projects are being funded around the nation. all of these projects are designed with a particular goal in mindto overcome the social problems underlying inadequate diets among older people. they test techniques for nutrition programs that  only may improve diet but also enhance selfesteem and selfreliance. all aim at providing: a reaching out into the community to locate those most in need. building nutrition education into the project. providing a variety of ancillary social services. and establishing a means for systematic and objective evaluation. it is my judgment that. based on this research and demonstration effort. we have proceeded in a fashion all too rare in governmentwhich is to thoroughly field test a concept under varying conditions before it is put into operation. we are embarking. then. upon a course of action which we have every reason to believe will produce the desired results. we are presently supporting under the regular program operations of the administration on aging. some 112 nutritional programs of group meals and home delivered meals for the elderly. however. these are relatively small and scattered operations. there is room for doubt concerning the need for a greatly increased effort. particularly for the elderly poor. and. we must squarely face the fact that our older population is essentially a lowincome group. using the poverty guidelines developed by the social security administration. in 1968. 4.6 million persons aged 65 or olderor about onequarter of all older personslived in households with a total income below the poverty line. the bill  before the house is centered upon the problem of inadequate nutrition. but it is really far broader in its scope. while centering upon nutrition. it provides a perfect vehicle for attacking related problems of loneliness. physical isolation from the community. and inadequate social services which threaten the quality of life. and in some cases. life itself. it has a central purpose of helping more elderly people maintain a life of independence and dignity outside an institution. i think that this is highly desirable.  only in humane terms. but in terms of cost in tax dollars. even the very best institutional care is  a desirable alternative to independent living where that is possible. and even inadequate institutional care is vastly more expensive than the kinds of programs such as this which assist the elderly to live independently. in a nation of abundant agricultural resources it is sad indeed that we should speak today of hunger and malnutrition among our nations senior citizens. the bill before the house today represents a clear effort to meet this problem head on. authorities in the field of geriatrics continually emphasize the importance of nutrition as preventative medicine for the elderlypreventative medicine which will help them maintain good health and thus also some measure of selfsufficiency. s. 1163 would certainly be a significant step toward achieving these goals. . i urge that we give overwhelming support to this urgently needed program.
. i would like to say to my colleague. the gentleman from missouri . that i very much appreciate the interest and initiative that the gentleman has shown in the development of this program. the gentleman has held some significant hearings in his subcommittee on government operations. i would say to the gentleman that i share his convictions. and his hope that this program will help in a medical sense to prevent the kind of debilitation that occurs to our senior citizens. and perhaps relieving arthritis. and other illnesses which might be aggravated by nutritional deficiencies. i believe this significant initiation by the white house reflects its commitment to the white house conference on the aging. and i hope therefore that we can start to make meaningful progress in this area for our senior citizens who clearly and desperately need our help.
 will sign it in order that crucial services may be provided to the handicapped. before closing there are two questions which i should like to pose to the chairman of the subcommittee which i think might clarify the debate. first. the question has arisen in regard to title iii. as to whether there is any duplication with h.r. 1. it is my understanding that the provisions for endstage renal disease in h.r. 1 only apply after 90 days and only for those who are over 65 and are eligible therefor. or under 65 but disabled. is it  true that there are thousands who need help long. long before they are totally disabled. and. did  the subcommittee hear testimony that perhaps 20.000 to 25.000 people might have been saved had these rehabilitative services been available. i will repeat. they would  be available completely under h.r. 1.
. i would like to make special mention of several important components of this bill contained in title iispecial federal responsibilities. first. is a provision for research and training in the field of vocational rehabilitation. particular emphasis is placed on efforts to bring together in biomedical engineering projects the talents of scientists and engineers to advance prosthetic and other mobility devices. second. is a provision which establishes a program for spinal cord injury research. to include support of spinal cord injury projects and demonstrations. this program. established with the recommendations of dr. howard rusk. director of the new york university institute of rehabilitative medicine. hopefully will make it possible to bring under control. the  largely fragmented efforts in the restoration of victims of this severely disabling condition. third is a program for endstage renal disease research including support of projects and demonstrations for providing special services. artificial kidneys and supplies necessary for the rehabilitation of individuals suffer.ing from such disease. with regard to this program. let me also mention that this will  be duplicative of care provided under h.r. 1. last years social security amendments. end state renal disease coverage under medicare only applies after 90 days and only for those who are over 65 and eligible or under 65 but disabled. there are literally thousands of individuals in this country who need help long before they are totally disabled. in addition. the subcommittee during hearings heard testimony that as many as 25.000 people. including thousands in new york might have been saved had this service been available. further. provisions are made in the bill to insure that duplications will occur when such service is provided under other authority. the handicapped in our society have been neglected far too long. this legislation provides them with perhaps their only opportunity to return to a productive life. let us . in the name of false ecoies. continue this neglect.
. i have introduced today a bill which would extend the march 31. 1966. deadline relative to medicare through august 31. 1966. and provide that anyone who files during any month within the allowed period will have coverage from the first day of the following month. under the present law those persons who reached the age of 65 in 1965 or earlier were required to enroll in the medicare program by march 31. 1966. in order to be eligible for the medicare benefits. the office of the social security commissioner informs me that there are 19 million eligible for medicare. but only 16 million have signed up for the program. of the remaining. 1 million have declined to enroll and 2 million have  been heard from. it is my view that those who have  yet enrolled should  be penalized and miss the benefits of the program because of an arbitrary deadline. moreover. aher 1 million persons. who declined to participate in medicare. should be given ample time to reconsider. the social security commissioner reports that about 500.000 men and women who first declined enrollment in the medicare program. later changed their minds.
. on march 17. 1966. i introduced a series of four bills designed to combat and control the shocking problem of drug addiction and drug abusers which seriously affects new york city and the nation. today. i have introduced a bill designed to fight an equally severe problemalcoholism. my bill would provide for a comprehensive program of research together with federal grantsinaid to the states for the treatment. rehabilitation. education. and prevention of alcoholism. under the bill. an office of alcoholism control under the surgeon general would be established to administer a program of matching grants to the states. in addition. the office of alcoholism control would administer a program of research. training. and demonstration projects to universities and other institutions and would coordinate various alcoholic programs presently conducted by different agencies. the bill provides for a nineman alcoholism advisory council for the purpose of advising the director of the office of alcoholism control and to review project grants and programs of the office. moreover. the council would have the power to make recommendations on dealing with alcoholism. senator jacob k. javits. of new york. who has recently introduced legislation in this field in the senate. is keenly aware of the need for federal help in this area. senator javits. recognizing alcoholism as the fourth most serious health problem in the united states. stated on january 25. 1966: there are an estimated 5 to 6 million alcoholics in the nationi out of every 15 americans who drink. roughly. 250.000 persons each year join the ranks of alcoholics. * * * alcoholism is a major menace. yet while we expend some $380 annually to treat each tuberculosis patient. only 16 cents is spent on the average each year for treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics. it is a kn fact that alcoholism shortens life. alcoholics have a death rate two and onehalf times that of the mal population. there are 70 million people in this country who drink. drinking presents problem to some 65 million of these. but. according to the national council on alcoholism. inc.. as to an estimated 5.015.000 of them drinking has become egh of a problem to interfere with successful. happy "living. these are the alcoholics. i define the term "alcoholic" to mean any person who chronically and habitually uses or is dependent upon alcoholic beverages to the extent that he has lost power of selfcontrol with respect to use of such beverages or who by reason of alcoholism endangers the health. safety. or welfare of himself or others. contrary to general belief. the great majority of the alcoholic population of 5.015.000 is  the visible skidrow type of alcoholic found in the monday morning lineups. on the bowery. in the jails. and in the city hospitals. some 97 percent of all alcoholics are to be found in the homes. factories. offices. and communities of america. there are many disastrous effects of alcoholism which are  easily reflected and appreciated by a perusal of alcoholic statistics. for example. what of the family of the afflicted individual. it is  possible for the breadwinner of the family to become afflicted with the disease of alcoholism without the entire family unit feeling the impact. in most cases where the father or mother or both are victims of alcoholism. there is a total breakdown in the family unit concept. children are faced with the ruins. they are left to shift for themselves. it is  surprising that so many children of alcoholics become delinquents and eventually alcoholics themselves. in aher sense. alcoholism is highly impractical in that it is extremely costly. there have been conservative estimates that the cost to business and industry from absenteeism. inefficiency. and accidents resulting from alcoholism rates as high as $2 billion annually. in addition. the loss of valuable personnel who fall victims to alcoholism after years of investment in their training is costing industry an astroical amount every year.  to mention the $432 million per annum reflected in lost wages because of absenteeism resulting from alcoholism. withstanding the dreadful consequences of alcoholism. relatively little governmental effort or money has been expended to deal with this problem. efforts in the states. while helpful. have  met the need. the majority of the states have taken the significant legislative step of recognizing alcoholism as a medical problem and have provided some state funds for alcoholic treatment. education. and research. the fact remains. however. that the states need federal help badly. for example. in new york state alone it is estimated that there are currently 700.000 alcoholics. and yet new york states budget . although high by comparison. is approximately $1 million. the new york state mental hygiene department presently operates 2 alcoholic treatment units in new york state hospitals. a 70bed unit at central islip. long island. and one for 60 patients in rochester. n.y. both are for men only. the department plans to establish 3 more units this year. a womens unit at central islip and two more for men. one in new york city and aher upstate. the department hopes ultimately to establish a treatment unit in each of the 19 state hospitals. in addition to financial problems. it must have trained personnel such as recreational and occupational therapists and psychologists. the alcoholic problem is of concern to the nation and of palticular concern to new york city. the city has the largest number of alcoholics in the country. some 258.000. as of 1963. and the number is on the rise. most of them. according to the national council on alcoholism. are receiving treatment whatsoever. the time has come for a comprehensive federal program to deal with alcoholism. we must provide substantial money. aid. and support to the states to assist them in strengthening their present programs and initiating new ones. this bill. i believe. would be a major step in that direction. i include a copy of the bill: h.r. 14197 a bill to provide for a comprehensive program for the control of alcoholism be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the "alcoholism control act of 1966".
. today i have introduced a bill to permit all patients currently using the drug. krebiozen. to purchase the same in illis or elsewhere for use in any state. at the present time there are several cancer patients in my district who have used krebiozen. are currently using krebiozen. and who wish to continue to do so. it seems to me that cancer patients currently using krebiozen should  be required to undergo additional expense to travel to illis to purchase the drug. i am  unaware of the doubts which a great many doctors and government agency officials have concerning the effectiveness of the drug.  am i persuaded to believe that krebiozen is an authentic cancer cure. the fact remains. however. that withstanding the lack of governmental approval of the drug. there has been clear and convincing proof that the drug is in any way harmful. as long as it is  used as a substitute for necessary xray or surgery. moreover. many patients earnestly believe that their health and even their lives depend on its continued use. research. study. and testing continue with the hopein which we all sharethat someday in the very near future a cure may be found for cancer. until then. or at least until there is a clear showing that the administration of krebiozen is harmful to the patient in any way. i can agree that those who believe it to be beneficial and who have actually used it. should be deprived of it in the future. we can play at being the deity and neither can the food and drug administration. a copy of the bill follows: h.r. 14322 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that all patients currently using the drug krebiozen be permitted to purchase same in illis or elsewhere for use in any state.
. :my bill would amend section 213 of the internal revenue code of 1954 to restore the medical expense deductions previously allowed the taxpayer. 65 years of age or over. without regard to the 3percent and 1percent floor. when the house committee on ways and means reported the social security amendments act of 1965house report.  213. 89th congress. 1st session. pages 136139it terminated the present special treatment of medical expensessee section 213(a) (b). internal revenue code of 1954of taxpayers who are 65 or over on the theory that they would receive adequate reimbursement for their medical expenses under medicare. moreover. the argument was advanced that restoration of a uniform medical expense deduction rulemaking distinction in the tax treatment of those persons 65 or overwould simplify the administration of the tax law by eliminating the need for a special tax form for taxpayers 65 or over. as the law  stands. those taxpayers 65 years of age or over will  receive. after december 31. 1966. as favorable tax treatment as they would have under the prior. more liberal law. withstanding medicare. section 213 of the internal revenue code does  allow as a deduction those expenses compensated by insurance or otherwise. the point is. however. that there are several expenses including the cost of drugs which are  reimbursed under medicare and are  allowed as a deduction. except to the extent that they exceed the 1percent and 3percent limitations. moreover. medical expenses are only partially covered under medicare in certain cases. for example. after the first day of hospitalization medicare will pay the following 60 days. and onefourth of the expenses of the next 30 days. if necessary. should an illness persist. however. as unfortunately many chronic or catastrophic illnesses do. beyond 90 days. then the patient must bear the expense alone. when the cost of drugs is added to a prolonged convalescence at home it can be readily seen why the medical costs which are  compensated for by medicare or other insurance and the cost of drugs should be fully deductible where the taxpayer is 65 year of age or over. when the senate finance committee considered the house version of the social security amendments of 1965. it indicated the desirability of retaining the more liberal tax treatment originally afforded the taxpayer 65 years of age or over. by striking out the 1percent and 3percent limitations on medical expense deductionssenate finance committee. report  404. part i. pages 528529. 89th congress. 1st session. when the final bill emerged from conference. however. the 1percent and 3percent limitations contained in the house bill remained substantially intact. section 106 of the social security amendments of 1965public law 8997--contains the ipercent and 3percent floor and provides that more than $150 of expenses paid for insurance may be deducted. the present tax law should be amended to restore the benefits which were given to those 65 years of age or over under prior law and which have  been taken away by the social security act amendments of 1965. i urge this great body to give serious consideration to my bill which would provide deductions without the 1percent and 3percent floor for medical expenses  otherwise compensated for by medicare or other insurance and would thereby give assistance to those who need it most. medicare was supposed to assist the elderly. this tax change actually was a step backward for those over 65. and they should have their medical and drug tax deductions restored. the text of the bill i am introducing follows: a bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to provide that medical expenses incurred for the care of certain individuals who are 65 years of age or over may be deducted without regard to the 3percent and 1cent floors be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that section 213(a) of the internal revenue code of 1954 (relating to allowance of deduction for medical. dental. etc.. expenses) is amended to read as follows: "(a) allowance of deduction.-there shall be allowed as a deduction"(1) (a) if neither the taxpayer  his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. an amount equal to the following (reduced by any amount deductible under paragraph (2)): "(i) the amount of the expenses paid during the taxable year ( compensated for by insurance or otherwise) for medical care of any dependent (as defined in section 152) who"(a) is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse. and "(b) has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. plus "(ii) the amount by which the expenses paid during the taxable year ( compensated for by insurance or otherwise) for medical care of the taxpayer. his spouse. and his dependents (as defined in section 152). other than any dependent described in clause (i). exceed 3 percent of the adjusted gross income: .or "(b) if either the taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. an amount equal to the following (reduced by any amount deductible under paragraph (2)) : "(1) the amount of the expenses paid during the taxable year ( compensated for by insurance or otherwise) for medical care of the taxpayer and his spouse. and "(ii) the amount of such expenses for medical care of any dependent described in subparagraph (a) (i). and "(iii) the amount by which such expenses for medical care of the taxpayers dependents (as defined in section 152) other than any dependent described in subparagraph (a) (i) exceed 3 percent of the adjusted gross income. and "(2) an amount ( in excess of $150) equal to onehalf of the expenses paid during the taxable year for insurance which constitutes medical care for the taxpayer. his spouse. and dependents." (b) clause (2) of the second sentence in section 213(b) (relating to limitation with respect to medicine and drugs) is amended by striking out "subsection (a)(1).(a)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (a)(1) (a) (i)". (c) the amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after sec. 2. subsections (a) and (b) of section 106 of the social security amendments of 1965 are repealed.
member of congress. congress of the united states. house of representatives. washington. d.c. dear mr. kupferman: i am writing to thank you for your letter of 10 may to the secretarygeneral in which you were kind egh to inform him about the legislation you have introduced into congress about the effects of se upon human beings. i share your preoccupation with this growing problem. and it is indeed one with which the united nations family of organizations. ably the world health organization. is already concerned. as you doubt k who published in 1965 a report of an expert committee on the environmental health aspects of metropolitan planning and development. which contained a section on se and vibration. who also proposes to publish a report later this year on "occupational se" and is engaged on a separate study of the health aspects of vibration. these activities are. i believe. a sign that the world community is becoming more aware of these problems. with kind regards. yours sincerely.
. on august 9. 1966. i introduced a bill to provide that plans and regulations established pursuant to section 10 of the federal water pollution control act for the control of water pollution shall apply to vessels including boats and marinas. a copy of my statement and bill apaugust 9. 1966. at pages 18745 and 18746. the model law. however. prepared by the outboard boating club of america. and referred to in my statement. was inadvertently omitted at the end of my statement and bill. i would like  to include a copy of the model act to regulate littering and disposal of untreated sewage prepared for the pollution study committee of the national association of state boating law administrators. a copy of the model law follows: a model act to pronnirr lntterxa and the disposal of untreated sewage from boats an act to regulate the disposal of sewage from watercraft and to prohibit littering of waterways section 1. defnvntions.-for purposes of this act. unless the context clearly requires a different meaning: (a) the term "watercraft" means any contrivance used or capable of being used for navigation upon water whether or  capable of selfpropulsion. except passenger or cargocarrying vessels subject to the interstate quarantine regulations of the united states public health service adopted pursuant to title 42 united states code § 241 and (b) the term "sewage" means all human body wastes. . (c) the term "litter" means any bottles. glass. crockery. cans. scrap metal. junk. paper. garbage. rubbish. or similar refuse discarded as longer useful or useable. (d) the term "marine toilet" means any toilet on or within any watercraft to discharge waste. (e) the term "waters of this state" means all of the waterways on which watercraft shall be used or operated. (e.-in some states it may be desired to limit the application of this act to certain waters only and thereby exempt large bodies of water or water areas that are remote from population centers and on which there is congestion and conceivable boat pollution problem. the waters subject to pollution control under this act could be enumerated or the state agency which is designated to administer the act could be authorized to make a finding that a particular waterway should or should  be affected.) (f) the term "person" means an individual. partnership. firm. corporation. association. or other entity. (g) the term "department" means the (name of the state agency which shall administer this act).

. medicarethe medicare act. public law 8997was supposed to help people. in my statement found at pages 11140may 23. 1966. on my bill h.r. 15213. i pointed out the serious deficiency created by this law with respect to medical tax deductions for people over 65. other problems have also been raised. one has to do with the reimbursement formula with respect to nursing homes. an analysis of this problem is set forth by irwin r. karassik. esq.. of the new york bar in the september 1966 issue of nursing home news published by the new york state nursing home association. inc. the analysis follows:

. on monday night. march 13. i had the ho of addressing the society of medical jurisprudence on the subject of "se pollution." the meeting was held at the einhorn auditorium of the le hill hospital in my district in new york city the program of the evening follows:
. the mutual educational and cultural exchange act of 1961public law 87256provides. among other things. for visits to the united states by students. trainees. teachers. professors. research workers. and leaders in fields of specified kledge or skill. the purpose of this act is to increase mutual understanding through educational and cultural exchange between the people of the united states and the people of other countries. while at the same time promoting international cooperation for educational and cultural advancement. a considerable number of aliens have entered this country pursuant to the foreign exchange visitors program to receive sophisticated training as medical doctors. nurses. and aids. many of these aliens would  be able to receive comparable training in the hospitals and medical institutions of their homeland. to avoid the foreign exchange program being used as a back door for immigration. the cultural exchange act provides that person admitted under this program shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa or for permanent residence. or for a immigrant visa until such person has residedphysically presentin the country of his nationality or his last residence. or in aher foreign country. for an aggregate of at least 2 years following his departure from the united states after his trainingpublic law 87256. section 101(a) 15(j). 101(a)15(h). a waiver of this 2year foreign residence requirement may be obtained in certain circumstances. under the law. upon favorable recommendation of the secretary of state. and pursuant to the request of an interested u.s. agency. such as hew. the 2year foreign residence requirement may be waived by the attorney general in the case of any alien whose admission to the united states is found by the attorney general to be in the public interest. the department of health. education. and welfare. which receives a large number of applications for waiver of the 2year foreign residence requirement. in conjunction with the department of state. which has general responsibility for administration of the exchange program. has promulgated stringent guidelines and a restrictive policy with respect to waiver requests. under present policy there are only two cases in which waivers would appear to be permitted. the first category consists of cases in which waivers are sought because the exchange visitors have training or skills which are in short supply in the united states and are deemed to be of benefit to the entire country. the second category includes cases in which private institutions maintain that their programs of teaching. research. and medical treatment would be greatly jeopardized if they could  retain certain exchange visitors indefinitely. as evidence of the stringent requirements presently exercised by the exchange visitor waiver review board under the department of health. education. and welfare. the following criteria are applied: first. the services of the individual must be needed in a highly important program or activity of national or international significance. waivers will  be favorably considered where the problem is primarily one of recruitment in order to overcome a local community or institutional manpower shortage. however serious. second. a direct relationship must exist between the individual and the program or activity involved so that the loss of his services would necessitate discontinuance of the program. or a major phase of it. waivers will  be granted when the principal problem appears to be one of administrative or program inconvenience to the institution or other employers. third. the individual must possess unusual and outstanding qualifications. training. and experience. waivers will  be favorably considered simply because an individual has specialized training or experience or is occupying a senior staff position. on ember 3. 1966. i wrote to mr. john w. gardner. secretary. department of health. education. and welfare. to explore the feasibility of relaxing the present stringent requirements with respect to waivers. in view of the critical shortage of medical manpower with which our hospitals and medical institutions are faced today. on ember 21. 1966. i received a reply to my letter to secretary gardner from hew under secretary wilbur j. cohen. a copy of which follows: dear mr. kupfer1van: this is in reference to your recent communications relating to relaxing the criteria for waivers of the twoyear foreign residence requirement of the exchange visitor program for qualified doctors and nurses. you may be certain that the critical shortages of medical manpower is of great concern to the department of health. education. and welfare. however. these waiver requirements were established by consultation with the department of state and. unless the department is provided with different guidelines. it is the responsibility of the exchange visitor waiver review board to carry out these original mandates accordingly. this departments waiver review board is chaired by mr. shelton b. granger. deputy assistant secretary for international affairs. and memberships of the board include representatives from the public health service. the office of education. and the office of the secretary. this committee advises regularly with the officials of the department of state about problems such as the ones you have indicated which are taken into consideration in the establishment of the criteria under which the department functions. your interest is appreciated and i hope you will understand the many problems with which the board is faced in this complex and difficult matter. i again brought this matter to the attention of the department of state in a letter to dr. charles prankel. assistant secretary for educational and cultural affairs. the reply from the deputy assistant for educational and cultural affairs. katie louchheim. points up the dilemma in an intelligent way:
. s. dale furst. jr.. and executive director. earle lippincott. have furnished me with the findings of the joint statement by his american social health association in conjunction with the american public health association. the american venereal disease association. and the association of state and territorial health officers. on .the subject of "todays vd control problem." the list of membership on the committee statement is indeed an impressive one and follows:
. i am certain that the members of this body are vitally concerned about the problem of the disease of alcoholism in america today. on april 13. 1967. senators javits. of new york. and moss. of utah. together with 34 other senators. introduced s. 1508. kn as the alcoholism care and control act of 1967. their statement on it can be found in the congressional record of april 13. commencing at page 9322. i believe that their bill is worthy of support. and that a united partisan effort should be made for it in the house. i am joined in this behalf by 21 of my colleagues here in the house. we are taking advantage of the new provision under house resolution 42 adopted april pages 10708 through 10712which allows joint sponsorship by up to 25 members. i am. therefore. pleased that sponsoring the house version of s. 1508 today we have mr. addabbo. mr. bell. mr. button. mr. conte. mr. daniels. mr. fi mr. gonzalez. mr. halpern. mr. hanley. mr. mcclory. mr. mathias of maryland. mr. reid of new york. mr.
ial address given on april 10 in san francisco. entitled "physician. whither goest thou." contains some thoughtprovoking suggestions and conclusions on problems of health care for the future. and i am pleased to bring them to the attention of my colleagues.

 johnson. in expressing his shock and disappointment. pointed out the fact that this country spends large sums of money on protecting its domestic livestock from rodents and predatory animals. while denying the same advantage to the children of our nation. in addition to gover rockefellers proposal. i have received a letter from the state senator from the 48th district of florida (richard stone) who inform me that he is introducing a rat control act in his state legislature. the states. however. must have federal assistance so that a speedy nationwide solution to this problem can be assured. secretary weaver. testifying before the subcommittee on housing of the house committee on banking and currency. expressed the purposes of federal intervention when he stated: the principal difficulty in controlling and exterminating rats has been due primarily to the failure to allocate sufficient technical and financial resources to the problem. the conditions which breed rats as well as the techniques for removing these conditions are  wellkn. rat control and extermination programs undertaken under the provisions of the bill will emphasize control measures to eliminate places that shelter rats and their food supplies. as well as systematic extermination. as needed. cities will be helped in carrying out public education campaigns. appropriate training and information needed to secure the cooperation of the inhabitants of ratinfested areas will be supported... the program which would be authorized under this legislation will emphasize intensive action all its resources will be directed to the prob.. lem of rat control and extermination . . . building on the existing experience. we can help communities to eliminate the threat that rats constitute to health and safety of their citizens8 lawlessness. unemployment. low income. rats. substandard housing. race end class prejudice each form an integral part of the current urban crisis that is presently threatening our nations concept of liberty. rats. as pointed out in a task force report done under the auspices of the bureau of disease prevention and environmental control.

. the problems of medicaid have been so well considered by gov. nelson a. rockefeller. of my state of new york. in a recent speech at the govers conference at jackson hole. wyo.. that i thought it should be brought to the attention of my colleagues during the consideration of medical assistance payments under title iipublic welfare amendmentsof h.r. 12080 before us today. as i indicated in my remarks to the house on the adoption of the rulepage 22785--one unfortunate aspect of the adoption of a closed rule allowing amendments. was to prohibit to this committee the opportunity of giving effect to such sensible analyses as that given by gover rockefeller to this question. it may very well be that if an opportunity were available. there might be amendment to the bill h.r. 12080 to perfect and improve the provisions on medicaid. gover rockefellers remarks follow: excerpts of nemarks by gov. nelson a.
. inasmuch as se remains unconfined. i k my colleagues will be interested in the fact that on tuesday. september 12. at a luncheon meeting of the u.s. chamber of commerce at the sheratoncarlton hotel here in washington. there was a symposium on the "se pollution problem" under the auspices of the chambers national resources committee. reference to this meeting has heretofore been made in my address to the house on the subject of "se pollution revisited." on august 31. 1967. at pages 24844 to 24865. the meeting was covered. among .others. by the environmental health letter through its publisher gershon w. fishbein. and in its issue of september 15. reported as follows:
. i have long been concerned about the quality and quantity of medical care available in the united states. this country. in the forefront in its number of physicians and hospitals. and amount of equipment. with wonder drugs and great specialists. must etheless ponder the great gaps in health care that. unfortunately. are still to be foundand conditions worsen. a penetrating study of the problem in depth has just been written by richard d. lyons and published as front page news in the new york times of thursday. friday. and saturday. september 28. 29. and 30. and the titles "doctor shortage nearing a crisis." "foreign physicians. many unqualified. fill vacuum in the united states." and "fund woes beset medical schools." i commend these articles. which follow. for careful study by my colleagues: [from the new york times. sept. 28. 1967]
. my concern for the quality of health care in this country lead me on april 5. to introduce h.r. 8062. a bill to provide that in the administration of the immigration and nationality act certain immigration restrictions shall  apply to certain alien doctors and nurses participating in exchange programs. the bill would relax stringent application of the provisions of the cultural exchange act in order to allow qualified medical doctors and nurses to remain in this country to help alleviate our shortage of health personnel. my statement on april 5. 1967. at page 8470. and the legislative digest of the regan report on hospital law featured it in its april 1967 issuevolume 8.  1. more recently. the new york times discussed the problem of the foreign physician in a series by richard d. lyons. which i included in the congressional record under the general heading "health care in the united states" in the issue of october 5. commencing at page dr. charles m. poser. professor of neurology at the university of missouri school of medicine. kansas city division. who is vitally interested in this question. has brought to my attention an article entitled "why this foreign m.d. wont go home again." from the october 1967 issue of hospital physician. this article deserves analysis in the consideration of h.r. 8062 and i bring it to the attention of my colleagues along with dr. posers letter to me of october 18. as follows:

. as a patron of the arts. a foreign policy expert. a businessman. and a statesman in the finest sense of the word. truly a man for all seasons. however. i should like to call attention to what i think is your greatest achievement. and that is the time you spent fighting in the trenches. running the state of new york as gover for probably the longest term of anyone else. certainly in this century and extending back into the last century. some 14 years. as gover of that incredibly large state. you made government work. it seems to me that in washington. programs can be passed. in albany programs can be passed. but somebody has to make them work. and that devolves upon the gover in many instances. you ran an efficient and honest administration. but much more important than that. it seems to me that you thought about the future. you took the long view. when something had to be done about mass transportation. you thought about it and did something about it. you thought about the need for clean water and did something about it. you thought about the need for additional parks in the state. and you did something about it. so it went. for better medical care. for youth programs. on and onthings that touched the lives every day of the citizens of your state and touch them  only today but for years in the future. you have inspired the rest of us who have labored in the vineyard. out in the hustings. as senator dole mentioned. your incredible enthusiasm has lifted the spirit of all of us. you have been a steadfast friend who helped me when i ran for office. as well as many others. a host of other candidates. so on behalf of ginny and myself i extend to you. happy and the boys a seal harbor wish: may you always have a fair wind and a following sea.
. and says there is black lung disease. and there is way that the federal government can have aher reading. why. this is an open door to the treasury. it is amazing that they do  just send it in and say. "send us the check." the government has chance to read it and say. "yes. there is" or " there is ." the distinguished senator from kentucky has observed that this would  apply in cases of fraud. but fraud means that when you are sending in an xray for miner x. it is really an xray of miner y. it does  really go into the definition of whether or  there is black lung disease there. the local doctorand i must say i admire the distinguished senator from kentucky when he says that we are overlysuspicious to assume that a physician could. perhaps.  be right. but many physicians are  always right. i suggest that lawyers are  always right. and doctors are  always right. and maybe even senators are  always rightalthough i seriously doubt that
may i say in response. there are all kinds of review of medicare and medicaid programs. there are utilization review committees. there are all kinds of reviews. as we all k. however. one of the great problems with these programs is the scandals that have developed because there is inadequate review. it seems to me that the senator is citing  only a situation that is  quite as described. because there are checks. but. furthermore. the very programs that are in trouble because there are  adequate checks. finally. . let me just say finally. i have supported this bill. i have great admiration for the sponsor of the bill because. personally. i serve on two committees under his distinguished leadership. it always amazes me. when somebody has something that is pretty good. why they overreach. to me. this is one bridge too far. it just stretches the credulity and. i believe. the good judgment of the senate. if we go this far. that is why i have supported the amendment that has been proposed.
in the event that the government reader should determine that. based on his reading. there can be a determination of black lung disease. the situation does  end. . that oftentimes. when the government gets the xray under the present situation. it upgrades the award. in other words. it determines that the black lung disease is more serious than the original reader had expected. there is a further protection for the claimant in that. in 40 percent of the cases that were examined in 1975 under a study. the governments second reader found that there was previously undetected evidence of lung cancer. tuberculosis. and emphysema. what my amendment does is go back to the situation where we are . in other words. it protects the governments right to have a second reading and changes the proposed law. which would eliminate the right of the government. the taxpayers of this nation. the citizens of this nation. to have its second reading made prior to any benefit being paid.
. i do  think anybody could have sat through those hearings and listened to those very distinguished scientists. doctors. and research personnel without coming to. the conclusion that there is a potential danger in saccharin. the point that the senator from maine is a good onethat if we are going to warn people. let us do the best job we can. frankly. i think we are going the minimum distance. the senator from wisconsin desires that we completely abandon it or at least just have it over the counter. but there is so much strong sentiment from those who are diabetics and are on weight diets who ask that this be readily available that i think this is the minimum we can do to protect the health of our people. to give this warning through our media. i support the measure as it came from the subcommittee on health in the committee on human resources.
as the senator from nevada ks. as the former gover of a state. setting aside money for maintenance. particularly preventive maintenance. is one of the most difficult things a gover or any other executive has to do. because the money is there and it is up for grabs. let us postpone that new boiler for aher year. we do  want more trucks. we will get them next year. there is always this thrust to take money and use it  for schools or health or whatever it might be. there is question that that temptation exists. and that pressure will be on any executive who is running the canal. there is question about that.
. this amendment deals with the very subject that the senator from kansas dealt with previously. it is a technical amendment to the health education provision of this act. it simply assures that there will be coordination between the office of education and the public health service in planning these special health projects so that there will be duplication of effort. i have consulted with the floor managers. and they are in agreement with the amendment.
madam president. this deals with health education. one of the real tragedies of our society is we spend literally millions and billions on taking care of people when they get sick. but we do  seem to have any programs designed anywhere in the u.s. government to try and keep people healthy. this is the thrust. to educate the youngsters on keeping their health. eating decent foods. maintaining their physical fitness. staying away from drugs and abusive materials which are injurious to their health let us keep the people out of the hospitals. teach them the way to stay healthy. and the whole nation will be better off in the long run. for that reason i support the section as it emerged from the committee.
. earlier this year i introduced the national health incentives grants act of 1978 to assist state and local public health officials to expand their capabilities in the area of public health activities and disease prevention and health promotion. although this legislation we are  considering utilizes a more targeted approach. it retains the flexibility which i believe is essential for local public health officials to attack their unique problems. using methods which are most suitable to their own localities. the problems in massachusetts are  the same as those in alaska. the problems of rhode island are  the same as those of iowa. i would like to commend the distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee. senator kennedy. and the ranking republican member. senator schwenker. for their leadership and expertise in this important bill. this legislation combines several components in a prevention strategy and builds on existing systems. it provides a basic categorical bedrock of support for state and local public health departments to maintain their efforts in the traditional health protection areas. such as immunization. protection of the food and water supply. and other environmental activities which have been so successful in combating infectious diseases.
. usually i am on this floor teaming up with the distinguished senator from wisconsin. who is a true budget cutter and who has done so much to try to hold down spending of every kind. it seems to me we have to find a balance here. what senator pells amendment does is provide that we spend $15 million for 2 years--$7.5 million each year. what will we spend it for. we will spend it in an earnest effort to try to encourage physical fitness in this nation. that is a very modest amount. $7.5 million. to try and get over 200 million people to stay more physically fit and healthier. . the statistics are there and there is question about it. i think some interesting facts are in the report on this bill and i would recommend that everyone read it. particularly pages 42 and 43. some of the extraordinary results that can be achieved are documented in this report. i k the senator from wisconsin will agree with this. there is question that a modest amount of physical activity can go a long way in keeping people healthy. particularly in connection with cardiovascular and coronary heart disease. this has been shown by studies of busdrivers in london. they conducted a study on the difference between the busdriver who sits in a seat and drives the bus and the conductor going up and down the steps. it has been proven that the drivers have one and onehalf times the frequency of coronary heart disease as the conductors who go up and down the steps. this program is an attempt to keep people more physically fit. we might say that we can do it by voluntarism. well. the truth of the matter is that perhaps we can. but it is  egh. we are  reaching egh people. people just are  staying fit. take a look around. take a look at the capitol policemen. or whoever it may be. my goodness. i do  want to pick on the capitol policemen. but there is a good deal of overweight in the american people. we encourage voluntarism. and. basically. that is what this bill does. it is  to try to do it all. it is to encourage these states to take a more active role and try to establish their own programs. i join with senator pell in urging that the senate reject the move by the senator from wisconsin and keep this modest program. let us try to do something in this whole area of preventive medicine. i thank the senator.
. i rise to join in sponsorship of and in support of the amendment which the senior senator from massachusetts has proposed. it seems to me what is taking place in cambodia is really one of the great tragedies of our lifetime. apparently a whole nation. the population of a whole nation. is in danger of being eliminated. and whatever we can do and as fast as we can do it we should do it and. hopefully. this amendment by the senator from massachusetts and others will help in some way. hopefully a large way. to accomplish the rescue of this tragic people suffering from disease and sicknesses unlike anything we have ever kn before. at least in recent times.
to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate agrees to the amendment of the house to a bill of the senate of the following title: s. 1625. an act to amend the act of december 20. 1944. as amended. the message also annced that the vice president. and upon the recommendation of the miity leader. pursuant to the provisions of section 276 of title 22. united states code. as amended by public law 9545. appointed mr. pressler to attend the interparliamentary union conference. to be held in berlin. east germany. september 1624. the message also annced that the senate disagrees to the amendments of the house to the bill entitled "an act entitled the health sciences promotion act of 1980." requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. kennedy. mr. williams.
. it is unfortunate that the senate did  act on the chap bill this year. however. i want to assure my departing colleagues that there are many senators who will serve in the next session of congress including this one who share their concern about improved health care for lowincome mothers and children. we must restructure federal health care programs to emphasize preventive care. and one of the best places to start is with women and children. the child health assurance program would have done this. however. the fiscal constraints we face this year. and will continue to face. make it extremely difficult to create new programs. or to expand old ones. but i believe we must place the health of mothers and children at the top of our list of priorities. we will need to find inative ways to restructure these programs. to eliminate wasted efforts. and focus on those which are most effective. we must make our scarce dollars stretch further. and one of the most effective ways to do this is through preventive services for mothers and their children. i intend to use my best efforts to improve health care services for lowincome women and children. and to build on the improvements and the work which has been accomplished over the years.
. i think it is time that we took a more serious look at the whole agent orange issue. especially as it pertains to health care for vietnam veterans who claim their disabilities resulted from exposure to this chemical which was widely used during the vietnam war. in my judgment. senator cranstons amendment  59 breaks important new ground in legislating a sound approach to this whole issue. i strongly support this approach. and urge my colleagues to do the same.
. this amendment will serve to correct any unfortunate misimpression that the united states is unconcerned about the health of the worlds poorest children. infant mortality throughout the third world has reached epidemic proportions. today .21 young children die every minute throughout the developing countries from hunger related causes. primarily diarrhea and other infectious diseases. this amendment merely states what is the preponderant view of the medical profession and the scientific communitythat breastfeeding is a nutritional source of uncontaminated food which also provides necessary protection against potentially deadly diseases faced by young children in develoning countries. by doing so. this amendment will hopefully clear up any misinterpretation thatmight lead to the conclusion that breastfeeding is. in any way. an inferior food source. there is also an undeniable danger that reliance upon infant formula in areas where safe and sterile formula preparation is  possible. can result in widespread infant diarrheathe largest single cause of infant deaths in the poorest regions of the third world. under such circumstances. it is only prudent that governments consider ways to control excessive promotional practices. it is here as well that this amendment is designed to correct any misimpression by stating the intent of the congress  to discourage other countries from adopting standards to protect the health of their citizens. finally. this amendment urges greater efforts to improve sanitation and water quality thereby bringing about healthier infant feeding practices where mothers can  or choose  to breast feed. this country cares deeply about the worlds poor and their children. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment which will send the message clearly and unambiguously that we are concerned.
. i would like to speak to my colleague from kansas about those sections of the reconciliation report and bill which deal with medicaid and the qualification of a states cost control program. this is of particular concern to my state of rhode island.
. my colleague. from kansas. the distingiushed chairmai. of the finance committee. has correctly st..ted that rhode island was a pioneer in th.. development of prospective reimbursemtnt systems. as a direct result of my statelt: program. rhode island has been extremely successful in controlling medicaid costs. it is one of the most costeffective programs in the country. therefore. it is appropriate. and the intention of the finance committee conferees. that rhode islands program  be excluded from qualification for the 1 percent reimbursement which my colleague from kansas has described. because of the small size of my state. our medicaid administrators. blue cross officials. and hospital association representatives have been able to work together effectively. chapter 208. title 27 of the general laws of rhode island. does create the framework for direct state participation in any prospective reimbursement system. and indeed. the state is directly involved in the operation of that system.
. i join my distinguished colleague from arkansas in introducing an amendment to restore funding for the maternal and child health care block grant. fiscal responsibility has been our guide this year. we have had to make painful cuts in valuable programs in an effort to tame federal spendingall with the aim of returing vitality to the nations ecoy. a h~ealthy ecoy is critically important. so is a healthy population. adequately funding maternal and child health will contribute to both. the maternal and child health care block grant suffered emous cuts earler this year. in 1981. the program was funded t . $456 million. yet. it was authorized at just $373 million in the reconciliation package. . the senate 4pprq4rp±91a p0pm4ttqq and house of
 held a signing ceremony in the rose garden to commemorate the great feat that had taken place. and the great feat that had taken place is that decemnber 16. 1981 they opened wide the doors of the treasury of the united states. and everybody collects. when the present chairman o1 the finance committee says that we can make reforms . at this time. we all k they will  ever be done if they tire  done in connection with this piece of legislation. let me give some illustrations of who collects under this program. at the time the legislation came up. it hand a provision in response to objections to the delay that was taking place in the payment of the benefits. there was never a question that maybe these people were  entitled to benefits. so they provided in the legislation. in the human resources committee. that the federal government. which makes the payment. would  have a chance to read the xrays that came in from. the minefields. in other words. a miner would shop around and go to a doctor and stiy. "do i have black lung." the doctor might say. " you do ." so the miner would go to aher doctor. and the doctor finally would say. "yes. you have black lung." up you come with the xrays. under the then existing law. prior to 1977. the federal government had some people who would reviewv the xrays. and they found in something like 60 percent of the cases that the person did  have black lung. so they changed that. why keep somebody from collecting the benefits. so. under the 1977 bill when the xray came in from the minefield. the federal government. which was paying the bills. did  have the right to read the xray. that was outrageous. and we made valiant efforts to change it. we had a roilcall vote. as the distinguished senior senator from louisirna remembers well. we lost by a vote of something like 47 to 45. we changed it a little and said. "it you had less than 25 years in the mine fields. at least the federal government should have a chance to look at the xrays. please save a few nickles." that was finally defeated too. let me give aher illustration. you work in a coal mine. you are hit in the head by a beam and are killed. your wife is entitled to black lung payments. why is she entitled to black lung paymenits if you are hit -.v.ith a beami and killed. if you work in louisiana or rhode island and you are hit in the head by a beam. you collect workmnens compensation payments.  black lung payments. but under this law you are entitled to black lung payments. the rationale is that if you had  been hit in the head by that bearm. you would have gotten black lung. and therefore you are entitled to the benefits. i ask the distinguished manager of this legislation this question: w~hat is the program costing n ow. can the senator tell us. it is  costing $700.000. if it is  costing a couple of billion dollars. i will be surprised.
. i hope the distinguished chairman of the budget committee will accept this amendment. this is for the immunization program which has had extraordinary success over the years. and it .would just be a shame to reduce this valuable activity for the immunization of small children. if any federal program warrants our support. it is this one. the program spares children and their families from lifetimes of suffering. it also spares the federal government from spending millions upon millions of dollars on health care. we have come a long way in this area. we are close to eradicating measles. a disease which  long ago caused deaths. deafness. and other disorders. the costs of immunizing children have escalated in recent years. that necessitates this effort to make a modest increase in funding for the program. it has been estimated that last year alone costs for the measlesmumpsrubella vaccine rose by 44 percent. it is well worth buying these vaccines. however. between 1966 and 1974. we saved $1.3 billion in medical and longtermcare costs by vaccinating our children. the chairman of the pediatrics department at the duke university medical center has estimated "conservatively" that the measles program saved $10 in medical costs alone for every dollar it cost. with health care costs rising at rates well above the inflation rate over the past several years. and with the difficulty we have encountered in devising ways to control those costs. it is imperative that we take advantage of the easy. obvious. and humanitarian ways of finding savings. properly funding the immunization program does just that. i congratulate the senator from arkansas for offering this amendment. on which he and i have been associated for many years. he and i are cosponsors of it. he has presented it very well. and i certainly urge the chairman of the budget committee to accept it. i think it can be donewe do  need any rollcall votejust on a voice vote if you wish.
i am pleased to be offering an amendment to restore a modest $76.5 million to the health function for the maternal and child health care (mch) block grant. this money would be distributed evenly over the next 3 years. so that funding for the program could be raised from the present level of $347.5 million to its authorized level of $373 million. the maternal and child health block grant is an example of government at its best. the program provides desperately needed services to mothers. infants. and children. it is relatively inexpensive. and it saves money in the long run. moreover. it is a program in which federal dollars and expertise promote a commitment to.preventive health on the state level. last ylar. the program provided 1 million children with checkups. immunizations. and basic health services for hemophilia. genetic disorders. leadbased paint poisoning. and other asabling conditions. an estidlated 1 million mothers received prenatal and perinatal care under the program. in most instances the recipients of services were poor. in many instances they would have received help were it  for these programs. despite certain beliefs to the contrary. this country has a long way to go in its effort to assure that all pregnant mothers and children receive adequate care. . i am prepared to proceed with a voice vote if e of the time is being utilized.
specifically. i am troubled by proposals that would require greater outofpocket expenses for medicare and medicaid recipients. in the form of premiums or copayments. i am also troubled by the prospect of states having to reduce services as a result of a loss of funds for their medicaid programs. i would be hard pressed to suppot measures which would have such an effect.
i ask the senator. are  there many actions we can take in the finance committee with regard to medicare and medicaid which will allow us to make savings without any direct impact on beneficiaries. for instance. can we restructure our reimbursement system so that providers will be paid in a more efficient manner. so that there will be some incentives to save money in the medicare program.
i would look forward to working with the senator to find inative and sensible ways to control growth in the medicare system without hurting. beneficiaries. and to protect medicaid beneficiaries from further cuts.
. referring back to that same table on page 23 under function 550. health. the outlays provided in the conference report are increased by about $165 million above the level of the senate resolution. it is my understanding that this increase represents increased outlays as a result of entitlements. but that discretionary health programs would suffer a decrease by perhaps $100 million. i would appreciate the chairmans comment. i wish to do everything possible. as the chairman ks. to retain the levels of funding in the senate resolution for these programs that i believe to be of great impor. tance. was there a discussion in the committee of conference on how this $100 million cut will be made if. in fact. it is necessary.
. i wish to address myself to the two amendments concerning medicare which were earlier offered by my crleagues from montana and minnesota. during consideration of the budget resolution earlier this year. i expressed my concern about the effect which a reconciliation instruction for large savings in medicare and medicaid might have on beneficiaries. the budget committee originally contemplated making over $25 billion in cuts in medicare and medicald over the next 3 years. due to the efforts of senator durenberofr. myself. and others. that figure was reduced substantially. and it was hoped that when the senate met in conference with the house. the figure would be reduced even further. somewhat unexpectedly. the house approved a level of cuts which was nearly that approved by the senate. consequently. what emerged from the conference was a requirement that medicare and medicaid expenditures be reduced by nearly $14 billion over the next 3 years. i believe that the finance committee made a good faith effort to find that level of savings through a variety of measures aimed primarily at providers. etheless. the committee was still constrained to include at least three provisions which were the subject of the amendments by senators baucus and durenberger and which have a direct effect on beneficiaries. in so doing. the committee saw fit to report out a bill which would have saved approximately $1.7 billion more in medicare and medicaid than was required by the budget resolution. while i believe that it is necessary that we control federal spending in order to reduce the federal deficit and bring down interest rates. i do  feel that we should place undue burdens on beneficiariesparticularly when we are  compelled to do so. therefore. i opposed the medicare and medicaid package which was considered in the finance committee. and for this reason. i supported the efforts by my colleague from montana to eliminate provisions which would have a direct impact on the outofpocket expenses of beneficiaries. in most instances. beneficiaries already pay deductibles. copayments. medigap premiums. medicare premiums. and bills for uncovered or partially covered services. elderly people require more medical attention than others in our society and often are least able to afford it. that is why we have a medicare program. and why we should work to contain the amount of money which beneficiaries must pay out of their pockets for health care. given the failure of senator baucus amendment to carry. i was heartened that senator durenberger was able to offer a compromise amendment which reduced the burdens on medicare recipients. i am particularly pleased that the provision requiring that the part b deductible be tied to the consumer price index was struck and replaced with a less onerous provision. with respect to the home health copayment provision. and the "sunsetting" of the part b premium provision. i commend my colleague for working to limit the increase in out of pocket expenses for the elderly. in accepting this amendment. my colleagues from minnesota and kansas agree to a modification of the amendment. as suggested by the senior senator from massachusetts. though discussion on this modification was brief. it is extremely significant. my good colleagues deserve praise for their sensitivity to two issues which are easily overlooked. namely the assignment rate under medicare. and the extent to which doctors pass along to beneficiaries costs for which those providers are  reimbursed. like my colleague from massachusetts. i am concerned about the fact that doctors can and do pass along to beneficiaries fees which they are  able to collect from the federal government. a refusal to accept medicares "reasonable rate." together with the patients 20percent coinsurance as payment in full allows a doctor to seek from the beneficiary additional fees. roughly half of all medicare claims are processed on that basis. in other words. beneficiaries are liable for fees over and above the 20 percent in half of all cases. i believe that doctors in this country owe a special obligation to the poor and to the elderly. i am mindful of the fact that medicare and medicaid have  always reimbursed doctors at a level which they perceive to be fair. however. i k of case in which a doctor has been driven out of business or into poverty as a result of having to accept what medicare and medicaid d.:termine to be reasonable reimbursement levels. on the other hand. many have received a handsome living from participation in these programs. perhaps the levels of reimbursement have been lower than what doctors would ordinarily charge their patients. yet. i believe that doctors mal chat ges are. in many cases. sufficiently high so that the actual fees as paid by the government. are  grossly unjust. there is doubt about the fact that doctors have performed vital services for americans. many have given of their time and expertise with utterly selfless devotion. at the same time. doctors have. for the most part. been rewarded with generous salaries and opportunities for leading very comfortable lives. moreover. a large number of doctors received substantial federal assistance in the financing of their educations. i believe that doctors ought to remember this assista and the contribution that nearly all americans have made toward allowing them to enjoy the best that society offers as they consider their commitment to the elderly. in this light. i commend my colleague from massachusetts for his sug. gestion that we look into the possibility of mandating assignment under medicare. certainly we need to explore whether the provisions of this bill which affect doctors will have an indirect effect on the outofpocket expenses of beneficiaries. i look forward to the department of. health and human services and the finance com. mittee taking prompt action in exploring this issue. moreover. we need to look further at the ramifications of mandatory assignment. ini my state. the assignment rate has traditionally been very high. however. other states suffer from very low rates. i also look forward to examining the ways in which we can improve those rates. i hope that discussion of this issue among doctors. the elderly. researchers and policymakers will be stimulated by the actions taken on this bill. and that all parties.will reexamine the issue of responsibility for accepting the burden of paying for the health care needs of the nations elderly.e
. today i am introducing a joint resolution to protect one of the most effective federal programs available. the women. infants. and children (wic) nutrition program is a preventative health program that provides nutritional food to over 2.2 million people. in addition. wic provides nutrition education for people who desperately need it. the program is federally funded and carried out according to provisions of the child nutrition act passed by congress in 1966 and amended in 1972 and wic was the child of nutrition researchers and pediatricians who felt strongly that the combination of prenatal medical care and nutritional help would make a difference in the health of both mothers and babies. many pregnant women. infants. and young children are in danger of suffer. ing poor physical and mental health because they eat poorly and have inadequate health care. wic is designed to help such persons by directly improving what they eat and the way in which they eat. the program provides supplemental foods including milk. eggs. juice. cheese. dried beans. and peas. cereal. and infant formula. and nutrition counseling to eligible participants who have certain income limitations and show evidence of special physical need. the program provides this extra help during critical times of growth and development in order to prevent the occurrence of health problems and improve eating habits. families of lower income persons are particularly vulnerable to a poor diet. in rhode island alone. an estimated 32.000 women. infants. and children meet federal income guidelines for wic. it has been demonstrated that an adequate diet can be correlated with a higher incidence of low birth weight. a higher rate of fetal and newborn mortality. and a higher rate of developmental disabilities. for a number of years. the infant mortality rate in the united states has been a subject of some consternation. by this measure. which is frequently used to determine the level of civilization of a society. the united states has consistently ranked well below western europe and some of the other industrialized countries. the problem is concentrated among the poor and among miities. and babies of young mothers who are badly rished are in special danger. i ask unanimous consent that at this point the infant mortality rate table prepared by usdas food and nutrition service be printed into the record.
. participation in wic has decreased infant mortality rates. the incidence of low birth weight and resultant deafness. blindness. and retardation. and the incidence of anemia. for this reason. wic saves money. a harvard university school of public health study shows that each $1 spent on the prenatal component of wic saves $3 in future hospital costs for the treatment of low birth weight babies and babies with anemia. every effort must be made to insure wics continuing success. however. i fear the move to save federal dollars and to give states greater flexibility in deciding what foods should be provided through the program may. in the eyes of some. offer justification for weakening the wic program. in july. the department of agriculture suggested that the wic diet be altered to allow greater sugar content tnd less iron content. to permit flavored milk and to drop peanut butter and beans from the food list. these changes would be contrary to the programs objectives. this is a supplemental food package for lowincome. pregnant and postpartum women. and for infants and children who face malnutrition. the departments proposals conflict with the positive nutrition education practices of the program. chocolate milk is more expensive than flavored milk. the cereals that would be allowed because of their sugar content are also more expensive per serving than those with lower sugar content. these changes would in..rease the cost of the program while jeopardizing the basic nutrition of the participants. there has been significant change in the scientific literature concerning good nutrition that would warrant tampering with the present food packageparticularly for changes that would be detrimental to the beneficiaries of the wic program. remembering the ketchup and relish fiasco of last year. congress must act to insure that such proposals do  take effect. i believe that congress must send a message to the administration. and that the senate should put itself on record objecting to any changes in the wic program that are  beneficial to the women. infants. and children who participate in it. my joint resolution requires: one. that changes in wic regulations must maintain or enhance the nutritional benefits of the program. two. that the secretary of agriculture must provide proof that any proposed alterations will benefit the recipients. and three. that congress will be presented with those findings prior to regulation changes being proposed in the federal register. i urge the senate to act immediately on this joint resolution. thereby insuring the integrity of the wic program. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the record at this time.
. i am concerned with the level of appropriations for the maternal and child health block grant. under the current year. there is being spent the $373 million that was appropriated with the block grant last year and $105 million which came under thesupplement. which makes a total for the maternal and child health care of $478 million. as i understand the appropriation that is before us  in this area. it is $425 million. which is some $60 million less than what has been appropriated for the current year. so it would be my inclinationbut i should like to hear from the distinguished manager of this billto seek additional funds for the maternal and child health. to bring it up to the neighborhood of $490 million that we have appropriated in the current year. i wonder whether the distinguished manager could give me some assistance or enlightenment on this matter. i feel that this is an extremely effective program. basically. it is a preventive health program. it is trying to keep the mothers and the children of the poor healthy. before they catch any potential illnesses early. so that they can receive the services under this program. whether it is immunization or medical care. so that the disastrous illnesses or the debilitating effects that might follow can be forestalled. i k of the great interest of the manager of the bill in this area. and i would appreciate his thoughts on additional funds for this matter.
. i am pleased today to introduce legislation which provides congress with an opportunity to reexamine the current system of care provided for the severely disabled in our country. the comnmunity and family living amiendments act will gradually shift the federal share of medicaid funds from institutions to coumunitybased integrated settings. while this legislation would  propose to close institutions. it is designed to encourage states to reduce the number of persons living in institutions by providing community living. arrangements. services funded through the federal medicaid program to the severely disabled gradually would have to be provided in a community environment. under this act. services to the disabled would be more individualized. providing for the special needs of each person. those individuals needing highly structured 24hour care. including medical attention. would be provided with this care in facilities within communities. those needing fewer services. whether living at home. in foster care. in a group home. or in an apartment would also be provided with appropriate medical attention. federal medicaid dollars would be phased out from some institutions over a 10year period according to a plan developed for each institution. the plan would identify a specific amount of federal medicaid funds to be phasedout of the institution for each 6month period during the 10 years. facilities with 16 to 75 residents that opened after january 1. 1979. would have 15 years rather than 10 years before their medicaid funding would end. all medicaidfunded facilities for 15 or fewer residents that were in operation as of january 1. 1983. would  be affected by the iequirement for phasing out federal medicaid funds. the 6month phaseout target figures would be based on the unique situations facing each institution and nursing home and would take into account such factors as the size of the institutions population. the severity of its residents disabilities. and the availability of community services. following the phaseout. the federal medicaid program could only continue to fund temporary institutionalizationup to two years per personwhen such institutionalization is considered unavoidable. the federal medicaid match would be increased by 5 percent for each disabled person who is removed from an institution - and placed into a community living facility. the increment would continue for each of the first 5 years following a persons return to the community.  only will the bill provide a new way of caring for those in our society who have disabilities. it will also provide protections for those people. for instance. the proposal will require systematic and independently contracted evaluations of all care provided in all institutional and community settings. aher provision would require that a written plan be developed for all of the services required by each individual. this plan. wvhich must be revised at least once a year. would be developed with the individuals participation and with participation of his or her parents. guardians. or nextofkin. i have outlined today only a few elements of this bill. there are other important areas which the bill addresses. there will be those who will oppose this idea. at least in the outset. and i believe it is important for a very complete discussion to take place between those who support and oppose this concept of care. it is my hope that after debate. research. and discussion. my colleagues will support this bill. i hope that this process will improve it. but i am convinced that the need for an examination of the care provided to the severely disabled is desperately needed. and i strongly believe that this bill is an appropriate starting place. by mr. symms:
. in my own state of rhode islandwhich. i believe. operates one of the best programs in the nationthe effects of lower funding would be devastating. and rhode islands case is representative of the nations. in rhode island alone. several thousand fewer women would receive pre- and perinatal care. thousands of children would  receive well care or home health care or be able to participate in a leadpoisoning program. do we want to go back to the days when hundreds of thousands of children suffered brain damage because they ingested leadbased paint and were  adequately screened or treated. i do  believe that we do. especially when such horrid effects can be prevented. if the costs in human terms are  convincing egh evidence that maternal and child health warrants our help. then the dollars and cents figure will make the point. in 1977. gao reported that the cost of genetic screening at birth. along with early treatment of seven common disorders. was less than oneeighth the cost of caring for an impaired child over a lifetime. in texas. a recent study showed that each $1 spent on preventive care for children resulted in an $8 savings in longterm costs. basic vaccinationswhich as many as 40 percent of your american children still do  receiveare emously cost effective. the center for disease control has estimated that the $180 million we spent on the measles vaccination. program between 1966 and 1974 saved $1.3 billion in medical and longterm care costs. this says hing of the reduction in instances of deafness. retardation. and other crippling effects that has occurred. maternal and child health dollars are  only dollars well spent. but they are dollars which we can afford  to spend. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
ial commission on drunk driving. the lautenbergdanforth amendment recognizes the need for this combined approach by establishing a program of modest rewards for states which adopt mandatory license suspension as a penalty for drunk driving. narrowing the discretion of judges in setting penalties for drunk driving is extremely important in deterring violators. in addition. computerized safety recordkeeping systems are an effective intrastate enforcement tool which this amendment would encourage through incentive grants. this proposal also includes an incentive for the states to establish programs to combat the problem of drugged driving. the administration has expressed its strong support for the lautenbergdanforth proposal. and similar legislation has been approved in the house. passage of this amendment will thus provide the best opportunity for positive congressional action this year in the fight against drunk driving. i believe we must continue to examine carefully the comprehensive measures recommended in the cotnmission report. and to closely monitor the progress of the states in responding to these suggestions. congress should be prepared to approve stronger incentives to encourage mandatory license suspensions and other deterrents in the future. alcohol abuse and its potential for resulting in tragedy on our highways will  disappear. our efforts to grapple with the problem must  end with the conclusion of this debate. i look forward to joining my colleagues in a continuing effort to reduce death on our nations highways due to drunk driving.e
. i am pleased to offer legislation today that would require businesses to include childrens preventive care and health supervision services in their employee health plans. such services would be required for the insurance premiums to he deductible as a business expense. few americans woulil disagree with the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." yet our present system of health care clearly contradicts this proposition. employ:r group health insurance has become the dominant method of financing personal health care services in this country. over 90 percent of all employment groups  have some form of private health insurance. but what is the focus of this insurance. the focus is on acute care needsa sickness insurance system w hose costs are out of control. rather than a true heulth insurance system that would avoid unnecessary illnesses. here is this focus less appropriate than when it is applied to children. unfortunately. group health insurance plans have been given ilcentive to cover and to encourage the services children need. we need to redesign the system to encourage vaccines. $7.40 was saved. young families with children generally have limited incomes and must rely heavily on their employerprovided health insurance. if he plan excludes coverage of preventive health care. such as immuniznations. for children. many families will wait for sertous symptoms to appear before payilg outofpocket for care. the average monthly cost per family for this additional coverage would be $2.28. coverage would extend only to a schedule of accepted and recommended examinations and immunizations. tile cost for all recommended services from birth through the age of 20 is approximately equal to the cost of 1 day in the hospital. the pediatric health care incentive tax act is designed to reverse tile costly insurance emphasis on hospitalisation and aicknessonly coverage. and to create costeffective incentives for prevention and health maintenance. support for this measure will come from all groups in our society who feel as i do: that our children are our most important and precious asset and that their health must be protected.e by mr. symms (for himself. mr. dixon. mr. mcclure. mr. borst and mr. helms)
yes. senator. i do. it would  be proper to require that impoundment to be closed out permanently prematurely if it can handle wastes that are  hazardous wastes while being protective of human health and the environment. s mr. randolph. i thank the senator.e
 of family health international. approximately "the cost of a small order of mcdonalds french fries per person per year" on all aspects of reproductive research. as recently as 30 years ago. research was being done on contraception. it was  until 1968 that the center for population research within the national institutes of health was created. in 1983 funding for the center was $86 million. in 1972 it was $85 million. only $8.6 million of this actually goes toward contraceptive development. the remainder toward basic research in reproductive sciences. the $8.6 million is a particularly insignificant sum when one considers that. according to mr. potts. it can "cost up to $50 million and take more than 10 years of research" to bring a new contraceptive to the market. in the past. industry was largely responsible for the research and development of many of the currently available contraceptives. however. industry is  far less excited about expending the effort to conduct new research and development because the cost and time involved from initial development to approval of marketing by the food and drug administrationfdais a deterrent. pharmaceutical companies would rather concentrate on developing drugs to treat disease than drugs and devices to prevent pregnancies given the cost and the time. recently. the ford foundation and the canadian international development research council. which made major contributions to contraceptive research. have withdrawn their support in light of the dwindling concern about the relative importance of problems of population growth. there seems to be far more concern about abortion than about prevention of unwanted pregnancies. its ironic that the abortion controversy works against contraceptive research instead of in its favor. the future of contraceptive research is  bright. despite the need to make it a priority. that is why i am today introducing legislation which requires the national institutes of health to conduct research on. and develop better means of contraception. requiring the national institute of healths institute of child health and human developmentwhich includes the center for population researchto use at least 10 percent of its budget for new research and development would spur the search for safe and effective means of birth control. the office of techogy assessment recommends that $20 million more a year be spent on contraceptive research. and the 10percent minimum provided in this bill would implement this recommendation. every child has a right to be wanted. women and men need safe and effective methods of birth control. a large number of the millions of unwanted pregnancies and resulting abortions that occur each year can be prevented. i invite my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
yes. if the administrator of the environmental protec. tion agency determines. after ice and an opportunity for hearing in the affected areas. that placement of the waste would be protective of human health and environment. and if the administrator establishes performance and permitting standards for such facilities. then the agency can issue a disposal permit.
. i am pleased to offer legislation today that will require businesses to include chils drens preventive care and health sui pervision services in their employee health benefit packages. such services would be required for the insurance e premiums to be deductible as a business expense. employer group health insurance plans are the major method of financing health care in the united states. over 9a percent of all employment groups  have some form of private health insurance. few americans would disagree with the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." yet our present system of health care contradicts this proposition. unfortunately. most coverage provided by health insurance plans is aimed at acute care.  preventive care. the result is an acute care system. in which costs are out of control. rather than a true health insurance system that would avoid unnecessary illnesses. here is this focus less appropriate than when it is applied to children. unfortunately. group health insurance plans have been given incentive to cover the services children need most. the legislation i am introducing today. the child health incentives reform plan [chirp]. focuses on children for a simple reason. more than any other age group in the population. children require regular preventive care and screening to detect and prevent disease and disorders. preventive care  only improves their overall health but it is also cost effective. more than one study has shown that immunizations save money in the long run. results indicate that for every dollar spent on measles vaccinations. $10 was saved and for every dollar spent on mumps vaccinations. $7.40 was saved. other studies have demonstrated that eligible medicaid children provided with early and periodic screening. diagis. and treatment [epsdti had 30 to 50 percent lower hospital and medical costs than other medicaid children. opponents to health insurance coverage for preventive services for chil* dren argue that regular health screenings are a budgetable expense. however. young families with children generally have limited incomes and must rely heavily on their employerprovided health insurance. if the plan does  cover preventive health care. such as immunizations. many families will wait for serious symptoms to appear before paying for care. the sad truth is that 24 percert of all preschoolage children are  immunized. besides the tragic diminution in the quality of life for a child left retarded by measles. the cost of lifetime institutional care can be staggering. the childrens defense tmd estimates the cost at between $500.000 and $1.000.000. the average monthly cost per family for the additional coverage outlined in the bill would be at the most $2.28. or about 1 percent of the employers current payment. the cost for all recommended services from birth through the age of 20 is approximately equal to the cost of i day in the hospital. i believe that this is an important step to take and support for this measure will come from all groups in our society who feel as i do: that our children are our most important and precious asset and that their health must be protected.e by mr. deconcini (for himself. mr. kennedy. mr. pell.
. i am just assuming that the amendment that we are discussing is the one that the senator will present. and that it is in the form that the senator has described and answered questions about. first of all. let me ask one thing about this amendment. i k that we are upset about the midwestern farmers. that is where the problem is. does this amendment go beyond that. does it cover tobacco and peanuts. for example.
. the amendment before us is the result of a great deal of discussion by those of us who were concerned about the original cuts in medicare and medicaid proposed in the white housesenate agreement. this amendment eliminates all references to a cap on the medicaid program and reduces the savings mark for the finance committee in this program to $1.2 billion over 3 years. i believe we can reach this mark with changes which will  adversely affect those who need the program the most. the amendment also reduces the increase in the premium for part b from 35 percent to 30 percent over 5 years and eliminates the home health copayment requirement. overall. the amendment reduces the savings mark for the finance committee to meet through savings in the medicare and medicaid programs from approximately $20 billion to $17.5 billion. a mark i believe the committee can meet without great difficulty. throughout this process. i have been very concerned about the impact of the spending reduction marks. initially. they were simply too large to achieve without having an extremely adverse affect on the elderly. disabled and poor. i was especially concerned about the proposed cap on the medicaid program. under the cap each state would have received only what it is currently getting from the federal side of the equation adjusted for medical services inflation. the federal match for all practical purposes would be eliminated and the program would be changed from an entitlement to a block grant. a cap means that states would  be able to increase eligibility or services. one of the populations which would have been severely affected by the cap proposal is the elderely. longterm care services for the elderly alone account for almost onehalf of the cost of the medicaid program. medicaid assumed this role by defaultmany. elderly individuals who are in nursing homes entered as private pay payors. once their savings become depletedthey had gone through all of their savings and assetsthey ended up on medicaid. half of all nursing home residents are the newly impoverished. as my hearings on longevity clearly indicated. the projected increases in the elderly population. . especially those over 85. are astounding. this means that the number of elderly indi.viduals who require longterm care will be rapidly growing. if a medicaid cap were a part of this package. it would mean that states would have difficulty in providing care to this growing population. aher affected population is the developmentally disabled. more of these individuals would end up in institutions under a cap because the states would  be able to pay for expanded community based services. a medicaid cap would place emous pressures on the states to limit their benefits package to emergency services and basic hospital. nursing home and physician care. the development of community based alternatives and preventive health care services would be harmed. in short. a cap would  take into account changing demographic patterns and needs among the various states. such as increases in the elderly population at risk of nursing home placement or increases in the number of unemployed or working poor families. overall. i am pleased with this amendment. it is a workable and satisfactory compromiseone which i hope all of my colleagues will support.
 of family health international. we spend approximately "the cost of a small order of mcdonalds french fries per person per year" on all aspects of reproductive research. i believe this is grossly inadequate. as recently as 30 years ago. there was research on contraception. it was  until 1968 that the center for population research was created within the national institutes of health. in 1972 funding for the center was $85 million: in 1983 it was $86 million. only $8.6 million of these funds are actually used in contraceptive development. the remaining funds are spent on basic research in reproductive sciences. this amount is particularly inadequate when one considers that. according to mr. potts. it can. cost up to $50 million and take more than 10 years of research to bring a new contraceptive to the market. in the past. the pharmaceutical industry was largely responsible for the research and development of many currently available contraceptives. unfortunately. many of these companies do  find this type of product to be worth the time and money involved in obtaining approval by the fda. pharmaceutical companies would rather concentrate on developing drugs to treat disease than drugs and devices to prevent pregnancies given the cost and time. the future of contraceptive research is  bright. despite the need to make it a priority. that is why i am introducing this legislation today. every child has a right to be wanted. women and men need safe and effective methods of birth control. a large number of the millions of unwanted pregnancies that occur each year can be prevented with new and improved methods of contraception. by mr. helms (for himself. mr. east. and mr. denton):
. today. with senator rudman. i am introducing legislation that seeks to improve the lives of children worldwide. this legislation will earmark.  appropriate. $30 million in the agriculture. rural development and nutrition account of the fiscal year 1986 budget of the agency for international development [aid]. disbursed over 3 years. this money will fund nutrition programs which reduce vitamin a deficiency. an estimated 500.000 children in developing countries go blind each year because they do  get egh vitamin a. ten million . children suffer from this nutritional disorder annually. it occurs in bangladesh. india. indonesia. the philippines. haiti. latin america. and africa. the world health organization considers vitamin a deficiency a public health problem in 73 countries and territories. approximately 35 million of the worlds 42.2 million blind live in developing nations. that number is expected to double by the end of the century. blindness can be easily prevented but programs to prevent have lacked support. blindness resulting from vitamin a deficiency occurs when the lack of vitamin a is quite severe. before blindness occurs. damage to the intestinal tract and respiratory system causes illness and death from increased susceptibility to such diseases as measles. gastrointestinal problems. and pneumonia. therefore. vitamin a is crucially important to maintaining overall health for children in less developed countries. the need to prevent vitamin deficiency has never been greater. in africa. in particular. up to 10 percent of the childrep in the feeding camps of ethiopia and the sudan are becoming irreversibly blind through vitamin a deficiencies. johns hopkins university conducted a study in 420 indonesian villages with funds from aid. 30.000 randomly selected children given vitamin a had death rates onethird lower than those who did  receive the supplement. golden bullets is what international relief workers call a large dose vitamin a capsule. this capsule is the size of a pea. does  need refrigeration and need only be administered once every 6 months. one vitamin a capsule costs only 2 to 4 cents each and is heralded by the helen keller institute as the solution that will head off the devastating damage that children suffer from vitamin a deficiency. helen keller international and the international eye foundation are the two leading organizations involved. in vitamin a programs. both agencies strongly support this legislation. and believe that $30 million could be efficiently allocated for the implementation of vitamin a activities. following is a chart summarizing proposals for expanded activities which was developed in consultation with aid. the world health organization [who). and helen keller international.
. i. am pleased to join my colleagues from minnesota and pennsylvania in introducing the fair medicare appeals act of 1985. under current law there is a difference between the manner in which disputes concerning the amount of benefits under part a and part b of medicare are resolved. there is a twotrack system for the appeal of carrier decisions. under part a if a beneficiary has a dispute with a provider. he or she may appeal the decision by the carrier to an administrative law judge. if the dispute involves more than $1.000 the beneficiary may appeal the administrative law judges decision through full judicial review. on the other hand. if there is a dispute under part b of the program. the beneficiary is entitled only to receive a hearing with a hearing officer who is  a lawyer. is employed by the carrier. and works out of a manualwith consideration of case law or even previous decisions made by the carrier. the carriers decision is final. there is appeal. this legislation would make four major changes in the part b appeals process. disputes involving amounts between $100 and $500 will continue to be settled by the carrier. disputes involving amounts between $500 and $1.000 will have recourse to a full hearing by an administrative law judge. if the amount in dispute is greater than $1.000. a beneficiary may appeal the administrative law judges decision through full judicial review. finally. all beneficiaries will have the right to choose representation by their providers in any appeals procedures under part a and part b. the difference beween these two appeal procedures was  a problem when the part b program was small. however. today with the increased complexity and increased number of claims the difference is difficult to justify. the current part b appeals process was designed 20 years ago. it has been 13 years since congress last took a serious look at medicare appeals procedures and procedural protections. i believe it is time to reexamine the system and make muchneeded reforms. part b of medicare has become an integral part of health care for the elderly. congresi has added services under the program to address the changing needs of the elderly. with the advent of prospective payment system under part a of medicare. beneficiaries rely heavily on the services offered under part b. that system has created pressures on hospitals to discharge patients sooner than in the past and consequently beneficiaries need the services of posthospital providers. which are paid for through part b of the program. like physician and home health care services. in addition to these demands. advances in medical techogy have made possible the performance of many surgical procedures on an outpatient basis. techogical advances have also created increased availability and demand for beneficiaries to receive medical care in their homes rather than in hospitals or other institutional settings. in short. the medicare program has changed dramatically in both structure and nature since its beginnings 20 years ago. yet beneficiary and provider protections have  kept up with these changes. as congress continues to reform and restructure the medicare program. our goals must be high quality of care. fair administration of benefits. appropriate payment of benefits. and a speedy and fair resolution of disputes. the fair medicare appeals act of 1985 will further these goals.e by mr. heinz:
. i would like to bring to the attention of the senate the following september 5. 1985. new york times article about the perils of vitamin a deficiency among the children in developing countries. this article clearly points out the need for the legislation senator rudman and i have introduced. our legislation. s. 1451. would earmark $30 million in the agriculture. rural development. and nutrition account of the aid budget to be disbursed over a 3year period. for nutrition programs which reduce vitamin a deficiency. we believe the cost to be minimal in terms of the benefit it provides to children worldwide. i call on my colleagues to read the following article and add their names as cosponsors to this important legislation. i ask that the article be printed in the record at this point.
. one of the people most overlooked in this event was joes mother. barbara cons. soon after joes birth. barbara cons lost her husband. she has six children. joe is the youngest. she raised her children on her own. being a parent is  easy in the best of circumstances. but when you have a child with special needs. it takes even more energy. patience and love. barbara cons believes in joes abilities and potential. that belief has been the most essential part of joes development. some people would say that joe is an exceptional case. that other people with his disability could  do the same. i would suggest. however. that if joe is extraordinary. it was because his family never gave up on him. because he had the advantage of living at home.  in an institution. because he had the advantage of being born late egh that he had the chance to attend school with handicapped children. because he had the support friendship and encouragement from older brothers and sisters at home. joe is an example of how lives can be changed with the simple passage of important legislationin his case the passage of the education for all handicapped children act of 1973. the next step is to ensure that medicaid funds are available and widely used in institutional settingsa situation that does  exist today. i hope that all of my colleagues in congress will remember joe and his experiences here as we consider legislation that affects disabled individuals. there are people like joe all over this country. in all of our communities. they deserve a chance that we are  giving them todaya chance to grow. to flourish and to become part of society. each of us should have the opportunity to work and live our lives with dignity. we should be challenged and given the chance to feel good about our achievements. joe and the hundreds of thousands of individuals like him in our country today have a contribution to make to society. i hope that everyone who has been touched by joethrough meeting him or seeing him on televisidnwill think seriously about giving them that chance. which is through legislation that we have spohsored here to provide that medicaid funds can be used for those who are living in the community rather than solely in institutions.
. today i am pleased to join senator andrews in cosponsoring s. 1446. this bill will improve and extend veterans health benefits for those men who were taken as prisoners of war while serving our nation. this past september. i had the pleasure of hosting the rhode island veterans forum. which i created to advise me on issues of concern to the veterans community. among the issues raised was the need to expand the scope of illnesses. for which pows may be treated under the veterans health care program. this bill does exactly that. american veterans deserve the finest and most comprehensive medical care available. and with this bill. their coverage will be extended to include care for injuries associated with the pains and illnesses that pows often suffer as a result of extended incarceration at enemy hands. this legislation helps compensate our former pows for the sacrifices they have made while defending democratic institutions abroad. i urge all of my colleagues in the senate to join senator andrews and myself in helping american pows by supporting this bill.
. i would like to discuss briefly s. 873. the community and family living amendments of 1985. which i introduced in april of this year. i believe that reform of the medicaid system as it applies to the developmentally. disabled is long overdue. consequently. i introduced the community and family living amendments. s. 873. in april of this year. this legislation is a revised and refined version of s. 2053 which i introduced in 1983. a policy change at the federal level is long overdue. federal medicaid funds flow primarily toward large facilities. since 1977. less than 20 percent of the dollars for intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded have gone to support persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities in the community. while there is a great deal of interest in supporting people in the community and removing the emphasis on institutional care. there is much variation in the rate at which states approach the task. since 1977. more than onehalf of the residents of large facilities in vermont. michigan. ohio. and nebraska have returned to the community. in other states. this figure is less than 10 percent. three stateslouisiana. tennessee. and mississippihave actually increased the number of persons living in institutions in the last 7 years. my legislation is an attempt to encourage all states to move in the direction of allowing individuals with developmental disabilities to live in the community. either at home. on their own or in a group home. my bill makes this possible by providing resources to the states to offer a better level of care than that available in most larger facilities. the past year has proven that any proposal to phase down medicaid support for institutions and increase such support for community based services is a highly charged issue. clearly the idea evokes tremendous emotion and controversy. most of the debates about the bill tend to revolve solely around whether institutions are good or bad. i believe those debates are a waste of time. the real issue is whether we can improve our current system of care. i believe that s. 873 contains the necessary elements of such a reform. id like to spend a few moments talking about the provisions of my legislationmany of which are iged in the heat of these debates. some critics say that my proposal will allow only one kind of service. everyone must be in a 12- or 15bed group home. hing could be further from the truth. my bill will allow medicaid expenditures to support people in a wide variety of settings: their family home. foster homes. adoptive homes. special living arrangements for 2 or 3 or more people with special needs. new community residences up to about 12 people. existing residences up to 15. and existing clusters of up to three homes. in addition. s. 873 would allow approximately 15 percent of a states total medicaid budget to be used to support facilities which are larger than those i have just outlined. thus i offer. for the first time. a continuum of services. what more could we ask for. some critics of my bill argue that it proposes dumping people from institutions into the streets without needed services. however. under my bill. there are services which states must provide to each person who is deinstitutionalized: respite care. personal attendant care as appropriate. case management. and protection and advocacy services. my bill says that each person must have an individual written plan of habilitation. that the plan must be developed by an interdisciplinary team. and that family members. guardians. or. in some cases. the disabled person himself. can participate on that team. my bill further stipulates that any one who is to be moved out of an institution must be given 60 days written ice. opportunity for a due process appeal. and that the services specified in the written plan must be in place before the individual is moved. for the most part what we have seen in the past in the name of deinstitutionalization is really dumping. my bill is an antidumping bill. my bill stands for the proposition that we are moving people back to the communitywe are  moving protoplasm or objects. we are moving people into homes where they can live safely. with the security and support they need along with the opportunity to grow and develop as individuals. my bill says that community residences need to be certified. licensed. or accredited. that staff need to be retrained to work in the community. my bill requires states to develop a plan of action for the next 15 yearsa plan which must be approved by the secretary of health and human services. my bill contains a private right of action clause: if an individual is  being properly served because the state is failing to live up to its agreement in the state plan. the individual may sue. when people state that they oppose my bill. one must ask what provisions of the bill they oppose. are they opposed to independent case management services. are they opposed to written program plans. or 60day ice of moves. are they opposed to respite services or protection and advocacy services. are they opposed to helping families stay together by supporting families who wish to keep their children at home. i hope that my colleagues can see that this is  just a mindless dumping bill. i hope that they can see that we can make deinstitutionalization a reality. given the proper support required by my bill. i hope they can see that by the year 2000. we can live with many fewer institutional placements than we have today. i ask all of my colleagues in the senate to join me in developing a system where each person. matter how disabled. is cared for. supported and served in his or her own communitywhere we all belongtogether.
. in summation. is this: as has been pointed out earlier. a lot has been said on this amendment. i do want to thank those who have spoken in favor .of it. it seems to me we are making two points here. first. we need the revenue. when we are running these horrendous dificits every year. every additional cent. every dollar. every million or billion dollars we can achieve is good for the nation. second. this is a health measure. a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote to improve the health of our nation. there is a direct . correlation between the size of the tax and the amount of smoking. and particularly in connection with young people. the young people are in the group that do  have egh financial elasticity so they can continue to buy cigarettes at the increased price. as has been pointed out. when we went from 8 to 16 cents. there was a fairly dramatic decrease in the number of young people who were smoking. who took up smoking or continued smoking. this is  as great an increase as nearly. passed in the finance commit-. tee. there by a vote of 10 to 8 an increase of 32 cents a pack was defeated. this is a total of 24 cents. i think anybody who has ever had a relative. a friend. or an acquaintance or has seen anybody who suffers from emphysema. which to me is one of the most frightening ailments i have seen. or who has* seen loved ones suffering from cancer of the lungs. cancer of the chest. the heart ailments that are associated with smoking. will realize that we ought to step up and support this amendment. it is  going to solve the problem completely but it will help. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
i share that view. i remember the days when we could  have margarine across the country because i guess the senators from wisconsin. among others. were successful in preventing yellow colored margarine to be sold as margarine. remember. you would have to buy it and you would have a little packet and you would mix it up together. this was to protect the cows in wisconsin. to me that seemed ridiculous. but the chips fell where they fell. indeed. it was subsequently done and i think the cows in wisconsin have done quite well. yes. i think we ought to be getting toward a regime where there are limitations. if milk can be shipped from minnesota to wisconsin. to california. to rhode island or some other place. and the water taken out and then shipped as dried milk. with water addedand i can only assume that there are sufficient health safeguards and. as the senator from minnesota has said. proper labeling and all thatit seems like an idea we ought to investigate. without king all the details of it. to me it strikes me as having merit. but that is  the point. the reason we are here this aftern-
. i would like to thank senator kasten and the staff of the appropriations committee for incorporating my vitamin a legislation into s. 1816. the foreign assistance appropriations bill which has been included in the continuing resolution. the committee has -included language earmarking $8 million in the agriculture. rural development- and nutrition account of the agency for international development [aid]. for the vitamin a deficiency programs. an estimated 500.000 children go blind in developing countries each year because they do  get egh vitamin a. approximately 35 million of the worlds 42.2 million blind live in developing nations. that number is expected to double by the end of the century. blindness can easily be prevented but programs for its prevention have lacked support. before blindness occurs. however. damage to the intestinal tract and respiratory system cause many other illnesses and even death. ten million children suffer from this nutritional disorder annually. the world health organization considers vitamin a deficiency a public health problem in 73 countries and territories. these funds will be used to set up programs worldwide to distribute megadoses of vitamin a and to teach people how to grow foods rich in vitamin a and to prepare those foods properly to ensure nutrient loss. these programs will be administered by aid. the world health organization and the international vitamin a consultative groupkn . as ivacg.
. the reconciliation package before us represents a great deal of hard work and careful discussion. it also contains an extraordinary number of provisions which might be called extraneous by some. but which are extremely important. medicaid for several years . i have been working to reform the medicaid system. specifically. i have been working - to change the program so that medicaid funds can be used for communitybased longterm care services to our citizens with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. in the long run. i believe this system is in need of a major overhaul. the current system is biased toward the use of institutional facilitiesbut we should be working harder to keep handicapped citizens in the community. true medicaid reform. such as what i have proposed in my legislation. s. 873the community and family living amendments of 1985may take years to accomplish. in the meantime. .there are several interim changes that should be made. we were able to include some of these changes during this reconciliation process.
. the pending amendment would have addressed a problem that is an unintended result of the enactment of the medicare prospective payment system. to leave the formula for the medicare part a deductible in its current form truly would be unfair. the prospective payment system established a single rate of payment for hospital based upon the illness to be treatedthe drg rate. this new payment system has created an incentive for hospitals to ecoize. which. in turn. has resulted in shorter hospital stays for medicare beneficiaries. one problem which has developed as a result of these incentives is in the calculation of the part a deductible which the sponsors of this amendment seek to address. currently. the part a deductible is based on the national average cost pay in the hospital. however. because we  pay a flat rate per hospital stay and hospital stays on the average are shorter. the average cost per day for medicare beneficiaries has increased at a tremendous rate due to fixed hospital costs which  must be allocated over a shorter period of time. at the same time health care costs are increasing at only about 10 percent. the part a deductible will increase at about 43 percent over 2 years. last year alone. the part a deductible for medicare increased by an unprecedented 23 percentfrom $400 to $492. the projected increase for 1987 is aher $80which would bring the first day deductible t o $572. the adoption of this amendment would reduce the increase in the part a deductible. while i agree with the intent of the sponsors of this amendment. i was extremely concerned about the prospect of this amendment being offered in the context of the budget resolution for two reasons. first. this is an issue which we can adequately address in the finance committee this year during the reconciliation process. as a member of that committee i intend to work to ensure that we do effectively address the problem. second. i believe that the domenicichiles budget proposal is the most fair and responsible proposal to be considered by congress in the past few years and i was concerned that if this amendment were adopted. then the budget proposal will unravel. i k thatmany of the organizations representing the elderly felt the same way. this is a complicated problem. and one which should be dealt with cautiously and carefully in the finance committeethe committee with jurisdiction. whatever solutions we may adopt will affect the health of the hospital insurance trust fund which may have solvency problems by the mid1990s. i am extremely pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement on this issue. i intend to work closely with my colleagues on the finance committee to ensure that we resolve this troubling problem over the next few months during the reconciliation process.
. the principal thrust of this legislation is to make sure that every disabled individual has the opportunity to reach his or her fullest potential. we believe that this is  true currently in the institutional settings that so many people are forced into because that is the only setting for which medicaid will pay.
. people with disabilities have the right and the need to live in the community. regardless of the severity of their disability. we have the technical skill and the professional expertise to make this right a reality. this is an approach proven in community after community throughout this countryin my own state of rhode island. in michigan. in new hampshire. in utah. and in many other states. i have introduced legislationthe community and family living amendments of 1985. s. 873which would encourage states to develop communitybased services for those with mental or physical impairments. this would be accomplished by phasing down federal medicaid support for large institutions and transferring that support to the community. s. 873. the legislation i am introducing. proposes a complete restructuring of the medicaid program as it relates to those with severe disabilities. the enactment of s. 873 would mean that individuals  living in the community will never have to face the traumatic experience of being placed in an institution simply because there is other place to go. it would mean that families would never be faced with a situation in which they can longer care for their children at home and the only other option is institutionalization. in order for a disabled individual to move back or remain in the community much careful planning is needed. in other words. the transfer from an institution to a communitybased living facility requires planning. under the plan that i have proposed. every institutionalized person with a physical or mental impairment would have a right to have an individually tailored program that best meets their needs for supervision. support. health services. and education. my bill requires written program plans. developed at team meetings. with parent participation. i have stressed the word "program" for a reason. it seems to me we need to stop equating buildings with programs. our society can and must offer a continuum of services. but we do  need large buildings to accomplish this. the ion that big buildings equal better programs has been shown to be false. some states are  yet ready to support some of their most challenging citizens in community settings. that is why the bill i have introduced provides a length of time. a period of 15 years in all. for this transition. . 15 years is a long time. it goes to the end of this century. and. by the end of that time. we certainly ought to be able to have worked out a transfer of most people out of institutions into small communitybased facilities. however. in the legislation. i have provided that 15 percent of the medicaid funds currently going to the states can be used for institutionalization. my -bill gives parents the right to review and appeal any program dealing with their children. if a child is to be moved out before the parent thinks it is rightthat is. moved out of the institutionthen the parent has the right of appeal. my legislation stands for many of the ideals held dear by all of us. those ideals should apply to all americans. but today they do . severely disabled people have been secondclass citizens for too long. locked up in institutions. what we are trying to do is get them out of institutions. this has proven tremendously successful in my state and in other states. as well. when the person is out of the institution in a smaller setting. communitybased setting. that person realizes his or her full potential and learns to do things he or she was never called upon to do in a large institution. so i ask my colleagues to join me and eight other cosponsors of s. 873 in developing a system where each person. matter how disabled. is cared for. supported. and served in the community where we all belongtogether.
. infant mortality and low birthweight among babies are two of the most distressing problems facing our nation. today. i am pleased to join senator bentsen in sponsoring legislation to address these problems. eleven babies die out of every 1.000 infants born in this country. few events could be as tragic as the death of a baby or the birth of a baby with birth defects. many such heartbreaking outcomes could be prevented with proper prenatal care. the future of our nation depends on our children and they deserve a better chance to be born healthy. it has been estimated that half the birth defects which occur in this country could be prevented through proper prenatal care. prenatal services can drastically reduce the frequency of lowbirthweight babies who are 40 times more likely than other infants to die within the first year and who tend to suffer a wide range of longterm health problems. the legislation we are introducing today will improve the delivery of prenatal care and health services to lowincome women and their children. our bill will permit the states to furnish prenatal. delivery. and postpartum care through the medicaid program to lowincome pregnant women and medical assistance to their children under 6 years of age. think of the incalculable human cost which can be avoided if we improve the delivery of prenatal services. in purely ecoic terms. an average investment of $600 for routine prenatal services and counseling could save as much as $120.000 to $200.000 for extended neonatal intensive care and an average of $40.000 per year for 50 years for a disabled person in an institution. the united states has one of the worlds best programs for the treatment of lowbirthweight babies. yet. we have a poor prevention program and our rate of lowbirthweight babies is higher than 11 other countries. according to the national academy of sciences. the rate could be cut by better than a tenth through improved prenatal care. the academy estimates a costbenefit ration of $3.38 saved in the first year of a childs life for $1 spent in prenatal care. under current law. states that want to provide essential health care under medicaid to poor women and infants. only provide services to those who are eligible for cash welfare. therefore. health care services offered through the medicaid program reach fewer than onehalf of all infants living in poverty. the legislation we are introducing today will begin to close this gap. it extends to states the option of providing prenatal. delivery. and post partum care to lowincome pregnant women. in addition. medical assistance can be provided for lowincome infants and children under 6 years of age in families living at the poverty level without requiring that they also meet the eligibility standards for aid to families with dependent children. when infant mortality trends deteriorate as they have in the united states. we must step back and askare our health delivery services adequate and effective. when the united states has poorer pregnancy outcomes than 11 other developed countries. we must ask why. when low birth weight is excessive among the poor. the poorly educated and those that do  receive proper prenatal care. we must take action. our bill is necessary in order to insure that the poor who do  currently receive proper health care services have access to them. it is estimated that this bill will allow states to furnish services to an additional 40.000 lowincome women who currently receive services or at best limited services. even during a time of fiscal restraint it is sound ecoic policy to invest in the health of our poor mothers and children. investment in improved pregnancy outcomes has emous future returns in both human and fiscal terms..
. medicare is the federal program which provides states with the bulk of funding for longterm care services for those who are disabled. currently medicare funds flow primarily toward large facilities such as the ladd school in our state. the reason for this has more to do with what medicaid will pay for than what is the best system of care and services for the individual. the bill that i have introduced. s. 873. stands for the proposition that there ought to be a range of services available for those with mental and physical impairments. it recognizes that the number of disabled individuals who require institutionaltype care is far smaller than the number of those who would benefit from the communitybased services. in other words. if we look at it carefully. we will find that most individuals in institutions can thrive and expand and reach their fullest potential in a smaller setting. in a group home of. say. 5. 10. or perhaps as many as 15 individuals. this bill stands. as i say. for a broad range of services. yes. in this legislation we have provided that 15 percent of the money can go for those who are to be in institutions. i personally think everybody can do better in a community setting. but there is disagreement on this. so in our legislation. following hearingswe have had hearings in chicago. we have had hearings in minneapolis and st. paul. we have had hearings in my state of rhode island and. of course. the hearings here in washingtonit turns out that there is a considerable body of opinion out there that says some individuals can go out into the community. by "going out into the community." i have to make clear what i am talking about. these people are  thrown out in the streets as is sometimes suggested. by "in the community." i mean they are carefully supervised. there is within the group setting those with kledge and experience to monitor the situation. to make sure that those individuals always have the proper
i share senator moynihans deep concern about the deletion of funds for the work incentive program from the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriation bill. it is my hope that the conferees will consider restoring funds to this very important program. the win program is essential to istates efforts to promote selfsufficiency and reduce welfare dependence among .afdc recipients. in rhode island there are approximately 16.000 afdc recipients. 90 percent of whom are women and single parents. and the age of this population is growing younger each year. under fiscal year 1986 funding. the win program in rhode island provided day care assistance. education. job training. and job search services to 2.000 of the eligible afdc population. it would be a mistake to weaken our commitment to assist these young families in their .quest for independence. it is my hope that senate conferees will work to restore funding for the win program when the conference takes place for the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriation bill.

. i have an amendment which i will withhold from offering for the moment. i am confident that we can address my concerns without amending the language of the bill. first. i want to commend my colleagues. the distinguished senators from utah and vermont. for adding $1.300.000 to the fiscal year 1987 appropriation for the environmental protection agency to restore the radon research program. and for adding $1.200.000 to the amount requested for radon activities. i understand that these two additions will increase radon activities by almost 50. percent. the problem of the seepage of radon gas into buildings and homes in emerging as a major environmental problem and could be a leading cause of lung cancer among smokers. a recent gao report concludes that indoor radon contamination is a national problem. already homeowners are beginning to employ contractors to mitigate high radon levels found in their homes. the publication of a technical guidance manual on effective mitigation techniques. provided for in your bill. is essential to assure that money being invested by these homeowners is wisely spent. and is in fact ridding homes of unacceptably high levels of radon. there is a legitimate concern that epas emphasis on exposure surveys to identify radon concentrations in homes may outrun our technical capabilities to correct such problems. unless epa assigns research on radon mitigation techniques a much higher priority. homeowners will inevitably waste money and be victimized by incompetent or unscrupulous contractors. the additional funds you provide will help develop and validate cost effective radon mitigation methods for various types of residential construction. . this brings me to the subject of my concern and my proposal. if i may engage the floor managers of the bill in a short colloquy. it is my understanding that the national radon survey being conducted by epa is aimed exclusively at residences. i would ask the distinguished floor managers if they have also considered the need to determine whether elevated radon levels exist in our schools. kledgeable experts at epa have informed my staff that of all public buildings. schools may be the most likely to suffer from high radon levels because many schools are one story. close to the ground structures. although there are studies of children exposed to radon to determine whether they are more sensitive than adults. scientific studies of other types of radiation exposure indicate that children are more sensitive. an epa report on the subject concludes that "children could be more at risk than adults from exposure to radon". certain states. such as maryland. are already seeking funds to undertake a survey of radon levels in elementary schools. i am considering introducing legislation later this week or early next year which would require epa to work with the state departments of health to perform inexpensive tests to determine if high radon levels exist in schools. therefore i would ask the floor managers of this portion of the bill whether they would be willing to modify the directive to epa to instruct the agency to undertake a pilot survey of schools as part of the national radon survey. in addition. i would ask that the technical guidance manual on radon mitigation techniques. which is directed to be published by the portion of the bill restoring the radon research program. take account of the special conditions that may exist in mitigating radon in school buildings. i would ask the distinguished senators from utah and vermont to assure this senator that they will strive to keep these new directives in the final bill that is enacted this year.

if i may suggest a specific example of the crucial point just made by the senator from vermont. on page 21 of house report 99763. it says. in relevant part: the ... standard requires the agency to determine what actions are necessary to protect human health and the environment. ... the agency must establish the levels of protection that are necessary to protect -ihuman health and the environment and the response actions that are necessary to achieve such levels. (emphasis added) use of the term "necessary" to qualify measures designed to meet the standard is a mistake. it may be viewed as a limitation on the authority of the agency to impose requirements. although such a formulation is  a limitation in the context of rcra. we have seen some regulated parties argue that the agency can impose a requirement unless the agency can prove such requirement is necessary. that is  the intent of rcra  of this bill. to avoid confusion. what we have done here is. in effect. rewrite the house legislative history. using the same example. that passage would  read: the  . . standard requires the agency to determine what actions shall be required to protect ... the agency must establish the levels of protection that will protect human health and the environment and the response actions that will achieve such levels.

i agree with my able colleague that we do have such a responsibility to the indian people and expect that the amendment will focus the efforts of epa. the indian health service. the bureau of indian affairs and other relevant agencies in aiding indian tribes and native villages to. improve their sewage treatment facilities and to protect the quality of their waters.
. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the record. there being on objection. the bill was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows: s. 2935 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the "antibiotic safety act of 1986". sec. 2. (a) section 501 of the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph: "(j)(1) if it is an animal feed and it bears or contains a subtherapeutic dose of penicillin. chlortetracycline. or oxytetracycline. "(2) for purposes of subparagraph (1). the term subtherapeutic dose means a dose of penicillin. chlortetracycline. or oxytetracycline which is administered for a purpose other than the treatment of a specific disease or disorder. including for the purposes of promoting the growth of an animal or preventing disease in an animal.". (b) section 201(x) of such act is amended by inserting "in section 501(j)." before "in section 512". by mr. pell (for himself. mr. chafee. and mr. weicker):
. the conference report before us today also makes a number of critical. changes in the medicaid program.. first. it would expand coverage to pregnant women and children under the age of 5 who are beneath the federal poverty level. this provision will address the serious problem of infant mortality and low birth weight among babies. it reflect legislation introduced in the senate early this year which i cosponsored. under current law. states that wish to provide essential health care under medicaid to poor women and infants. can only provide such services to those who are eligible for cash welfare. as a result. health care services offered through medicaid reach fewer than onehalf of all infants living in poverty. under the conference agreement. states will have the option of providing prenatal. delivery. and postpartum care to lowincome pregnant women and medical assistance to lowincome infants and children under 6 years of age in families living below the federal poverty level without requiring that they also meet the eligibility standards for aid to families with dependent children. eleven babies die out of every 1.000 infants born in this country. few events are as tragic as the death of a baby or the birth of a baby with birth defectsespecially when such an outcome could have been prevented with proper prenatal care. the national academy of sciences estimates a costbenefit ratio of $3.38 saved in the first year of a childs life for $1 spent in prenatal care. the conference agreement recognizes that even in times of fiscal restraint. it is good federal policy to invest in the health of poor mothers and children. the conference agreement also allows states to provide medicaid coverage to elderly and disabled individuals whose familiy income is at or below the federal poverty level without liking such coverage to eligibility for federal or state supplemental security income payments. aher provision makes it clear that a state can impose any residence requirement which excludes from medicaid an otherwise eligible individual who lives in a state regardless of whether or  such residence is a permanent address. this.provision ensures that "homeless" individuals are  discriminated against. finally. the senate conferees adopted a provision in the house reconciliation package which would enact a piece of s. 2209. the disabled person act. of which i am a cosponsor. this provision is a great importance to disabled americans who want the opportunity to be productive members of the work community. by enacting this -provision congress will finally. ackledge that individuals with disabilities should be supported and assisted in their efforts to join the work force rather than discouraged because they can afford the high cost of their disabilityrelated health care needs without some help from federal programs. i fully support efforts to encourage disabled individuals who wish to join the work force to have the chance to do so. but we must.be certain that barriers that discourage their participation. such as the possible loss of ssi or medicaid benefits. are eliminated. access to the work community is critical in order to assist disabled persons to pursue full and active lives. we are in an era of changing techogy and experience. our understanding of the capabilities of those with disabilities is changing quickly. we have made tremendous strides in our ability to help those with disabilities to learn and to participate in many different facets of life. these individuals represents a highly motivated. dependable work force. this provi-. sion will give them the opportunity to fulfill their potential.
. i am concerned with the level of appropriations for the maternal and child health block grant. under the current year. there is being spent the $373 million that was appropriated with the block grant last year and $105 million which came under thesupplement. which makes a total for the maternal and child health care of $478 million. as i understand the appropriation that is before us  in this area. it is $425 million. which is some $60 million less than what has been appropriated for the current year. so it would be my inclinationbut i should like to hear from the distinguished manager of this billto seek additional funds for the maternal and child health. to bring it up to the neighborhood of $490 million that we have appropriated in the current year. i wonder whether the distinguished manager could give me some assistance or enlightenment on this matter. i feel that this is an extremely effective program. basically. it is a preventive health program. it is trying to keep the mothers and the children of the poor healthy. before they catch any potential illnesses early. so that they can receive the services under this program. whether it is immunization or medical care. so that the disastrous illnesses or the debilitating effects that might follow can be forestalled. i k of the great interest of the manager of the bill in this area. and i would appreciate his thoughts on additional funds for this matter.
. i am pleased today to introduce legislation which provides congress with an opportunity to reexamine the current system of care provided for the severely disabled in our country. the comnmunity and family living amiendments act will gradually shift the federal share of medicaid funds from institutions to coumunitybased integrated settings. while this legislation would  propose to close institutions. it is designed to encourage states to reduce the number of persons living in institutions by providing community living. arrangements. services funded through the federal medicaid program to the severely disabled gradually would have to be provided in a community environment. under this act. services to the disabled would be more individualized. providing for the special needs of each person. those individuals needing highly structured 24hour care. including medical attention. would be provided with this care in facilities within communities. those needing fewer services. whether living at home. in foster care. in a group home. or in an apartment would also be provided with appropriate medical attention. federal medicaid dollars would be phased out from some institutions over a 10year period according to a plan developed for each institution. the plan would identify a specific amount of federal medicaid funds to be phasedout of the institution for each 6month period during the 10 years. facilities with 16 to 75 residents that opened after january 1. 1979. would have 15 years rather than 10 years before their medicaid funding would end. all medicaidfunded facilities for 15 or fewer residents that were in operation as of january 1. 1983. would  be affected by the iequirement for phasing out federal medicaid funds. the 6month phaseout target figures would be based on the unique situations facing each institution and nursing home and would take into account such factors as the size of the institutions population. the severity of its residents disabilities. and the availability of community services. following the phaseout. the federal medicaid program could only continue to fund temporary institutionalizationup to two years per personwhen such institutionalization is considered unavoidable. the federal medicaid match would be increased by 5 percent for each disabled person who is removed from an institution - and placed into a community living facility. the increment would continue for each of the first 5 years following a persons return to the community.  only will the bill provide a new way of caring for those in our society who have disabilities. it will also provide protections for those people. for instance. the proposal will require systematic and independently contracted evaluations of all care provided in all institutional and community settings. aher provision would require that a written plan be developed for all of the services required by each individual. this plan. wvhich must be revised at least once a year. would be developed with the individuals participation and with participation of his or her parents. guardians. or nextofkin. i have outlined today only a few elements of this bill. there are other important areas which the bill addresses. there will be those who will oppose this idea. at least in the outset. and i believe it is important for a very complete discussion to take place between those who support and oppose this concept of care. it is my hope that after debate. research. and discussion. my colleagues will support this bill. i hope that this process will improve it. but i am convinced that the need for an examination of the care provided to the severely disabled is desperately needed. and i strongly believe that this bill is an appropriate starting place. by mr. symms:
. in my own state of rhode islandwhich. i believe. operates one of the best programs in the nationthe effects of lower funding would be devastating. and rhode islands case is representative of the nations. in rhode island alone. several thousand fewer women would receive pre- and perinatal care. thousands of children would  receive well care or home health care or be able to participate in a leadpoisoning program. do we want to go back to the days when hundreds of thousands of children suffered brain damage because they ingested leadbased paint and were  adequately screened or treated. i do  believe that we do. especially when such horrid effects can be prevented. if the costs in human terms are  convincing egh evidence that maternal and child health warrants our help. then the dollars and cents figure will make the point. in 1977. gao reported that the cost of genetic screening at birth. along with early treatment of seven common disorders. was less than oneeighth the cost of caring for an impaired child over a lifetime. in texas. a recent study showed that each $1 spent on preventive care for children resulted in an $8 savings in longterm costs. basic vaccinationswhich as many as 40 percent of your american children still do  receiveare emously cost effective. the center for disease control has estimated that the $180 million we spent on the measles vaccination. program between 1966 and 1974 saved $1.3 billion in medical and longterm care costs. this says hing of the reduction in instances of deafness. retardation. and other crippling effects that has occurred. maternal and child health dollars are  only dollars well spent. but they are dollars which we can afford  to spend. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
ial commission on drunk driving. the lautenbergdanforth amendment recognizes the need for this combined approach by establishing a program of modest rewards for states which adopt mandatory license suspension as a penalty for drunk driving. narrowing the discretion of judges in setting penalties for drunk driving is extremely important in deterring violators. in addition. computerized safety recordkeeping systems are an effective intrastate enforcement tool which this amendment would encourage through incentive grants. this proposal also includes an incentive for the states to establish programs to combat the problem of drugged driving. the administration has expressed its strong support for the lautenbergdanforth proposal. and similar legislation has been approved in the house. passage of this amendment will thus provide the best opportunity for positive congressional action this year in the fight against drunk driving. i believe we must continue to examine carefully the comprehensive measures recommended in the cotnmission report. and to closely monitor the progress of the states in responding to these suggestions. congress should be prepared to approve stronger incentives to encourage mandatory license suspensions and other deterrents in the future. alcohol abuse and its potential for resulting in tragedy on our highways will  disappear. our efforts to grapple with the problem must  end with the conclusion of this debate. i look forward to joining my colleagues in a continuing effort to reduce death on our nations highways due to drunk driving.e
. i am pleased to offer legislation today that would require businesses to include childrens preventive care and health supervision services in their employee health plans. such services would be required for the insurance premiums to he deductible as a business expense. few americans woulil disagree with the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." yet our present system of health care clearly contradicts this proposition. employ:r group health insurance has become the dominant method of financing personal health care services in this country. over 90 percent of all employment groups  have some form of private health insurance. but what is the focus of this insurance. the focus is on acute care needsa sickness insurance system w hose costs are out of control. rather than a true heulth insurance system that would avoid unnecessary illnesses. here is this focus less appropriate than when it is applied to children. unfortunately. group health insurance plans have been given ilcentive to cover and to encourage the services children need. we need to redesign the system to encourage vaccines. $7.40 was saved. young families with children generally have limited incomes and must rely heavily on their employerprovided health insurance. if he plan excludes coverage of preventive health care. such as immuniznations. for children. many families will wait for sertous symptoms to appear before payilg outofpocket for care. the average monthly cost per family for this additional coverage would be $2.28. coverage would extend only to a schedule of accepted and recommended examinations and immunizations. tile cost for all recommended services from birth through the age of 20 is approximately equal to the cost of 1 day in the hospital. the pediatric health care incentive tax act is designed to reverse tile costly insurance emphasis on hospitalisation and aicknessonly coverage. and to create costeffective incentives for prevention and health maintenance. support for this measure will come from all groups in our society who feel as i do: that our children are our most important and precious asset and that their health must be protected.e by mr. symms (for himself. mr. dixon. mr. mcclure. mr. borst and mr. helms)
yes. senator. i do. it would  be proper to require that impoundment to be closed out permanently prematurely if it can handle wastes that are  hazardous wastes while being protective of human health and the environment. s mr. randolph. i thank the senator.e
 of family health international. approximately "the cost of a small order of mcdonalds french fries per person per year" on all aspects of reproductive research. as recently as 30 years ago. research was being done on contraception. it was  until 1968 that the center for population research within the national institutes of health was created. in 1983 funding for the center was $86 million. in 1972 it was $85 million. only $8.6 million of this actually goes toward contraceptive development. the remainder toward basic research in reproductive sciences. the $8.6 million is a particularly insignificant sum when one considers that. according to mr. potts. it can "cost up to $50 million and take more than 10 years of research" to bring a new contraceptive to the market. in the past. industry was largely responsible for the research and development of many of the currently available contraceptives. however. industry is  far less excited about expending the effort to conduct new research and development because the cost and time involved from initial development to approval of marketing by the food and drug administrationfdais a deterrent. pharmaceutical companies would rather concentrate on developing drugs to treat disease than drugs and devices to prevent pregnancies given the cost and the time. recently. the ford foundation and the canadian international development research council. which made major contributions to contraceptive research. have withdrawn their support in light of the dwindling concern about the relative importance of problems of population growth. there seems to be far more concern about abortion than about prevention of unwanted pregnancies. its ironic that the abortion controversy works against contraceptive research instead of in its favor. the future of contraceptive research is  bright. despite the need to make it a priority. that is why i am today introducing legislation which requires the national institutes of health to conduct research on. and develop better means of contraception. requiring the national institute of healths institute of child health and human developmentwhich includes the center for population researchto use at least 10 percent of its budget for new research and development would spur the search for safe and effective means of birth control. the office of techogy assessment recommends that $20 million more a year be spent on contraceptive research. and the 10percent minimum provided in this bill would implement this recommendation. every child has a right to be wanted. women and men need safe and effective methods of birth control. a large number of the millions of unwanted pregnancies and resulting abortions that occur each year can be prevented. i invite my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
yes. if the administrator of the environmental protec. tion agency determines. after ice and an opportunity for hearing in the affected areas. that placement of the waste would be protective of human health and environment. and if the administrator establishes performance and permitting standards for such facilities. then the agency can issue a disposal permit.
. i am pleased to offer legislation today that will require businesses to include chils drens preventive care and health sui pervision services in their employee health benefit packages. such services would be required for the insurance e premiums to be deductible as a business expense. employer group health insurance plans are the major method of financing health care in the united states. over 9a percent of all employment groups  have some form of private health insurance. few americans would disagree with the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." yet our present system of health care contradicts this proposition. unfortunately. most coverage provided by health insurance plans is aimed at acute care.  preventive care. the result is an acute care system. in which costs are out of control. rather than a true health insurance system that would avoid unnecessary illnesses. here is this focus less appropriate than when it is applied to children. unfortunately. group health insurance plans have been given incentive to cover the services children need most. the legislation i am introducing today. the child health incentives reform plan [chirp]. focuses on children for a simple reason. more than any other age group in the population. children require regular preventive care and screening to detect and prevent disease and disorders. preventive care  only improves their overall health but it is also cost effective. more than one study has shown that immunizations save money in the long run. results indicate that for every dollar spent on measles vaccinations. $10 was saved and for every dollar spent on mumps vaccinations. $7.40 was saved. other studies have demonstrated that eligible medicaid children provided with early and periodic screening. diagis. and treatment [epsdti had 30 to 50 percent lower hospital and medical costs than other medicaid children. opponents to health insurance coverage for preventive services for chil* dren argue that regular health screenings are a budgetable expense. however. young families with children generally have limited incomes and must rely heavily on their employerprovided health insurance. if the plan does  cover preventive health care. such as immunizations. many families will wait for serious symptoms to appear before paying for care. the sad truth is that 24 percert of all preschoolage children are  immunized. besides the tragic diminution in the quality of life for a child left retarded by measles. the cost of lifetime institutional care can be staggering. the childrens defense tmd estimates the cost at between $500.000 and $1.000.000. the average monthly cost per family for the additional coverage outlined in the bill would be at the most $2.28. or about 1 percent of the employers current payment. the cost for all recommended services from birth through the age of 20 is approximately equal to the cost of i day in the hospital. i believe that this is an important step to take and support for this measure will come from all groups in our society who feel as i do: that our children are our most important and precious asset and that their health must be protected.e by mr. deconcini (for himself. mr. kennedy. mr. pell.
. i am just assuming that the amendment that we are discussing is the one that the senator will present. and that it is in the form that the senator has described and answered questions about. first of all. let me ask one thing about this amendment. i k that we are upset about the midwestern farmers. that is where the problem is. does this amendment go beyond that. does it cover tobacco and peanuts. for example.
. the amendment before us is the result of a great deal of discussion by those of us who were concerned about the original cuts in medicare and medicaid proposed in the white housesenate agreement. this amendment eliminates all references to a cap on the medicaid program and reduces the savings mark for the finance committee in this program to $1.2 billion over 3 years. i believe we can reach this mark with changes which will  adversely affect those who need the program the most. the amendment also reduces the increase in the premium for part b from 35 percent to 30 percent over 5 years and eliminates the home health copayment requirement. overall. the amendment reduces the savings mark for the finance committee to meet through savings in the medicare and medicaid programs from approximately $20 billion to $17.5 billion. a mark i believe the committee can meet without great difficulty. throughout this process. i have been very concerned about the impact of the spending reduction marks. initially. they were simply too large to achieve without having an extremely adverse affect on the elderly. disabled and poor. i was especially concerned about the proposed cap on the medicaid program. under the cap each state would have received only what it is currently getting from the federal side of the equation adjusted for medical services inflation. the federal match for all practical purposes would be eliminated and the program would be changed from an entitlement to a block grant. a cap means that states would  be able to increase eligibility or services. one of the populations which would have been severely affected by the cap proposal is the elderely. longterm care services for the elderly alone account for almost onehalf of the cost of the medicaid program. medicaid assumed this role by defaultmany. elderly individuals who are in nursing homes entered as private pay payors. once their savings become depletedthey had gone through all of their savings and assetsthey ended up on medicaid. half of all nursing home residents are the newly impoverished. as my hearings on longevity clearly indicated. the projected increases in the elderly population. . especially those over 85. are astounding. this means that the number of elderly indi.viduals who require longterm care will be rapidly growing. if a medicaid cap were a part of this package. it would mean that states would have difficulty in providing care to this growing population. aher affected population is the developmentally disabled. more of these individuals would end up in institutions under a cap because the states would  be able to pay for expanded community based services. a medicaid cap would place emous pressures on the states to limit their benefits package to emergency services and basic hospital. nursing home and physician care. the development of community based alternatives and preventive health care services would be harmed. in short. a cap would  take into account changing demographic patterns and needs among the various states. such as increases in the elderly population at risk of nursing home placement or increases in the number of unemployed or working poor families. overall. i am pleased with this amendment. it is a workable and satisfactory compromiseone which i hope all of my colleagues will support.
 of family health international. we spend approximately "the cost of a small order of mcdonalds french fries per person per year" on all aspects of reproductive research. i believe this is grossly inadequate. as recently as 30 years ago. there was research on contraception. it was  until 1968 that the center for population research was created within the national institutes of health. in 1972 funding for the center was $85 million: in 1983 it was $86 million. only $8.6 million of these funds are actually used in contraceptive development. the remaining funds are spent on basic research in reproductive sciences. this amount is particularly inadequate when one considers that. according to mr. potts. it can. cost up to $50 million and take more than 10 years of research to bring a new contraceptive to the market. in the past. the pharmaceutical industry was largely responsible for the research and development of many currently available contraceptives. unfortunately. many of these companies do  find this type of product to be worth the time and money involved in obtaining approval by the fda. pharmaceutical companies would rather concentrate on developing drugs to treat disease than drugs and devices to prevent pregnancies given the cost and time. the future of contraceptive research is  bright. despite the need to make it a priority. that is why i am introducing this legislation today. every child has a right to be wanted. women and men need safe and effective methods of birth control. a large number of the millions of unwanted pregnancies that occur each year can be prevented with new and improved methods of contraception. by mr. helms (for himself. mr. east. and mr. denton):
. today. with senator rudman. i am introducing legislation that seeks to improve the lives of children worldwide. this legislation will earmark.  appropriate. $30 million in the agriculture. rural development and nutrition account of the fiscal year 1986 budget of the agency for international development [aid]. disbursed over 3 years. this money will fund nutrition programs which reduce vitamin a deficiency. an estimated 500.000 children in developing countries go blind each year because they do  get egh vitamin a. ten million . children suffer from this nutritional disorder annually. it occurs in bangladesh. india. indonesia. the philippines. haiti. latin america. and africa. the world health organization considers vitamin a deficiency a public health problem in 73 countries and territories. approximately 35 million of the worlds 42.2 million blind live in developing nations. that number is expected to double by the end of the century. blindness can be easily prevented but programs to prevent have lacked support. blindness resulting from vitamin a deficiency occurs when the lack of vitamin a is quite severe. before blindness occurs. damage to the intestinal tract and respiratory system causes illness and death from increased susceptibility to such diseases as measles. gastrointestinal problems. and pneumonia. therefore. vitamin a is crucially important to maintaining overall health for children in less developed countries. the need to prevent vitamin deficiency has never been greater. in africa. in particular. up to 10 percent of the childrep in the feeding camps of ethiopia and the sudan are becoming irreversibly blind through vitamin a deficiencies. johns hopkins university conducted a study in 420 indonesian villages with funds from aid. 30.000 randomly selected children given vitamin a had death rates onethird lower than those who did  receive the supplement. golden bullets is what international relief workers call a large dose vitamin a capsule. this capsule is the size of a pea. does  need refrigeration and need only be administered once every 6 months. one vitamin a capsule costs only 2 to 4 cents each and is heralded by the helen keller institute as the solution that will head off the devastating damage that children suffer from vitamin a deficiency. helen keller international and the international eye foundation are the two leading organizations involved. in vitamin a programs. both agencies strongly support this legislation. and believe that $30 million could be efficiently allocated for the implementation of vitamin a activities. following is a chart summarizing proposals for expanded activities which was developed in consultation with aid. the world health organization [who). and helen keller international.
. i. am pleased to join my colleagues from minnesota and pennsylvania in introducing the fair medicare appeals act of 1985. under current law there is a difference between the manner in which disputes concerning the amount of benefits under part a and part b of medicare are resolved. there is a twotrack system for the appeal of carrier decisions. under part a if a beneficiary has a dispute with a provider. he or she may appeal the decision by the carrier to an administrative law judge. if the dispute involves more than $1.000 the beneficiary may appeal the administrative law judges decision through full judicial review. on the other hand. if there is a dispute under part b of the program. the beneficiary is entitled only to receive a hearing with a hearing officer who is  a lawyer. is employed by the carrier. and works out of a manualwith consideration of case law or even previous decisions made by the carrier. the carriers decision is final. there is appeal. this legislation would make four major changes in the part b appeals process. disputes involving amounts between $100 and $500 will continue to be settled by the carrier. disputes involving amounts between $500 and $1.000 will have recourse to a full hearing by an administrative law judge. if the amount in dispute is greater than $1.000. a beneficiary may appeal the administrative law judges decision through full judicial review. finally. all beneficiaries will have the right to choose representation by their providers in any appeals procedures under part a and part b. the difference beween these two appeal procedures was  a problem when the part b program was small. however. today with the increased complexity and increased number of claims the difference is difficult to justify. the current part b appeals process was designed 20 years ago. it has been 13 years since congress last took a serious look at medicare appeals procedures and procedural protections. i believe it is time to reexamine the system and make muchneeded reforms. part b of medicare has become an integral part of health care for the elderly. congresi has added services under the program to address the changing needs of the elderly. with the advent of prospective payment system under part a of medicare. beneficiaries rely heavily on the services offered under part b. that system has created pressures on hospitals to discharge patients sooner than in the past and consequently beneficiaries need the services of posthospital providers. which are paid for through part b of the program. like physician and home health care services. in addition to these demands. advances in medical techogy have made possible the performance of many surgical procedures on an outpatient basis. techogical advances have also created increased availability and demand for beneficiaries to receive medical care in their homes rather than in hospitals or other institutional settings. in short. the medicare program has changed dramatically in both structure and nature since its beginnings 20 years ago. yet beneficiary and provider protections have  kept up with these changes. as congress continues to reform and restructure the medicare program. our goals must be high quality of care. fair administration of benefits. appropriate payment of benefits. and a speedy and fair resolution of disputes. the fair medicare appeals act of 1985 will further these goals.e by mr. heinz:
. i would like to bring to the attention of the senate the following september 5. 1985. new york times article about the perils of vitamin a deficiency among the children in developing countries. this article clearly points out the need for the legislation senator rudman and i have introduced. our legislation. s. 1451. would earmark $30 million in the agriculture. rural development. and nutrition account of the aid budget to be disbursed over a 3year period. for nutrition programs which reduce vitamin a deficiency. we believe the cost to be minimal in terms of the benefit it provides to children worldwide. i call on my colleagues to read the following article and add their names as cosponsors to this important legislation. i ask that the article be printed in the record at this point.
. one of the people most overlooked in this event was joes mother. barbara cons. soon after joes birth. barbara cons lost her husband. she has six children. joe is the youngest. she raised her children on her own. being a parent is  easy in the best of circumstances. but when you have a child with special needs. it takes even more energy. patience and love. barbara cons believes in joes abilities and potential. that belief has been the most essential part of joes development. some people would say that joe is an exceptional case. that other people with his disability could  do the same. i would suggest. however. that if joe is extraordinary. it was because his family never gave up on him. because he had the advantage of living at home.  in an institution. because he had the advantage of being born late egh that he had the chance to attend school with handicapped children. because he had the support friendship and encouragement from older brothers and sisters at home. joe is an example of how lives can be changed with the simple passage of important legislationin his case the passage of the education for all handicapped children act of 1973. the next step is to ensure that medicaid funds are available and widely used in institutional settingsa situation that does  exist today. i hope that all of my colleagues in congress will remember joe and his experiences here as we consider legislation that affects disabled individuals. there are people like joe all over this country. in all of our communities. they deserve a chance that we are  giving them todaya chance to grow. to flourish and to become part of society. each of us should have the opportunity to work and live our lives with dignity. we should be challenged and given the chance to feel good about our achievements. joe and the hundreds of thousands of individuals like him in our country today have a contribution to make to society. i hope that everyone who has been touched by joethrough meeting him or seeing him on televisidnwill think seriously about giving them that chance. which is through legislation that we have spohsored here to provide that medicaid funds can be used for those who are living in the community rather than solely in institutions.
. today i am pleased to join senator andrews in cosponsoring s. 1446. this bill will improve and extend veterans health benefits for those men who were taken as prisoners of war while serving our nation. this past september. i had the pleasure of hosting the rhode island veterans forum. which i created to advise me on issues of concern to the veterans community. among the issues raised was the need to expand the scope of illnesses. for which pows may be treated under the veterans health care program. this bill does exactly that. american veterans deserve the finest and most comprehensive medical care available. and with this bill. their coverage will be extended to include care for injuries associated with the pains and illnesses that pows often suffer as a result of extended incarceration at enemy hands. this legislation helps compensate our former pows for the sacrifices they have made while defending democratic institutions abroad. i urge all of my colleagues in the senate to join senator andrews and myself in helping american pows by supporting this bill.
. i would like to discuss briefly s. 873. the community and family living amendments of 1985. which i introduced in april of this year. i believe that reform of the medicaid system as it applies to the developmentally. disabled is long overdue. consequently. i introduced the community and family living amendments. s. 873. in april of this year. this legislation is a revised and refined version of s. 2053 which i introduced in 1983. a policy change at the federal level is long overdue. federal medicaid funds flow primarily toward large facilities. since 1977. less than 20 percent of the dollars for intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded have gone to support persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities in the community. while there is a great deal of interest in supporting people in the community and removing the emphasis on institutional care. there is much variation in the rate at which states approach the task. since 1977. more than onehalf of the residents of large facilities in vermont. michigan. ohio. and nebraska have returned to the community. in other states. this figure is less than 10 percent. three stateslouisiana. tennessee. and mississippihave actually increased the number of persons living in institutions in the last 7 years. my legislation is an attempt to encourage all states to move in the direction of allowing individuals with developmental disabilities to live in the community. either at home. on their own or in a group home. my bill makes this possible by providing resources to the states to offer a better level of care than that available in most larger facilities. the past year has proven that any proposal to phase down medicaid support for institutions and increase such support for community based services is a highly charged issue. clearly the idea evokes tremendous emotion and controversy. most of the debates about the bill tend to revolve solely around whether institutions are good or bad. i believe those debates are a waste of time. the real issue is whether we can improve our current system of care. i believe that s. 873 contains the necessary elements of such a reform. id like to spend a few moments talking about the provisions of my legislationmany of which are iged in the heat of these debates. some critics say that my proposal will allow only one kind of service. everyone must be in a 12- or 15bed group home. hing could be further from the truth. my bill will allow medicaid expenditures to support people in a wide variety of settings: their family home. foster homes. adoptive homes. special living arrangements for 2 or 3 or more people with special needs. new community residences up to about 12 people. existing residences up to 15. and existing clusters of up to three homes. in addition. s. 873 would allow approximately 15 percent of a states total medicaid budget to be used to support facilities which are larger than those i have just outlined. thus i offer. for the first time. a continuum of services. what more could we ask for. some critics of my bill argue that it proposes dumping people from institutions into the streets without needed services. however. under my bill. there are services which states must provide to each person who is deinstitutionalized: respite care. personal attendant care as appropriate. case management. and protection and advocacy services. my bill says that each person must have an individual written plan of habilitation. that the plan must be developed by an interdisciplinary team. and that family members. guardians. or. in some cases. the disabled person himself. can participate on that team. my bill further stipulates that any one who is to be moved out of an institution must be given 60 days written ice. opportunity for a due process appeal. and that the services specified in the written plan must be in place before the individual is moved. for the most part what we have seen in the past in the name of deinstitutionalization is really dumping. my bill is an antidumping bill. my bill stands for the proposition that we are moving people back to the communitywe are  moving protoplasm or objects. we are moving people into homes where they can live safely. with the security and support they need along with the opportunity to grow and develop as individuals. my bill says that community residences need to be certified. licensed. or accredited. that staff need to be retrained to work in the community. my bill requires states to develop a plan of action for the next 15 yearsa plan which must be approved by the secretary of health and human services. my bill contains a private right of action clause: if an individual is  being properly served because the state is failing to live up to its agreement in the state plan. the individual may sue. when people state that they oppose my bill. one must ask what provisions of the bill they oppose. are they opposed to independent case management services. are they opposed to written program plans. or 60day ice of moves. are they opposed to respite services or protection and advocacy services. are they opposed to helping families stay together by supporting families who wish to keep their children at home. i hope that my colleagues can see that this is  just a mindless dumping bill. i hope that they can see that we can make deinstitutionalization a reality. given the proper support required by my bill. i hope they can see that by the year 2000. we can live with many fewer institutional placements than we have today. i ask all of my colleagues in the senate to join me in developing a system where each person. matter how disabled. is cared for. supported and served in his or her own communitywhere we all belongtogether.
. in summation. is this: as has been pointed out earlier. a lot has been said on this amendment. i do want to thank those who have spoken in favor .of it. it seems to me we are making two points here. first. we need the revenue. when we are running these horrendous dificits every year. every additional cent. every dollar. every million or billion dollars we can achieve is good for the nation. second. this is a health measure. a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote to improve the health of our nation. there is a direct . correlation between the size of the tax and the amount of smoking. and particularly in connection with young people. the young people are in the group that do  have egh financial elasticity so they can continue to buy cigarettes at the increased price. as has been pointed out. when we went from 8 to 16 cents. there was a fairly dramatic decrease in the number of young people who were smoking. who took up smoking or continued smoking. this is  as great an increase as nearly. passed in the finance commit-. tee. there by a vote of 10 to 8 an increase of 32 cents a pack was defeated. this is a total of 24 cents. i think anybody who has ever had a relative. a friend. or an acquaintance or has seen anybody who suffers from emphysema. which to me is one of the most frightening ailments i have seen. or who has* seen loved ones suffering from cancer of the lungs. cancer of the chest. the heart ailments that are associated with smoking. will realize that we ought to step up and support this amendment. it is  going to solve the problem completely but it will help. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
i share that view. i remember the days when we could  have margarine across the country because i guess the senators from wisconsin. among others. were successful in preventing yellow colored margarine to be sold as margarine. remember. you would have to buy it and you would have a little packet and you would mix it up together. this was to protect the cows in wisconsin. to me that seemed ridiculous. but the chips fell where they fell. indeed. it was subsequently done and i think the cows in wisconsin have done quite well. yes. i think we ought to be getting toward a regime where there are limitations. if milk can be shipped from minnesota to wisconsin. to california. to rhode island or some other place. and the water taken out and then shipped as dried milk. with water addedand i can only assume that there are sufficient health safeguards and. as the senator from minnesota has said. proper labeling and all thatit seems like an idea we ought to investigate. without king all the details of it. to me it strikes me as having merit. but that is  the point. the reason we are here this aftern-
. i would like to thank senator kasten and the staff of the appropriations committee for incorporating my vitamin a legislation into s. 1816. the foreign assistance appropriations bill which has been included in the continuing resolution. the committee has -included language earmarking $8 million in the agriculture. rural development- and nutrition account of the agency for international development [aid]. for the vitamin a deficiency programs. an estimated 500.000 children go blind in developing countries each year because they do  get egh vitamin a. approximately 35 million of the worlds 42.2 million blind live in developing nations. that number is expected to double by the end of the century. blindness can easily be prevented but programs for its prevention have lacked support. before blindness occurs. however. damage to the intestinal tract and respiratory system cause many other illnesses and even death. ten million children suffer from this nutritional disorder annually. the world health organization considers vitamin a deficiency a public health problem in 73 countries and territories. these funds will be used to set up programs worldwide to distribute megadoses of vitamin a and to teach people how to grow foods rich in vitamin a and to prepare those foods properly to ensure nutrient loss. these programs will be administered by aid. the world health organization and the international vitamin a consultative groupkn . as ivacg.
. the reconciliation package before us represents a great deal of hard work and careful discussion. it also contains an extraordinary number of provisions which might be called extraneous by some. but which are extremely important. medicaid for several years . i have been working to reform the medicaid system. specifically. i have been working - to change the program so that medicaid funds can be used for communitybased longterm care services to our citizens with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. in the long run. i believe this system is in need of a major overhaul. the current system is biased toward the use of institutional facilitiesbut we should be working harder to keep handicapped citizens in the community. true medicaid reform. such as what i have proposed in my legislation. s. 873the community and family living amendments of 1985may take years to accomplish. in the meantime. .there are several interim changes that should be made. we were able to include some of these changes during this reconciliation process.
. the pending amendment would have addressed a problem that is an unintended result of the enactment of the medicare prospective payment system. to leave the formula for the medicare part a deductible in its current form truly would be unfair. the prospective payment system established a single rate of payment for hospital based upon the illness to be treatedthe drg rate. this new payment system has created an incentive for hospitals to ecoize. which. in turn. has resulted in shorter hospital stays for medicare beneficiaries. one problem which has developed as a result of these incentives is in the calculation of the part a deductible which the sponsors of this amendment seek to address. currently. the part a deductible is based on the national average cost pay in the hospital. however. because we  pay a flat rate per hospital stay and hospital stays on the average are shorter. the average cost per day for medicare beneficiaries has increased at a tremendous rate due to fixed hospital costs which  must be allocated over a shorter period of time. at the same time health care costs are increasing at only about 10 percent. the part a deductible will increase at about 43 percent over 2 years. last year alone. the part a deductible for medicare increased by an unprecedented 23 percentfrom $400 to $492. the projected increase for 1987 is aher $80which would bring the first day deductible t o $572. the adoption of this amendment would reduce the increase in the part a deductible. while i agree with the intent of the sponsors of this amendment. i was extremely concerned about the prospect of this amendment being offered in the context of the budget resolution for two reasons. first. this is an issue which we can adequately address in the finance committee this year during the reconciliation process. as a member of that committee i intend to work to ensure that we do effectively address the problem. second. i believe that the domenicichiles budget proposal is the most fair and responsible proposal to be considered by congress in the past few years and i was concerned that if this amendment were adopted. then the budget proposal will unravel. i k thatmany of the organizations representing the elderly felt the same way. this is a complicated problem. and one which should be dealt with cautiously and carefully in the finance committeethe committee with jurisdiction. whatever solutions we may adopt will affect the health of the hospital insurance trust fund which may have solvency problems by the mid1990s. i am extremely pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement on this issue. i intend to work closely with my colleagues on the finance committee to ensure that we resolve this troubling problem over the next few months during the reconciliation process.
. the principal thrust of this legislation is to make sure that every disabled individual has the opportunity to reach his or her fullest potential. we believe that this is  true currently in the institutional settings that so many people are forced into because that is the only setting for which medicaid will pay.
. people with disabilities have the right and the need to live in the community. regardless of the severity of their disability. we have the technical skill and the professional expertise to make this right a reality. this is an approach proven in community after community throughout this countryin my own state of rhode island. in michigan. in new hampshire. in utah. and in many other states. i have introduced legislationthe community and family living amendments of 1985. s. 873which would encourage states to develop communitybased services for those with mental or physical impairments. this would be accomplished by phasing down federal medicaid support for large institutions and transferring that support to the community. s. 873. the legislation i am introducing. proposes a complete restructuring of the medicaid program as it relates to those with severe disabilities. the enactment of s. 873 would mean that individuals  living in the community will never have to face the traumatic experience of being placed in an institution simply because there is other place to go. it would mean that families would never be faced with a situation in which they can longer care for their children at home and the only other option is institutionalization. in order for a disabled individual to move back or remain in the community much careful planning is needed. in other words. the transfer from an institution to a communitybased living facility requires planning. under the plan that i have proposed. every institutionalized person with a physical or mental impairment would have a right to have an individually tailored program that best meets their needs for supervision. support. health services. and education. my bill requires written program plans. developed at team meetings. with parent participation. i have stressed the word "program" for a reason. it seems to me we need to stop equating buildings with programs. our society can and must offer a continuum of services. but we do  need large buildings to accomplish this. the ion that big buildings equal better programs has been shown to be false. some states are  yet ready to support some of their most challenging citizens in community settings. that is why the bill i have introduced provides a length of time. a period of 15 years in all. for this transition. . 15 years is a long time. it goes to the end of this century. and. by the end of that time. we certainly ought to be able to have worked out a transfer of most people out of institutions into small communitybased facilities. however. in the legislation. i have provided that 15 percent of the medicaid funds currently going to the states can be used for institutionalization. my -bill gives parents the right to review and appeal any program dealing with their children. if a child is to be moved out before the parent thinks it is rightthat is. moved out of the institutionthen the parent has the right of appeal. my legislation stands for many of the ideals held dear by all of us. those ideals should apply to all americans. but today they do . severely disabled people have been secondclass citizens for too long. locked up in institutions. what we are trying to do is get them out of institutions. this has proven tremendously successful in my state and in other states. as well. when the person is out of the institution in a smaller setting. communitybased setting. that person realizes his or her full potential and learns to do things he or she was never called upon to do in a large institution. so i ask my colleagues to join me and eight other cosponsors of s. 873 in developing a system where each person. matter how disabled. is cared for. supported. and served in the community where we all belongtogether.
. infant mortality and low birthweight among babies are two of the most distressing problems facing our nation. today. i am pleased to join senator bentsen in sponsoring legislation to address these problems. eleven babies die out of every 1.000 infants born in this country. few events could be as tragic as the death of a baby or the birth of a baby with birth defects. many such heartbreaking outcomes could be prevented with proper prenatal care. the future of our nation depends on our children and they deserve a better chance to be born healthy. it has been estimated that half the birth defects which occur in this country could be prevented through proper prenatal care. prenatal services can drastically reduce the frequency of lowbirthweight babies who are 40 times more likely than other infants to die within the first year and who tend to suffer a wide range of longterm health problems. the legislation we are introducing today will improve the delivery of prenatal care and health services to lowincome women and their children. our bill will permit the states to furnish prenatal. delivery. and postpartum care through the medicaid program to lowincome pregnant women and medical assistance to their children under 6 years of age. think of the incalculable human cost which can be avoided if we improve the delivery of prenatal services. in purely ecoic terms. an average investment of $600 for routine prenatal services and counseling could save as much as $120.000 to $200.000 for extended neonatal intensive care and an average of $40.000 per year for 50 years for a disabled person in an institution. the united states has one of the worlds best programs for the treatment of lowbirthweight babies. yet. we have a poor prevention program and our rate of lowbirthweight babies is higher than 11 other countries. according to the national academy of sciences. the rate could be cut by better than a tenth through improved prenatal care. the academy estimates a costbenefit ration of $3.38 saved in the first year of a childs life for $1 spent in prenatal care. under current law. states that want to provide essential health care under medicaid to poor women and infants. only provide services to those who are eligible for cash welfare. therefore. health care services offered through the medicaid program reach fewer than onehalf of all infants living in poverty. the legislation we are introducing today will begin to close this gap. it extends to states the option of providing prenatal. delivery. and post partum care to lowincome pregnant women. in addition. medical assistance can be provided for lowincome infants and children under 6 years of age in families living at the poverty level without requiring that they also meet the eligibility standards for aid to families with dependent children. when infant mortality trends deteriorate as they have in the united states. we must step back and askare our health delivery services adequate and effective. when the united states has poorer pregnancy outcomes than 11 other developed countries. we must ask why. when low birth weight is excessive among the poor. the poorly educated and those that do  receive proper prenatal care. we must take action. our bill is necessary in order to insure that the poor who do  currently receive proper health care services have access to them. it is estimated that this bill will allow states to furnish services to an additional 40.000 lowincome women who currently receive services or at best limited services. even during a time of fiscal restraint it is sound ecoic policy to invest in the health of our poor mothers and children. investment in improved pregnancy outcomes has emous future returns in both human and fiscal terms..
. medicare is the federal program which provides states with the bulk of funding for longterm care services for those who are disabled. currently medicare funds flow primarily toward large facilities such as the ladd school in our state. the reason for this has more to do with what medicaid will pay for than what is the best system of care and services for the individual. the bill that i have introduced. s. 873. stands for the proposition that there ought to be a range of services available for those with mental and physical impairments. it recognizes that the number of disabled individuals who require institutionaltype care is far smaller than the number of those who would benefit from the communitybased services. in other words. if we look at it carefully. we will find that most individuals in institutions can thrive and expand and reach their fullest potential in a smaller setting. in a group home of. say. 5. 10. or perhaps as many as 15 individuals. this bill stands. as i say. for a broad range of services. yes. in this legislation we have provided that 15 percent of the money can go for those who are to be in institutions. i personally think everybody can do better in a community setting. but there is disagreement on this. so in our legislation. following hearingswe have had hearings in chicago. we have had hearings in minneapolis and st. paul. we have had hearings in my state of rhode island and. of course. the hearings here in washingtonit turns out that there is a considerable body of opinion out there that says some individuals can go out into the community. by "going out into the community." i have to make clear what i am talking about. these people are  thrown out in the streets as is sometimes suggested. by "in the community." i mean they are carefully supervised. there is within the group setting those with kledge and experience to monitor the situation. to make sure that those individuals always have the proper
i share senator moynihans deep concern about the deletion of funds for the work incentive program from the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriation bill. it is my hope that the conferees will consider restoring funds to this very important program. the win program is essential to istates efforts to promote selfsufficiency and reduce welfare dependence among .afdc recipients. in rhode island there are approximately 16.000 afdc recipients. 90 percent of whom are women and single parents. and the age of this population is growing younger each year. under fiscal year 1986 funding. the win program in rhode island provided day care assistance. education. job training. and job search services to 2.000 of the eligible afdc population. it would be a mistake to weaken our commitment to assist these young families in their .quest for independence. it is my hope that senate conferees will work to restore funding for the win program when the conference takes place for the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriation bill.

. i have an amendment which i will withhold from offering for the moment. i am confident that we can address my concerns without amending the language of the bill. first. i want to commend my colleagues. the distinguished senators from utah and vermont. for adding $1.300.000 to the fiscal year 1987 appropriation for the environmental protection agency to restore the radon research program. and for adding $1.200.000 to the amount requested for radon activities. i understand that these two additions will increase radon activities by almost 50. percent. the problem of the seepage of radon gas into buildings and homes in emerging as a major environmental problem and could be a leading cause of lung cancer among smokers. a recent gao report concludes that indoor radon contamination is a national problem. already homeowners are beginning to employ contractors to mitigate high radon levels found in their homes. the publication of a technical guidance manual on effective mitigation techniques. provided for in your bill. is essential to assure that money being invested by these homeowners is wisely spent. and is in fact ridding homes of unacceptably high levels of radon. there is a legitimate concern that epas emphasis on exposure surveys to identify radon concentrations in homes may outrun our technical capabilities to correct such problems. unless epa assigns research on radon mitigation techniques a much higher priority. homeowners will inevitably waste money and be victimized by incompetent or unscrupulous contractors. the additional funds you provide will help develop and validate cost effective radon mitigation methods for various types of residential construction. . this brings me to the subject of my concern and my proposal. if i may engage the floor managers of the bill in a short colloquy. it is my understanding that the national radon survey being conducted by epa is aimed exclusively at residences. i would ask the distinguished floor managers if they have also considered the need to determine whether elevated radon levels exist in our schools. kledgeable experts at epa have informed my staff that of all public buildings. schools may be the most likely to suffer from high radon levels because many schools are one story. close to the ground structures. although there are studies of children exposed to radon to determine whether they are more sensitive than adults. scientific studies of other types of radiation exposure indicate that children are more sensitive. an epa report on the subject concludes that "children could be more at risk than adults from exposure to radon". certain states. such as maryland. are already seeking funds to undertake a survey of radon levels in elementary schools. i am considering introducing legislation later this week or early next year which would require epa to work with the state departments of health to perform inexpensive tests to determine if high radon levels exist in schools. therefore i would ask the floor managers of this portion of the bill whether they would be willing to modify the directive to epa to instruct the agency to undertake a pilot survey of schools as part of the national radon survey. in addition. i would ask that the technical guidance manual on radon mitigation techniques. which is directed to be published by the portion of the bill restoring the radon research program. take account of the special conditions that may exist in mitigating radon in school buildings. i would ask the distinguished senators from utah and vermont to assure this senator that they will strive to keep these new directives in the final bill that is enacted this year.

if i may suggest a specific example of the crucial point just made by the senator from vermont. on page 21 of house report 99763. it says. in relevant part: the ... standard requires the agency to determine what actions are necessary to protect human health and the environment. ... the agency must establish the levels of protection that are necessary to protect -ihuman health and the environment and the response actions that are necessary to achieve such levels. (emphasis added) use of the term "necessary" to qualify measures designed to meet the standard is a mistake. it may be viewed as a limitation on the authority of the agency to impose requirements. although such a formulation is  a limitation in the context of rcra. we have seen some regulated parties argue that the agency can impose a requirement unless the agency can prove such requirement is necessary. that is  the intent of rcra  of this bill. to avoid confusion. what we have done here is. in effect. rewrite the house legislative history. using the same example. that passage would  read: the  . . standard requires the agency to determine what actions shall be required to protect ... the agency must establish the levels of protection that will protect human health and the environment and the response actions that will achieve such levels.

i agree with my able colleague that we do have such a responsibility to the indian people and expect that the amendment will focus the efforts of epa. the indian health service. the bureau of indian affairs and other relevant agencies in aiding indian tribes and native villages to. improve their sewage treatment facilities and to protect the quality of their waters.
. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the record. there being on objection. the bill was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows: s. 2935 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the "antibiotic safety act of 1986". sec. 2. (a) section 501 of the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph: "(j)(1) if it is an animal feed and it bears or contains a subtherapeutic dose of penicillin. chlortetracycline. or oxytetracycline. "(2) for purposes of subparagraph (1). the term subtherapeutic dose means a dose of penicillin. chlortetracycline. or oxytetracycline which is administered for a purpose other than the treatment of a specific disease or disorder. including for the purposes of promoting the growth of an animal or preventing disease in an animal.". (b) section 201(x) of such act is amended by inserting "in section 501(j)." before "in section 512". by mr. pell (for himself. mr. chafee. and mr. weicker):
. the conference report before us today also makes a number of critical. changes in the medicaid program.. first. it would expand coverage to pregnant women and children under the age of 5 who are beneath the federal poverty level. this provision will address the serious problem of infant mortality and low birth weight among babies. it reflect legislation introduced in the senate early this year which i cosponsored. under current law. states that wish to provide essential health care under medicaid to poor women and infants. can only provide such services to those who are eligible for cash welfare. as a result. health care services offered through medicaid reach fewer than onehalf of all infants living in poverty. under the conference agreement. states will have the option of providing prenatal. delivery. and postpartum care to lowincome pregnant women and medical assistance to lowincome infants and children under 6 years of age in families living below the federal poverty level without requiring that they also meet the eligibility standards for aid to families with dependent children. eleven babies die out of every 1.000 infants born in this country. few events are as tragic as the death of a baby or the birth of a baby with birth defectsespecially when such an outcome could have been prevented with proper prenatal care. the national academy of sciences estimates a costbenefit ratio of $3.38 saved in the first year of a childs life for $1 spent in prenatal care. the conference agreement recognizes that even in times of fiscal restraint. it is good federal policy to invest in the health of poor mothers and children. the conference agreement also allows states to provide medicaid coverage to elderly and disabled individuals whose familiy income is at or below the federal poverty level without liking such coverage to eligibility for federal or state supplemental security income payments. aher provision makes it clear that a state can impose any residence requirement which excludes from medicaid an otherwise eligible individual who lives in a state regardless of whether or  such residence is a permanent address. this.provision ensures that "homeless" individuals are  discriminated against. finally. the senate conferees adopted a provision in the house reconciliation package which would enact a piece of s. 2209. the disabled person act. of which i am a cosponsor. this provision is a great importance to disabled americans who want the opportunity to be productive members of the work community. by enacting this -provision congress will finally. ackledge that individuals with disabilities should be supported and assisted in their efforts to join the work force rather than discouraged because they can afford the high cost of their disabilityrelated health care needs without some help from federal programs. i fully support efforts to encourage disabled individuals who wish to join the work force to have the chance to do so. but we must.be certain that barriers that discourage their participation. such as the possible loss of ssi or medicaid benefits. are eliminated. access to the work community is critical in order to assist disabled persons to pursue full and active lives. we are in an era of changing techogy and experience. our understanding of the capabilities of those with disabilities is changing quickly. we have made tremendous strides in our ability to help those with disabilities to learn and to participate in many different facets of life. these individuals represents a highly motivated. dependable work force. this provi-. sion will give them the opportunity to fulfill their potential.
. i am pleased to join my colleague from new jersey in introducing legislation designed to further our efforts to reduce the rate of infant deaths and illness in this country. as a member of the senate finance committee and the subcommittee on health one of my highest priorities has been to provide widespread and effective preventive health care for lowincome children. since 1984. we have been slowly moving forward on this issue. in the deficit reduction act of 1984 we were able to include a small expansion of the medicaid program to provide voluntary coverage to children up to the age of 5 in families with incomes below state eligibility standards and mandatory coverage of lowincome women who were pregnant for the first time but were  eligible for medicaid because they would  be eligible for afdc benefits until the child was born. in the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act 1985. we were able to extend prenatal care coverage to all pregnant women who were beneath the state income standards. just last year. in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1986. we included a provision to allow states to cover children up to age 5on a staggered basisand -pregnant women up to the federal poverty level even if those individuals were  eligible for the state afdc program. the legislation we are introducing today would expand .on our previous efforts first. the legislation would accelerate the phasein of children eligible under our provision in sobra. second. it would require that all chil.dren up to age 6 who are below the state eligibility requirements for afdc -receive medicaid benefits by october 1. 1988. those up to age 7 by october 1. 1989. and those up to age 8 by 1990. the last provision of our proposal would allow states to extend medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children up to age one who are below 185 percent of the federal poverty level. infant mortality and low birth weight among babies are two of the most distressing problems facing our nation. eleven babies die out of every 1.000 infants born in this country. few events could be as tragic as the death of a baby or the birth of a child with birth defects that could have been prevented with proper prenatal care. the future of our nation depends on our children and they deserve a better chance to be born healthy. it has been estimated that half the birth defects which occur in this country could be prevented through proper prenatal care. prenatal. services can drastically reduce the frequency of lowbirthweight babies who are 40 times more likely than other infants to die within the first year and who tend to suffer a wide range of longterm health problems. the- legislation we are introducing today will.improve the delivery of prenatal care and health services to lowincome women and their children. think of the incalculable human cost which can be avoided if we improve the delivery of prenatal services. in purely ecoic terms. an average investment of $600 for routine prenatal services and counseling could save as much as $120.000 to $200.000 for extended neonatal intensive care and an average of $40.000 per year for 50 years for a disabled person in an institution. the united states has one of the worlds best programs for the treatment of lowbirthweight babies. yet. we have a poor prevention program and our rate of lowbirthweight babies is higher than 11 other countries. according to the national academy of sciences. the rate could be cut by better than onetenth through improved prenatal care. the academy estimates a costbenefit ratio of $3.38 saved in the first year of a childs life for $1 spent in prenatal care. when infant mortality trends deteriorate as they have in the united states. we must. step back and ask whether our health delivery system is adequate. and effective. when the united states has poorer pregnancy outcomes than 11 other developed countries. we must ask why. when lowbirth weight is excessive among the poor. the poorly educated. and those that do  receive proper prenatal care. we must takeaction. our bill is necessary in order to insure that the poor who do  currently receive proper healthcare services have access to them. even during a time of fiscal restraint it is sound ecoic policy to invest in the health of our poor mothers and children. investment in improved pregnancy outcomes has emous future returns in both human and fiscal terms. i urge all of my colleagues to join us in this effort.0
that is absolutely right. you go to conference and the house says. "we recede in our position." since the senate has position. you are down to zero. it seems to me that is one of the most important provisions or points we should make in support of the amendment of the senator from vermont. thank you. i would like to thank the senator from kentucky. i am perplexed by his statements that i am bringing up amendments and  deferring to him. i am cloaked with humility as soon as he comes on the floor. and he is cognizant of that. i do have a few cigarette amendments that are coming along. but i do that in a humble manner. practically prostrate before him. as a matter of fact. the way we can resolve all of these matters is for him to concede once in a whilei mean just meet me halfway.
. there has been a great deal of discussion lately on the issue of catastrophic health care. in my opinion. any healthrelated crisis which has the potential of forcing an individual or family into or near poverty is catastrophic. probably the most catastrophic health care expenses an elderly individual faces today are those relating to a chronic illness that requires some type of longterm care. while it is true that between 3 and 4 percent of medicare beneficiaries face outofpocket expenses of over $2.000 each year for medicarecovered services. about 5 percent of all elderly individuals are in nursing homes at any one point in time and the lifetime risk of entering a nursing home is about 20 percent. the cost of nursing home services is  covered by the medicare program.  is it covered by private health insurance policies. the average cost of 1 year in a nursing home is approximately $22.000. for most of the elderly. the risk of needing longterm care and entering a nursing home is their most paralyzing fear. they have good reason to be concerned. onehalf of all nursing home payments are outofpocket expenditures by the elderly and almost all the rest are paid by the medicaid program. approximately onehalf of all medicaid recipients in nursing homes were  initially poor. but spent their income and resources on longterm care before becoming eligible for medicaid. elderly individual or couple should be forced into poverty before assistance will be provided for longterm care for a chronic illness or debilitating condition like alzheimers disease. i am pleased to join my colleague from maine in introducing the medicaid community spouse protection act of 1987 which will help elderly couples avoid complete destitution as a result of an illness. spousal impoverishment happens to a husband or wife when one of them must enter a nursing home and can afford to pay the cost of that nursing home. when this occurs the only federal assistance available is through the medicaid program. the medicaid program requires that both members of a couple "spend down" or impoverish themselves before one of them can get help. the program requires that the couple spend all of their savings except for $2.700 and contribute all of their income to the cost of nursing home care except for $25 a month for the individual in the nursing home and  more than $340 a month for the spouse remaining at home. for the spouse remaining at home this amount is hardly egh to pay the cost of shelter and utilities. the legislation we are introducing today will incease the minimum allowance for the spouse remaining at home to $510 a month. the legislation will also allow states to specify a higher amount by giving states the option of dividing the income of the couple in a number of different ways. this bill addresses one small aspect of the longtermcare problem we face in this country. much more must be done to address the growing need for longtermcare services both at home and in institutionalized settings. as the population over the age of 85 grows. so will the need for these services.* by mr. deconcini (for himself and mr. mccain):
. i am pleased to be a sponsor of this legislation. however. i also wish to make it clear that the legislation we are introducing today is simply a first step toward addressing the problem of catastrophic health care expenses. in fact. it is a very small first step. this legislation would place a cap on the amount of outofpocket expenses that the elderly are responsible for under the medicare program. once a beneficiary reaches that cap amount. he or she will  longer be responsible for additional expenditures. in addition. the legislation will limit the number of first day deductibles in the hospital to every calendar year and will eliminate hospital and skilled nursing facility copayments. these changes are needed. however they fall short of providing comprehensive protection for individuals facing catastrophic health care expenses. this proposal does  address the cost of longterm care services. prescription drugs or balance billing by physicians.  does it address the need for an enhancement of the benefits currently available through the medicare program. just as important. the proposal does  address individuals and families under the age of 65 who face catastrophic health care expenses. i have cosponsored this legislation because it is an important starting point for the debate on catastrophic health care expenses. i am willing to work with others to expand the benefits and to consider methods other than a premium to finance them. as the debate on this issue progresses. i believe we must develop a guiding definition of a catastrophic illness expense. in my opinion. any healthrelated crisis which has the potential of forcing an individual or family into or near poverty is catastrophic. while it is true that between 3 and 4 percent of medicare beneficiaries face outofpocket expenses of over $2.000 each year. about 5 percent of all elderly individuals are in nursing homes at any .one point in time and the lifetime risk of entering a nursing home is about 20 percent. the average cost of 1 year in a nursing home is approximately $22.000. for most of the elderly. the risk of needing longterm care and entering a nursing home is their most paralyzing fear. they have good reason to be concerned. onehalf of all nursing home payments are outofpocket expenditures bythe elderly and almost all the rest are paid by -the medicaid program. approximately. onehalf of all medicaid recipients in nursing homes were  initially poor. but spent their income and resources on longterm care before becoming eligible for medicaid. elderly individual or couple should be forced into poverty before assistance will be provided for longterm care for a chronic illness or debilitating condition like alzheimers disease. . i am working on proposals which will address the two most important healthrelated problems the elderly face today: the need for posthospital care. and most critical. the need for a variety of longterm care services. we must also remember that the need for protection from catastrophic illness is  limited to the elderly. those under 65 are also at risk. and the needs of younger families and children with chronic illnesses or disabilities must be addressed. in the near future i will be introducing legislation to address the needs of these. individuals through allowing them to purchase medicaid protection. i have requested information on the cost of this approach from the congressional budget office and will introduce this legislation when the cost estimate is available.  we have our work cut out for us in the senate this year if we are to solve even a fraction of the catastrophic illness problem. the issues are broad and complicated.. and real solutions may be expensive. i look forward to working with my colleagues this year to resolve these troubling problems.* by mr. boschwitz:
 i am pleased to offer legislation today that would require businesses to include childrens preventive care and health supervision services in their employee health benefit packages. such services would be required for the insurance premiums to be deductible as a business expense. i have been concerned for some time about the health care policies in this country. the cost of health care has continued to rise at an astounding rate and its rapidly reaching the point where we simply can  afford to pay for it. for many years our health care system has focused on acute care. we have  spent much of our resources on preventing illness. few americans would disagree with the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." yet our present system of health care clearly contradicts this proposition. it seems to me that we should begin to reverse this costly and dangerous trend. the place to start is with our children. to move in this direction i am introducing. the child health incentives reform plan [chirp]. my legislation would require businesses to include childrens preventive health care in their employee health plans in order for insurance premiums to be tax deductible. this requirement would dramatically alterfor the betterthe quality and cost of health care in the united states for years to come. under chirp. preventive health care would be provided for children under age 18. included would be complete physical examinations. immunizations. laboratory procedures. vision and hearing tests. and developmental and behavioral assessments. the potential bavings are substantial and selfevident: even an optimally liberal series of preventive health care services for a child from birth through age 20 would amount to less than the average cost of 1 day in the hospital. common sense is at the heart of this proposal. employmentbased group health plans. which are tax deductible.  represent the second largest taxpayersupported health program. after medicare. in this country. in 1986 this subsidy cost the federal government $32 billion in lost revenues. because of this special taxdeductible status. group health plans have become the dominant method of financing personal health care services in the united states. more than 90 percent of all employment groups are  covered by some form of private health insurance. unfortunately. the coverage provided by most of these plans is aimed at acute illnesses. few resources are expended to keep individuals out of the hospital (the most expensive end of the spectrum of health care). through covering only the most expensive procedures and care. group health plans discourage preventive care and early diagis of diseaseboth of which can decrease costs. the result of this trend is a "sicknessonly" health care systemthe cost of which is running out of control. the time has come to consider a fundamental "redesign" of these policies. we must move away from the current system of "sicknessonly" care toward a true system of "health" care which emphasizes preventive care and ultimately will hold down health care costs. chirp is an important step in that direction. this proposal recognizes that children are unique in their health care needs which are substantially different than the needs of adults. children under 15 years of age require only about onefourth as much hospitalization as do adults. but they need much more ambulatory care. yet. health insurance plans generally continue to focus on and cover adult needs. but deemphasize the needs of children. young working people with children rely on their employerprovided health insurance to an even greater extent than do older workers. new families generally have less income. it is often difficult to budget. with aftertax dollars. for anything but essential costs of living. such as housing. food. clothing. and transportation. if health insurance plans exclude coverage of wellbaby and child health supervision services. many families will wait for symptoms of illness to appear before bringing their children into a physician. as the two examples below show. this wait can be tragic and ultimately exceedingly expensive. at age 4. billy was taken to a pediatrician for the first time because he had been walking on his toes for several days. the physical examination revealed marked muscle spasm with tetanic contractions pulling his feet down. his neck and jaw muscles were so tight that he could  even talk. a small puncture wound was found under one of billys toes. billys medical history revealed that he had never received his childhood immunizations. tentanus was confirmed when the organism was found in the wound. billy had to be hospitalized for 6 weeks under light anesthesia to prevent lifethreatening spasms. he was fed by tubes and underwent a gradual recoverymortality from tetanus is higher than 50 percent. at age 12. lisa had  seen her doctor for a health supervision visit since she was 6. when finally examined by a physician. a severe scoliosis. curvature of the spine. was discovered. lisa had to be referred to a university hospital for implacement of metal rods along the spine. she was placed in a complete body and head cast and on a pit so she could be continually turned to avoid bed sores and circulatory difficulties. if the scollosis had been diaged a few years earlier. lisa would have required only brief hospitalization. instead. she lay in a cast for nearly a year. had billy and lisa been taken to a pediatrician regularly their problems would have been discovered in a regular preventive care visit. the visit would have cost $15 to $30. the treatment in billys case would have been a simple tetanus vaccination which costs a few dollars. in lisas case the treatment would have required a brief hospital visit. instead. the cost of treating billy and lisa was close to $12.000 each. the enactment of chirp is especially important in light of the fact that millions of american childrenincluding a significant percentage of all preschool childrenstill do  receive vaccinations for measles. 24.4 percent. rubella. 24.8 percent. mumps. 27.3 percent. polio. 21.7 percent. and diphtheriatetanuspertussis. 13.1 percent. immunizations are  generally covered by group health plans. even though there is ample evidence that for every dollar spent on measles vaccinations. $10 is saved. and for every dollar spent on mumps vaccinations. $7.40 is saved. for each dollar spent on screening texas children for congenital malformations. eye and ear problems and preventive dental care. $8 was saved in longterm costs and income loss. but screening also is  generally covered. it is interesting to e that medicaid provides for early and periodic screening. diagis and treatment eepsdt of eligible children. but private health insurance does . it has been found that children screened through epsdt in missouri were on average 33 percent less costly to medicaid than were other children. in ohio. they were 30 percent less costly. in th dakota 40 percent less. and so forth. it would make sense that a similar return on investment in preventive health care would occur in the private sector. more recently evolved health care models such as medicaid and hmos. which cover just 6 percent of the population. recognize the social and ecoic value of providing preventive care for children. in addition. certain inative group health carriers have begun to break the traditional mold: blue shield of pennsylvania was able to begin offering childrens preventive care 4 years ago and union mutual insurance co. offers this coverage with premium increase at all because. a company spokesman explained. "substitution of appropriate preventive care today for acute care services tomorrow will lower medical costs and our policyholders premiums." at most. according to a study conducted by the american academy of pediatrics based on data gathered by a major insurance corporation. the average monthly cost per family for the additional coverage outlined in chirp would be $2.28. or roughly 1 percent of the employers current payment. that compares with the $200plus per month  being expended for sicknesscovered health insurance. and the premium costs for child health supervision do  include credits for reductions in illness and hospitalization that would surely result. if employers and private insurance companies did hing more than add these chirpmandated benefits to their plans. made effort to change other features to offset the small additional costs. and merely passed them along to taxpayers. treasury expenditures for employer group health insurance might increase by approximately 1 percent. however. treasury expenditures for employer group health insurance have been escalating by about 1520 percent annually for two decades . and unless the form of coverage is changed to stimulate preventive care and reduce hospitalization. the federal government stands to suffer much greater losses of revenue than any additional deduction owing to preventive care for children. but more than just money is at stake: children are our most precious asset. they are particularly vulnerable. and their needs are  protected in the second largest of all federal taxpayersupported health care programs. the tax laws have remained neutral with respect to children and. consequently. so have insurance plans. they exclude coverage for immunizationsfor adults as well as children. but few adults need to be immunized against polio. measles. or diphtheria. all children need this protection. . unless the government provides incentives for all insurers to offer preventive and supervisory health care services. it will be difficult to break through the existing design of private health care plans which focus on acute care. individual insurance companies regard preventive services as additive in cost. rather than as a mechanism for longterm savings. changing the tax laws to mandate preventive health care services for children. however. would stimulate redesign of existing plans. such a redesign of our health insurance system would ultimately help control costs by deemphasizing acute care and focusing on preventing illness. by redesigning their health insurance plans. employers can encourage improved efficiency and better cost management. while providing new and overdue equality of benefits for childrens health care at low cost. they can insist on other new features to make all providers and consumers more costconscious of the big ticket items. in the long run. and many believe in the short term as well. preventive care is one method of costeffective use of health care resources. the lack of preventive care for children has resulted in unnecessary disease and disability. unnecessary deaths. unnecessary loss of education. and poorer social. moral. and psychological development than could have been achieved. at the very least. we should remove financial barriers to preventive care of children. through the enactment of chirp. we would permit all insurers. without fear of loss of any competitive. edge. to include the health care services children need in their plans. and make them even more attractive to employer groups. if we can raise the next. generation of children to be aware of the value of preventing illnessthrough periodic checkups. weight control. excercise. education on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse. and other measures which will help ensure healthly minds and bodieswe will be well on our way to a healthier. society with lower health care costs. the future of our nation depends on our children. and they deserve a better chance to survive and to be healthy. i believe that this is an important step to take and support for this measure will come from all groups in our society who feel as i do: that our children are our most important and precious asset and that their health must be protected. i ask unanimous consent that my legislation be printed in full in the
. today i am introducing the community and ambulatory care act of 1987legislation designed to improve the delivery of health care services to medicare beneficiaries outside of institutional settings. this proposal would allow medicare to reimburse community nursing centers for medicare beneficiaries who elect to enroll in their programs. these centers would provide all ambulatory care services  offered under part b of the medicare programexcept physician services. the services would be provided under the supervision of registered nurses. and safeguards to ensure a high quality of care would be provided through the existing peer review organizations. in return for providing these services. the community nursing center will receive 95 percent of the total amount we are  paying for these same services per medicare beneficiary. these centers will work in much the same way as an health maintenance organization [hmc1. as a member of the senate finance committee which has jurisdiction over the medicare program. i have become increasingly concerned about whether we are spending our federal health care dollars effectively and whether the health care services we do provide are those most needed by the elderly and disabled. in recent years we have made a number of major changes in the medicare program. one of the most farreaching changes was development of the prospective payment system which pays hospitals per episode of illness based on diagtic related groups [drgs]. this system. which we are still refining and improving. has removed the inflationary incentives inherent in the old. retrospective cost based reimbursement for hospital care. however. because of the incentive built into this system to discharge medicare patients more. quickly. prospective payment has also created a critical gap in the services available to medicare beneficiaries. when elderly beneficiaries are discharged from the hospital. services desigmed to help them recover and return to their previous life style are sadly lacking. the legislation i am introducing today will help fill this gap by providing a predetermined payment to community nursing organizations designed to provide the services medicare beneficiaries need to fully recover. community nursing organizations will also help more medicare beneficiaries live independently longer by providing inhome assistance to help prevent institutionalization. over the past few years we have begun to explore alternatives to traditional health care systems with the goal of providing choices to those who are supposed to benefit from our federal health care programs. an example of this is our action to allow medicare beneficiaries the option to enroll in an hmo or prepaid health care plan and opt out of the traditional medicare program. this option has already been chosen by 500.000 beneficiariesa tiny portion of the 31 million individuals enrolled in the medicare program. the bill i am introducing today expands on this concept. we must allow the beneficiaries of health care insurance to have greater responsibility and involvement in the delivery of their health care services. we must also continue to allow the medicare program to adapt to inations in health care delivery. and finally. we must encourage the growth of institutional servicessuch as those outlined in this legislationso that we can help elderly individuals remain in their own homes and communities rather than force them to move to a nursing home. flexibility in the use of institutional models of health care is essential for improving the quality of life of the elderly. the community nursing and ambulatory care act makes use of one of the most important assets of our health care system: professional nurses. this legislation recognizes the expanded role nurses can plan in providing primary health care. nurses will be able to provide regular health assessments and posthospital care in a communitybased setting and they will be able to educate their patients. promote health and prevent disease. i hope my colleagues in the senate will join me sponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent tht the bill be printed in the congressional record at this point.

. today i would like to pay tribute to an outstanding federal employee:  of the federal executive council of rhode island for many years. the state ofrhode island has benefited greatly from toms superior leadership. integrity. and direction. i join with all rhode islanders in commending tom fenton for his many accomplishments and in extending best wishes for continued happiness and good health in the years ahead.*
. i would just like to briefly say. first. i always respect the thoughts that are so well expressed by the senator from idaho. he has been an active member of our environment committee and has given these matters a lot of thought. i think it is important that we hear his views. second. i would say that somehow there is a feeling that the folks who get skin cancer are the sun worshippers out there that are laying on the beaches in miami or tucson and soaking up the.sun while they are on vaca-. tion. in this letter to dr. gibbons from dr. kripke. who is at the university of texas system cancer center. this is what she said: the majority of the skin cancer patients we see at the m.d. anderson hospital and tumor institute can be characterized as belonging to the leisure or sunworshiping sets. most of our patients with skin cancer are farmers. ranchers. oil fieldworkers. and people who work on offshore oil rigs. so this is an extremely serious matter that goes way beyond those who lie out in the sun in their bikinis. or whatever they wear or whatever they do  wear. and get some form of skin cancer. i understand that the senator from th carolina would like a couple of minutes. first
. i rise today in support of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome act of 1987legislation to address one of the most serious health epidemics in our history. since the first aids case was identified in 1981. the magnitude of this deadly disease has grown to staggering proportions. according to the centers for disease control. more than 36.500 individuals have been diaged with aids. of these. nearly 21.000 have already died. in new york. where we have 30 percent of the nations aids cases. more than 6.000 individuals have lost their lives to this devastating disease. based on estimates that at least 1.5 m4tlion americans have already been infected with the aids virus. the public health service has projected a sobering picture of the course of the epidemic. by the end of 1991. more than 270.000 cases of aids will have been reported in the united states. and more than 179.000 individuals will have died as a result of aids. heterosexual transmission is expected to account for 7.000 (or more than 9 percent)4of the cases reported in 1991up from the current percentage of 4 pertcent. the incident of pediatric aids is expected to increase .as well. with more than 3.000 cases expected by 1991. while our ultimate hope of arresting this disease lies in the development of a vaccine or an effective drug therapy for aids. neither of these options is likely to be available in the near future. until these remedies are available. we must act to prevent the further spread of the infection and to ensure that those who are infected re.ceive .adequate health care and the best available treatment. the legislation we are today introducing is comprised of three sections which. taken together. represent an important first step in our effort to combat aids. first. our bill would designate aids as a public health emergency under the public health service act. this designation will facilitate aids research by establishing a virus and serum bank through the nih. -as well as an international aids data bank. in addition. this section will facilitate the approval process for promising new aids drugs by authorizing the fda to hire an additional 40 employees. second. this bill will help enusre -that people with aids receive the .most appropriate form of care by assisting states in the reimbursement -of home health services and the coordination of other longterm care services. in addition. this bill would provide for additional training of health professionals in the care and treatment of people with aids. the third portion of our bill .calls for -an aids public nformatioun campaign. currently. the most effective tool we have against aids is -an informed -public. while this bill represents only a first step. it is one that .we .must take immediately. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislat long by mr. glenn:
 of the american optometric association since last june. culminating nearly two decades of volunteer service to optometry and eye care at the local. state. and national levels. dr. ferris has exhibited a commitment to quality vision care and public health that has made him an outstanding and respected leader. while serving his patients and profession. dr. ferris has also found the time to serve his communityfirst as a member of the cranston city council in the 1970s and later as a member of the board of trustees of cranston general hospital. the stated objective of the american optometric association is "to improve the vision care and health of the public and promote the art and science of the profession of optometry." dave ferris professional life has been dedicated to that objective. i am proud to be associated with a man who has done so much to bring better vision care to all americans and pleased that dr. ferris colleagues have hoed a fellow rhode islander with the recognition he so richly deserves.*
. this is an amendment to strike from the -trade bill a costly and illconsidered provision relating to the export of tobacco. joining me as cosponsors are senators stafford. bradley. hatfield. bingaman. simon. and garn. the amendment has the support of the american cancer society. the american heart association. the american lung association. and the u.s. department of agriculture. the provision which we seek to remove would require the federal government to absorb any losses resulting from the export of tobacco under an export -subsidy program. it was added as a socalled technical amendment during committee considerationwhen in reality it. makes a substantial and costly change in u.s. tobacco policy. its effect is to get the federal government back into the business of subsidizing tobaccospecifically. tobacco exports. this flies directly in the face of the policy we adopted in 1982namely. that the tobacco program should be run at net cost to the taxpayer. this change would cost the american taxpayer $39 million over the next 5 years. according to the congressional budget office. and up to $200 million according to the department of agriculture. thus. it is in direct conflict with the existing requirement that the tobacco program be run at cost to the federal governmentthe socalled etcost system. the etcost system. as i mentioned. was adopted by congress in 1982. in response to nc reasing concern that the federal government should  be subsidizing tobacco. under etcost. any losses associated with .the tobacco price support program are paid out of a special fund to which tobacco producers contribute. the new tobacco provision which is in this provision that is here and came through the agriculture committee would change this by shifting the cost of one portion of the tobacco program. namely. export subsidies. back to the taxpayer. its proponents maintain that this simply puts tobacco on the same footing as other commodities that have an export subsidy. it is important to remember. however. that congress deliberately distinguished tobacco from other commodities. by putting it into this etcost system which does  apply to any other commodities and this move. the etcost came at the request of supporters of the tobacco program. the etcost plan was the tobacco interests end of a compromise under which the tobacco price support program would continue. but tobacco growers would have to pay its costs themselves. that was a 1982 compromise. the new tobacco export provision in the trade bill is an effort to sidestep that requirementthe latest in a series of attacks on the etcost system. last year. as my colleagues will remember. we bailed out the tobacco program. at a cost that will exceed $1 billion before all is said and done. i and 33 other members of the senate opposed that plan. but we were defeated.  we are once again being asked to weaken the etcost requirement in what is starting to look like a neverending process.
. the fundamental question here is whether we are going to change the tobacco program from a etcost program to a program that could cost substantial amounts of money. the u.s. department of agriculture estimates $200 million over the next 5 years. that is what this is all about. in 1981. this senate and the congress came within a hairs breadth of eliminating tobacco price supports entirely. the federal support for the tobacco program was going to be eliminated. but supporters of the tobacco program. many of whom are present here today. came forward and said. "do  abolish it. let us keep it. what we will do is we will pay for it ourselves. tobacco will pay its own way." that was how the etcost law came to be developed.  there is a change.  they want to change that. they do  amy longer want to pay their own way. we have a provision in this trade bill to exempt tobacco exports from the ost law. this is a big decision. what we are doing here is getting the federal government back into the tobacco business. there were hearings. debates. as i understand it. and i can be contradicted. there was  a full hearing of this issue. in a little understood provision in the middle of a 1.000page bill comes this provision. as i ed. that once again gets the federal government back into paying for tobacco. what is it going to cost. as i mentioned earlier. the cbo says $39 million. the u.s. department of agriculture says $200 million. but the important point to e here is that cbo says its estimates are very conservative and estimates there would be a mass of sales under this. they have only applied their estimates to the 198586 crop. of course. this would apply to all future crops1987. 1987. without end. so there is a sballing effect of the cost here. i think we are embarking on a vicious circle. a vicious circle by which the federal government can get back into a program. it does good to say tobacco is a commodity and it ought to be treated like all other commodities. the decision has previously been made that it  be treated that way. that it be treated separately. and. that is why. as i ed last evening. it is  entitled to some of the other programs. this is the camel getting its e under the tent. qualifying for this program. i presume. and then they will -come back and try to qualify for the balance. i think the provision is a bad provision and i urge my colleagues to support my amendment
. this legislation is long overdue. americans need to k how to insure that the quality of the air inside their home is healthy. this bill takes a giant step toward addressing the health threat posed by contaminants of the air indoors. i urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this important legislation. by mr. heflin (for himself.

. i am pleased to join a number of my distinguished colleagues in cosponsoring s. 1575. the aids federal policy act of 1987. by providing funding for voluntary. confidential aids testing and counseling. as well as protection against discrimination. this measure represents the solid commitment of this congress to address the aids epidemic with effective and thoughtful action. as of january 12. 1987. 16.667 americans had died of aids. as of october 12. 1987just last weekthe death .toll was 24.698. it is  estimated that 1.5 million americans are infected with the aids virus. among this latter group. the risk of developing aids rises with each year that passes after infection. experts estimate that by the end of 1991. the total :number of cases in this country will reach 270.000with a staggering 179.000 deaths. unless better treatments are found. in the year 1991 alone. it is estimated that 54.000 people will die of aids. .a figure roughly equal to the american death toll of the entire vietnam war. americans have been calling for a national response to this crisis. this is a call i have heard. last june i worked with my republican colleagues to develop an education. treatment and research bill for aids. later. this bill was incorporated into a bipartisan measure. s. 1220. .of which .i am a cosponsor. yet. this bill only addresses part of the issue. as i said last june. "we have a long way to go * * * we must have a sensible approach to testing and counseling through funding of voluntary confidential testing * * * (and) assure that the civil rights of those who have or will develop the disease will  be violated." i am pleased to say that s. 1575 does just that. s. 1575 provides for $400 miwiin for each of the next 4 years to establish and support aids testing and counseling centers throughout the united states. while testing is still  accurate egh to be termed "an answer" for this disease. it has been shown that testing for the aids virus accompanied by .appropriate counseling on preventative behavior is effective in slowing the spread of the disease. this measure mandates strict confidentiality of test results. while still giving physicians and counselors the discretion to disclose information on a limited basis where there is genuine medical need. results can be disclosed to blood banks. the state health officer. spouses and other kn sexual contacts. and health care workers. .the final segment of the bill establishes federal prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of antibody status or diagis in employment. housing. public accommodations. and government services. except when there is a bona fide medical justification for discrimination as prescribed by the centers for .disease control to prevent transmission. s. 1575 is. in my view. a crucial component in the muchneeded federal response to the aids crisis. this legilsation has been supported by the.american medical association. the centers for disease control. and the u.s. surgeon general. it has the backing of virtually every professional health organization. most importantly. it answers -the urgent need for leadership in the midst of this epidemic. and the answer is thoughtful. compassionate. and effective. the challenge we face is immense. to rise to it. we must provide for a national effort to fund research for vaccines and cures. we must provide education. both through the mediaand directly to individuals through counseling and testing in a concerted effort to prevent further infections. we must care for those already sick. we must unite in this effort. preventing medical based discrimination. the combined provisions of s. 1220 .and s. 1575 address all of these goals. together they make up the most comprehensive federal response to this epidemic to date. i am proud to be part of this response. and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in meeting the challenge posed by aids.e
. over the past few months and these changes represented the efforts of the five sponsors to address the concerns we heard from the administration. the elderly. the drug industry. and countless individuals and organizations who shared their concerns with us. i believe that the amendment that we have before us today is a fair and reasonable compromise. all of us have been hearing from our constituents over the past years since we have been in the senate about the issue of catastrophic health insurance. we have been particularly hearing about it since january when the administration proposal was originally presented. it is clear that the elderly have two overriding concerns. first. the cost of longterm care and when they address that. it is  principally hospital care. it is longterm care in a nursing home. second. the cost of prescription drugs. unfortunately. we have had to put off action on longterm care in nursing homes because of the complexity and the potential cost of dealing with the issue. we are doing something about longterm care in the hospital. but frankly we recognize that is but a small part of the total problem. . i however. we are able to deal with the coverage of the cost of prescription drugs. this is a defined problem. we k what we are doing when we are dealing with that and although itis complex. we do have the information we need to act today. because of the cost of prescription drugs. it places an emous strain on the elderly. especially those with moderate incomes. and i believe we have to act and we ought to act this year to mitigate some of that burden. we are  relieving the elderly of the entire burden. there is a minimum cost the elderly must incur every year of $600. so this is gravy train. this is giveaway program.  those aged 65 or older represent only 12 percent of the population. but they consume 30 percent of all prescription drugs. but it even goes further than that. over 75 percent of the elderly use prescription drugs but amongst those with chronic health conditions. the proportion who use prescription drugs of the elderly rises to 90 percent. i call the chairs attention to these extraordinary figures. in 1985. the total expenditure for outpatient drugs amounted to nearly $29 billion. of that amount. $22 billion was paid directly by the patient. $4 billion was paid by private insurers. and $2.7 billion was paid by federal programs. so by far the largest proportion of drug expenditures are paid by the individual. for a medicare beneficiary. for somebody over 65. who must purchase drugs in order to treat an illness or a chronic health problem.  being able to pay for that treatment for the drugs is truly catastrophic. it can result in just plain  buying the prescriptions. and that indeed frequently happens. they say. "we cant afford it. there are other demands on our limited amount of income from social security and so we are  going to buy these prescription drugs." so what that does is it lowers what we might call the quality of life. but that is  a strong egh term. it lowers the ability of that individual to function in an effective manner. to be able to  just get the most out of life. but to be able to serve in a healthy fashion in life and to meet his or her responsibilities and to be able to be of assistance to others and to be able to just plain feel well. so that is the first downside. it impedes the ability of that individual to effectively function and indeed can result in premature death in some instances. but aher factor is also involved and that is that the lack of having the proper drugs sometimes results in that individual going into a hospital for extended care that would  have been required if the individual .had had the proper drugs. especially is this true for those with chronic conditions such as arthritis. high blood pressure. angina. hypertension. heart conditions. diabetes. and ulcers. any one of those that requires a constant steady prescription. if the individual does  take it. by golly. the affliction .comes back and can result in the person going to the hospital. i strongly believe that adding a drug benefit to this bill will go a long way toward meeting potential catastrophic situations. in other words. this is legitimately a part of catastrophic health insurance. the amendment we are proposing today. ideally. would phasein medicare coverage of prescription drugs over a 4year period starting in 1690. in 1990. as has been pointed out. the immuuppressive would come in and the home intraves drugs would be covered. in 1991 and 1992. diuretics and cardiovascular drugs would be covered. we go upward in this. that was in the negotiating process with the administration. you start with a limited number of drugs in 1990. in 1991. you increase those available and do the same in 1992. you stick with a group. 1991. 1992. and then in 1993. all prescription drugs would be covered and there would be this $600 deductible that i mentioned previously. and that is indexed. that will go up. . i prefaced my brief definition of the benefit because in crafting this amendment and in working with the administration and all the concerned parties. we were well aware of all the worstcase scenarios that have been discussed on this floor. i mean. we went through these. as has been pointed out by many of those who question this legislation. is the cost just going to run away. we recognize that. the most pressing concern from the beginning has been about the possibility of the cost of the program escalating at an unreasonable rate. and. frankly. what we were concerned about was what was called disenrollment. in other words. when we pass this legislation. as i hope we will. it will require the beneficiary to buy his regular part b premium. which the individual pays . plus the medicare extended care hospital care. the catastrophic. if you will. premium that is an addition. and on top of that the drug premium. so it is going to cost some added money. as many of the elderly point out. the part b premium is going up already next year by a considerable amount. but we did  want these costs to be so high that the elderly would say. "i am getting out of the whole business." one of the wonderful things about the part b premium  is that 97 percent of the elderly subscribe to it. take that insurance that covers their medical bills. to a considerable extent. 97 percent. and we want that high percentage to take this additional coverage we are providing for hopefully today. so in order to address these concerns so there would  be this disenrollment. we built in the amendment stopgap measure to ensure that costs do  run out of control and that the beneficiaries will  have to pay an unaffordable amount in premiums. we. have included what we call a premium. cap. this means that in any year. if the premium the administration estimates would be necessary to fund the benefit exceeds the cap we have placed in the bill. then the secretary will have broad authority to bring the costs of the program down. and in that authority we have given him a great deal of power. i must say. it shows our confidence in secretary bowen. i am confident that same assuredness will lie with the future secretaries of hhs. he or she. or whoever it might be in the future. will have the broad authority to bring the cost of the program down. including limiting the categories of drugs covered. increasing the deductible. the $600 i mentioned before. and/or the copayments. which are 20 percent. and limiting reimbursement at reasonable levels. some have expressed concern that this will be too expensive for the elderly to bear. i would like to point out a medicare beneficiary would be hard pressed to find any kind of coverage like this in the private sector. i am confident that these premiums. although they will be greater. obviously. than they are . could  be met in the private sector. and that principally comes because there will be so many participating in the programhopefully. 97 percentthat will share the costs. and any medicare beneficiary who believes that better protection can be found elsewhere. of course. can opt out of the program. it is voluntary. i am confident that the program which we begin under this amendment is reasonable and necessary. i believe it is an essential part of any catastrophic bill that this body approves. i urge my colleagues to join in supporting the amendment.
. the reconciliation conference report before us addresses many troubling health care issues in both the medicare and medicaid programs. the original house and senate reconciliation packages contained very substantial differences in their medicare and medicaid provisions. the agreement. before us represents compromise by both the senate and the house. but i believe it represents better health care policy than either of the original bills. this was  an easy conference. my colleague from maine. senator mitchell. and i spent many hours with the house conferees on medicare and medicaid issues working to resolve significant differences between the two bills. i would like to commend my colleague for the tremendous job he did in representing the senate in this conference and his splended ability to arrive at a reasonable and fair compromise. many of the changes in the medicare and medicaid program included in this conference report will reduce* the deficit. but overall i believe that we were also able to balance most of the spending reductions with good health care policy. i would like to describe some of the changes which are included in this bill which will help those in need of better or more comprehensive health care services. even though we were instructed to reduce spending. we were able tin some instances to increase very important programs. especially those dealing with the poor. the bill includes numerous provisions which will address the needs of the elderly. these provisions will improve the care nursing home residents receive. the amendments will go a long way toward ensuring that elderly individuals have a good quality of life and receive high quality medical care in their twilight years. in addition. we increased the amount of money that those living in a nursing home can keep each month. we also established a national commission on long term care. we made a number of changes in the medicare home health benefit which will assist in alleviating many of the ambiguities and problems home health care providers face that is district nurses for examplein attempting to receive reimbursement from medicare for the services that they provide to the elderly. in a further effort to improve home health care services for the elderly. the conference adopted a provision i proposed to allow demonstration projects designed to improve the delivery of health care services to medicare beneficiaries outside of institutional settings. this provision will help fill the gaps in home health care for the elderly by providing a predetermined payment to community nursing organizations. this is designed to provide the services medicare beneficiaries need to fully recover from an illness. community nursing organizations will also help more medicare beneficiaries live independently longer. by providing inhome assistance to help prevent institutionalization. we also addressed the health care problems children face. and i would like to draw the senates attention to this provision. this package includes aher small step forward in improving the health care services for young children. infants and pregnant women. this continues our efforts over the last 5 years to ensure that our health care system provides access for the very poorespecially children. the provision we adopted includes expanding the medicaid program to cover pregnant women and infants who are between 100 percent and 185 percent of poverty. these families are the socalled working poor. the great gap in our medicaid program is that it stops when you reach a certain poverty level. then if you should go to work and rise above the proverty level. even though you work for a firm that provides medical coverage at all. you lose your medical coverage under medicaid. and that is an understable barrier that poor women face in deciding whether or  to take a job. why take a job if you lose the medicaid coverage  only for yourselfmaybe you can take thatbut when you lose it for your children as well. so what we are trying to do is encourage individuals on welfare to break out of these throes and become independent. but we have to help them in the initial steps. encourage them to take a job and in the meantime provide them some medical coverage for their children and themselves. this is a critical first step toward recognizing the need to create a health care system which will include those who are working. but have a limited income and are uncovered through their employment. it is also a component of a bill i introduced earlier this year called medamerica. we also attempted to address some of the problems individuals with disabilities face in the medicare program. the conference report includes a provision i advocated which will eliminate disincentives to work for those with disabilities. let us take an example. you have an individual who is qualified for ssdi and medicare. what we did was provide a permanent extended eligibility if the individual has to discontinue work for the same disability. let us take somebody with multiple sclerosis. let us say they qualify for medicare. then the multiple sclerosis goes into remission. the individual goes out to work. and then after a couple of years the ms comes back again and further afflicts them. under the current law. they can go back onto medicare for the same disability without an extended waiting period. what we did in this bill is say they can go back onto medicare without the mal waiting period and thus we encourage them to take a chance when in this instance the multiple sclerosis goes into remission. the individual will say. "i will go to work. i k i will  lose my medicare if i get sick again. i can go back immediately onto medicare. so i will take a chance. i will go to work." that is the best thing of all for the individual and for our society as a whole. for any individual. with a disability who has qualified for ssdi and medicare. it provides permanent extended eligibility if the individual has to discontinue work for reasons of the same disability. this provision is of special concern to those with disabilities such as multiple sclerosis who may be able to return to work for an extended period of time. but always face the threat that their disability could deteriorate to a point where working becomes impossible. at that point. if they are  able to get back on medicare without the mal 2year waiting period. they face emous financial and health care problems. we also made some technical changes in -medicaid to address some problems which are simply wrong under current law. for example. we adopted a provision which allows infants to be included under their mothers medicaid coverage to avoid the tragedy of an infant being refused medical treatment simply because his medicaid eligibility has  yet been processed. this is possible as the law exists  unless this conference reportis adopted. the child is refused treatment because his medical eligibility -has  yet been processed. aher example is a change we made in the law of fix a problem in the katie beckett waiver program -which was excluding eligible children from the program. this package also contains spending reductions in the medicare program. the cost of the medicare program is still increasing at an unacceptable rate. and we all rocognize that. and we. will continue to look at how the program can be changed to show these increases down. however. these changes must be based on good health care policy decisions. we made a strong effort to ensure that the final changes in the program are fair and represent good health care policy. i believe we were successful. one of the most troubling problems addressed in the conference report involves the increase in payments to hospitals. the prospective payment -system established a single rate of payment for hospitals based upon the illness to be treatedthe drg rate. when we developed that system. we knew that fine tuning would be necessary. the conference agreement addresses many of the concerns about the differences obetween urban. rural and inner city hospitals. under this agreement. innercity hospitals will receive a 1.5percent increase. urban hospitals will receive a 1percent increase and rural hospitals will receive a 3:percent increase. to reflect the concerns raised by hospitals in the midwestern and new england regions. this agreementslows down the transition to national rates for 3 years. this will mean a 0.4percent update for hospitals in these regions which have higher costs. especially energy costs. than other areas of the country. aher difficult issue addressed by the conference was physician reimbursement under the medicare program. the conference report reflects the. very strong feelings that the house conferees had regarding physician .payments.they strongly believed thatit was necessary. to retain a difference in the increase ain reimbursement between those who will accept what medicare will -pay as payment in full and those who wish to charge beneficiaries more than that amount. we agreed to retain a small differential. more importantly. we included in this package a substantially larger increase for what are called primary servicesoffice visits. emergency room visits and nursing home visits. this is an issue i feel strongly aboutthis will encourage cognitive servicesthe doctor talking with his patientrather than highly technical services. i believe the agreement we reached with the house is a -reasonable compromise and good policy. it will save the federal government money. control beneficiary outofpocket costs and allow physicians to increase their charges at a reasonable rate. we also included two demonstration projects on preventive services. the first was to provide therapeutic shoes for diabetics and the second was to provide for influenza shots. it is my hope that these two projects will show once and for all that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. this is a good agreement and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
. today i rise in opposition to the majority leaders motion for cloture in the debate over s. 79. the highrisk occupational disease ification act. i am an original cosponsor of s. 79. and i heartily support its goal of reducing the incidence of occupational disease through preventative health care. but to move a piece of legislation through this distinguished body. by cutting off debate before it has hardly begun. is objectionable to me. we are members of what has been called the greatest deliberative body in the world. the tradition of the senate. like that of our nation. is democracy. quite simply put. in this country we are  only allowed to disagree. we are allowed to spell out that disagreement. . what kind of example. what kind of precedent would we set in the senate if we stifled debate on every measure we felt was controversial. i firmly believe in the principles of s. 79. i recognize that it is controversial. many senators have deep concerns about it. i am  afraid of some healthy debate on the measure among my distinguished colleagues. i am afraid. however. about the farreaching consequences of a strategically imposed gag order that disallows debate before debate has started. whether or  the bill is a good bill is  at issue here. the ends do  justify the means. it is the right of all senators. and the right of the constituents whom they represent. to speak out and voice their opinions. i ask all of my colleagues who support s. 79 to think about this cloture vote. it is  a vote on the bill. we took a big step for civil rights in our country yesterday. lets  back up today and deny free speech to those who chose to dissent.
. i join my colleagues in urging that the chairman of the budget committee work in conference for additional funding for the medicaid program. these increased funds in addition to offsets in the medicare catastrophic loss protection act will help ensure that critical medicaid expansions which have widespread and bipartisan support in the full senate and the finance committee will be enacted this year. there are four sensible and costeffective changes in the medicaid program which must be passed this year. they are spousal impoverishment. increased coverage of lowincome children and pregnant women. medicaid buyins to medicare for the lowincome elderly and the welfare to work medicaid transition benefit. it is critical that the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution provide the necessary funding in the medicaid program to accommodate these initiatives. if we are able to enact these important provisions. we will go a long way toward ensuring that those most in need will receive necessary health care assistance.
. i have joined senator mitchell in sponsoring this legislation because i believe it is time for us to have a comprehensive. rational and fair solution to the problem of longterm care on the table to examine. it is clear that although many senior citizens support the catastrophic loss protection act we are currently working on in conference. most feel strongly that longterm care is a catastrophic expense and should be included as part of any discussion on catastrophic coverage. for most of the elderly. the risk of needing longterm care and entering a nursing home is their most paralyzing fear. they have good reason to be concerned. the lifetime risk of entering a nursing home is about 20 percent and the average cost of 1 year in a nursing home is approximately $22.000. onehalf of all nursing home payments are outofpocket expenditures by the elderly and almost all the rest are paid by the medicaid program. by default. medicaid has become our longterm care program. as it is currently structured. medicaid is clearly inadequate and the incentives it has created are perverse. approximately onehalf of all medicaid recipients in nursing homes were  initially poor. but spent their income and resources on longterm care before becoming eligible for medicaid. elderly individual or couple should be forced into poverty before assistance will be provided for longterm care for a chronic illness or debilitating condition like alzheimers disease. longterm care is  a new issue to me. it has been clear for some time that the most difficult task we all face is solving the problems faced by individuals with a chronic. debilitating illness or a severe disability which requires progressive levels of care over an extended length of time. longterm care assistance can be required by any individual. regardless of age. in fact. i am the author of legislations. 1673. the medicaid home and community quality services actto restructure our longterm care system as it applies to the disabled. i mention this legislation because i believe many of the concepts it embodies should be applied to all people of all ages and disabilities needing longterm care. these concepts are: prevention. independence. and flexibility. every individual should have the opportunity to remain at home with their family or in their own communiapril 21~. 1988 s i 1 1109 ty. our longterm care program should encourage rather than discourage this. too often we see young children with disabilities torn away from their families and placed in an institution. simply because that is the only help or relief the parents can find. the same is true with aging individuals who simply are  capable of performing one or two daily tasks necessary to live independently. through respite and home care. visiting nurse services and outpatient health care. many people would ile able to live mal and active lives much longer. we can prevent unnecessary institutionalization and encourage independence for as long as possible by allowing flexibility in the manner and range of 6ervices provided. around these concepts we can build a high quality. appropriate system of longterm care services which is carefully planned and monitored. the proposal we are introducing today is attractive because it recognizes the importance of these concepts. homebased benefits such as respite care and home health care will be available to medicare beneficiaries immediately. the respite care benefit will assist families with an impaired elderly family member by providing home or day care assistance. the home health care services will consist of those currently available under medicare with some liberalization and the addition of homemaker and chore aide services. together. these services will relieve some of the burden on unpaid family caregivers and help elderly individuals remain with their families longer. they will also go a long way toward helping elderly individuals remain independent longer. after a 2year period. 70 percent of the cost of an individuals nursing home care will be paid for by this program30 percent of the cost will be the individuals responsibility. by placing an emphasis on respite care. home health care and case management our proposal recognizes that a comprehensive longterm care eystem must encompass much more than traditional health care. however. this emphasis is  created at the expense of more intensive nursing home care. our proposal will provide financial assistance for nursing home care after a 2year exclusionary period. this will enable every individual to plan for the future because they will k in advance what their financial liability will be in the worst case scenario. because our proposal would create a defined risk. we hope it will encourage private ins arance companies to begin to offer longterm care coverage. indeed. in order for the system to be successful. private sector involvement is essential. our proposal recognizes that there is a critical role for the private sector to play. however. the system must be integrated so the care of each individual is coordinated and managed by one entitysuch as a case management system. it must be eas. to follow and understandwithout a lot of paperwork to four and five different agencies or insurance companies. as always. financing will be one of the most difficult issues to resolve. our bill calls for an increase in the medicare part b flat premium as well as an increase in the supplemental premium we will establish when the catastrophic loss protection act is passed. copayments and deductibles will be required in order to receive services. in addition. our bll would repeal the current medicare wage tax limit. finally. our bill would impose a 5percent surtax on the transfer of assets by gift or inheritance in excess of $200.000. together. these financing mechanisms would pay for all of the benefits in our proposal. however. more attractive financing mechanisms may evolve as we continue to examine the issue. this bill will give us a place to begin serious examination of the longterm care i e. my cosponsorship is a pledge work in the finance committer ith my colleague from maine on a comprehensive solution to the longterm care problems we face in this nation.e
. the federal government currently provides incentive grants for alcohol safety programs. the socalled section 408 program which includes both basic and supplemental grants has been a major success in my home state of rhode island and has made possible several worthwhile programs to combat drunk driving. the bill i am cosponsoring today with senator lautenmerg and senator danforth would complement the 408 program and authorize federal seed money to states for the establishment of additional selfsupporting drunk driving prevention programs. in order to be eligible for a grant. states would have to establish programs under which fines and surcharges collected from individuals convicted of drunk driving would be returned to communities for enforcement. in addition. the proposal requires states to provide for an expedited drivers license suspension or revocation system. this second provision is essential to deter individuals from driving while under the influence of alcohol. drunk drivers must k that they will be prosecuted and that their licenses will be revoked in timely fashion. in addition. under this legislation. states will be eligible for supplemental grants if: first. law enforcement officers are required to test for blood alcohol content whenever they have probable cause to believe that a driver involved in a collision resulting in the loss of human life or serious injury. had committed an alcoholrelated traffic offense. and second. there is established an effective system for preventing drivers under age 21 from obtaining alcoholic beverages. it is time to get tough with drunk drivers and support a uniform response to alcoholrelated accidents. the purpose of this legislation is to encourage states to adopt laws that have proven to be highly effective in reducing alcoholrelated fatalities. despite the past successes of federal and state efforts to combat drug and alcohol abuse. the fight against drunk driving on our roads and highways is far from over. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation.9 by mr. bumpers (for himself.
. i rise to enthusiastically support the conference report on h.r. 2470. the medicare catastrophic coveage act of 1988. those of us on the conference committee worked long and hard to achieve this agreement and to balance the many different interests that were represented during our deliberations. we worked closely with the administration. i would like to join in the tribute to secretary bowen. there is question that we would  be here today with this legislation crafted the way it is and acceptable to the administration without the efforts of dr. bowen. he was a tower of strength. and calm in assisting us. as the distinguished chairman of the committee mentioned. i am confident that dr. bowen had to combat a lot within administrative circles to arrive at the goals that we finally did. next i want to recognize the efforts of the chairman of our committee. the finance committee. senator bentssn. the senator from texas. he did a superlative job on this legislation. in any legislation such as this you come. down to a crunch toward the end where you have major issues that lie unresolved. senator bentsen. representing the finance comnittec. representing the conferees. netiatcd with the chairm&n of the way:. and means committee and brought us back a very. very successful piece of legislation. without his efforts and superlative work i do  think we would see anything like this bill. i want to salute senator bentsen for what he did. i also want to pay tribute to senator dole who wes deeply involved in this and gave a lot of leader.ship. and to senator mitcihell from maine who worked so closely with me and others. particularly on the prescription drug benefit with the ilouse. ile wqs extremely kledgeable. grasped the issues. and he did a very. very fine job. our efforts on the issue this began in 1986. in that year dr. bowen. as secretary of hhs. health and human services. developed a report and up with some legislative proposals. the original bill. which i was pleased to be a cosponsor of. was 1127. the catastrophic loss protection act. reported by the finance conmittee and passed by the senate last year. i was delighted to have been involved in process. it was my privilege t6 be appointed by our chairman to work on the negotiations with dr. bowen. and later with the house. along with senator durenberoer. senator baucus. senator  bentseh but also those of senators heinz. dascrle.
i am concerned that two of the "technical" amendments atided to the catastrophic bill during the conference could change the direct reimbursement fee schedule for certified registered nurse anesthetist services before that fee schedule has been fully developed by the health care financing administration and proposed for congressional and public comment. it is my hope that these technical amendments would  undermine the establishment of an equitable fee schedule under medicare part b for crnas. consistent with our previous action and intent in this area. i would hope that we can revisit the two issues raised by these technical amendments after we have had- a chance to review the proposed fee schedule.
. promoting the professional growth of nurses will encourage them to remain active in their profes. sion and will equip them to practice in an increasingly complex health care system. passage of this legislation will also let the nurses of america k that we recognize the vital role they play in our system and that we intend to do whatever we can to increase our support for their work. i urge my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this critical legislation.o by mr. symms (for mr. hei~s. for himself. mr. sanford. and mr. symms):
. today i am pleased to join my colleague from illis. senator simon. in cosponsoring senate joint resolution 350. to designate september 35. 1988 as national drive for life weekend. drunk driving is an american tragedy. too often. i pick up the newspaper and read about the suffering caused by drunk drivers: the tremendous loss of human potential. the promising lives cut short. and the families torn apart by senseless tragedy. alcohol abuse has become an increasing problem in this country. the costs of this abuse are clearly magnified on our roads. when operators of cars. trucks or buses drink and drive. they endanger  only their own lives. but the lives of passengers entrusted to their care. other motorists and even inent bystanders. drunk driving is responsible for the death of 23.000 people annually. or one person every 22 minutes. numbers alone. howevereven numbers of this magnitudedo  begin to tell the story of the suffering and loss caused by drunk driving every day. that is why we need to take effective action . mothers against drunk driving [maddi. a group born out of personal experience. is an extraordinary example of what ordinary citizens can do if they care to act. in the last several years. madd has been one of the most important and effective forces in the twin fights to raise consciousness about drunk driving and to reduce the number of alcoholrelated accidents on our streets and highways. drunk driving affects individuals from all age groups and ecoic backgrounds. that is why i joined with my colleague. senator pell and 97 other senators in urging surgeon general c. everett koop to declare drunk driving a "national crisis." it is time to bring every federal effort possible to bear on the problem of drunk driving. as one step toward the eradication of this hazard. i urge all americans to observe drive for life day on september 3. 1988 by  drinking and driving. and to support the monthlong drive for life campaign sponsored by mothers against drunk driving. beyond that. each one of us should make a personal effort to prevent our friends and relatives from needlessly endangering their own lives and those of others by drinking and driving. concerned citizens can make a difference.*
. i strongly support the legislation we are  considering. the medical waste tracking act of 1988. this bill. which has been mentioned. is the result of the work of senator lautenderg. senator bradley. senator moynihan. senator damato. senator weicker. myself. and others. i particularly want to point out it will direct the epa to implement a tracking system which will trace the medical waste in new york. new jersey. and connecticut we might say from "cradle to grave". in other words. from where this waste originates in medical centers. clinics. hospitals. wherever it might be. straight on through until it is properly disposed of. this measure will impose criminal penalties on those convicted of improper disposal of medical waste. anyone implicated in polluting our oceans with hypodermic needles or vials of infectious materials "or other medical wastes should  just be slapped with a stiff fine. they ought to be sent to jail. and that is what happens under this legislation. they endanger public health and they should be treated like the criminals they are. i have worked with senator iauten13erg on this bill to make sure that epa is focusing on this waste which is being transported currently through the tides and the currents up onto our new england beaches. the incidence of hospital waste on new england beaches makes it clear that this is  just a restricted problem affecting unfortunately as it is the long island beaches and the new jersey beaches. but it is affecting the entire east coast. this legislation will require epa to conduct monitoring of the beaches of new york. new jersey. and all of new england. in recent days. in my home state of rhode island. over 100 pieces of medlcal waste have been found up on our shores. some amount of infectious waste has been found on nearly every single beach in our state. fortunately. the amounts of it have  been sufficient to require the closing of the beaches as. unfortunately. has occurred in new york. but it could well happen. and we want to prevent that from occurring and we want to make sure that it does  happen as it has in new york and new jersey. i stress the points that senator weicker made. there is a limit to what our oceans can take. and clearly we have reached that limit. the oceans can be a receptacle for societys waste ad infiniltum. we have reached the point. we have to stop and  only with medical waste but with the dumping of sludge at the 106 mile site off new york shores. a matter that we will be taking up later on.
. the approved search for help should  be restricted to those who write to "dear abby." as a nation it is right that we spend millions of federal dollars on assisting mental health services. medicaid pays. for such help. and just this year. we increased the allowance for those services under medicare. how selfdefeating it would be to say that those who avail themselves of such assistance must thereafter by considered under a dark cloud. we recognize there are certain restrictions on attaining the presidencyone must be over 35 years of age and be a u.s. citizen. let us  add to these the sworn pledge that the candidate has never have had counseling. that is  good for our nation. i want to thank the chair. i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. i want to congratulate our distinguished colleague from connecticut on this amendment. what he has done is to add medical waste as one of these wastes which are prohibited under the ocean dumping act with the penalties that go thereto. for instance. we already have under the clean water act. and likewise he is amending that. we already recognize. for instance. radioactive waste as a specific waste that is prohibited. or chemical warfare waste. what the distinguished senator from connecticut has done is to add to this medical wastes. that is a good approach. because thus we pick up the existing penalties and he has strengthened those that exist under the two acts that i mentioned. the ocean dumping and the clean water acts. so. along with my distinguished colleague from new jersey. i want to congratulate him and say this is a good amendment and on this side we accept it.
. i would  be a support. of it. but the bad news is. we desparately need a federal leave policy because parental leave is  common. and its scarcity is hurting americans everywhere. the irony is. those the most hurt are the ones we want to help the mostthose americans who are working and raising families. there is some good news. though. the good news is. the cost of parental leave is minimal. as originally written. this bill exempted employers who had less than 20 employees. mind you. that was the way the original bill was written.  the exemption applies to those employers with less than 50 employes. before this amendment the bills cost was assessed by the general accounting office at $200 million a year.  that the exemption for businesses applies to those employers with less than 50 employees. the cost of this bill is estimated at $160 million. that means this bill costs about a penny a day per covered employee. this is a pittance when compared to the benefits that can be reaped for american families. in addition to its modest cost. this parental leave legislation contains a number of safeguards to ensure that employers can continue to run their businesses efficiently. first. an employer may require medical certification of a childs or a workers illness. if they think the employee is  telling the truth. then there is a requirement in the legislation for the employee to produce medical certification. an employer may require medical certification of the childs or a workers illness and may require a second opinion or periodic recertification. second. the employee must provide reasonable ice of parental or medical leave. if they are going in the hospital for an operation. they can give the employer ice so the employer can make the arrangements. also. if they are expecting a child. obviously. they can tell their employer when they plan to leave and how long they expect to be gone. this should help the employer accommodate his schedule. third. an employee may only take intermittentthat is. spaced outleave with the permission of his or her employer. the employee can say to the employer. "i think ill take a week here and a week there."   arrangements must be made to accomodate the employer to tile greatest extent possible. finally. an employer may substitute any of the employees accrued paid leave for any part of the unpaid leave provided for in this legislation. what do we mean by that. let us say the employee is ertitled to 3 weeks vacation every year. if the employee requires this sick leave of 10 weeks. 3 of those weeks must count toward the vacation time. you can track the vacation time on top of 10 weeks of leave. we do  want to penalize the good employer who does give paid vacations or leave. so. in the event any of these leaves are taken. the accrued vacation or whatever leave time is there has to be used up as part of that leave policy. parental leave will give american families a fair shake. in my judgment. children will heal faster. king their parents are there. and parents can celebrate the miracle of birth without worrying about losing their jobs. for a penny a day per covered employee. this is a leave policy that makes sense.
. i am pleased to rise in support of this bill. the medical waste tracking act of 1988. on august 3. 1 had the pleasure of managing. with my good friend from new jersey. senator lautenberg. the senate version of this bill. s. 2680. our bill received the support of the entire senate and today we are considering the housepassed measure. this bill directs epa to implement a tracking system which will trace the path of medical waste in new york. new jersey. connecticut. and the great lakes states from "cradle to grave". this system will create a paper trail from waste producer to disposal site. as passed by the house. all of these states would have been allowed to "opt out" of the demonstration prograin without having to make even a minimal showing that they have an adequate substitute in its place. the senate bill mandated the inclusion of the three atlantic coast states. new york. new jersey and connecticut. ifs ands or buts. to resolve this difference. senator baucus and i have an amendment that allows the great lakes states to opt out as in the house bill but would require the atlantic coast states to convince the administrator of epa that they have a program less stringent than the federal demonstration program before they can be excused from the demonstration program. this amendment accommodates the concern of the senate and those of us from the east coast whose beaches were littered with medical waste this past summer while. at the same time. respecting the position of the house and members from the great lakes states who have  had the opportunity to explore this matter fully with their home states and need to preserve the option for them to opt out. one measure of stringency that epa must consider when reviewing opt out ices from atlantic coast states is the small quantity generator issue. obviously. since the federal program does  include a small quantity generator exemption but merely authorizes the administrator to create one tha does  exceed 50 pounds per month. any state program that excludes generators of more than 50 pounds per month can  quaify for the opt out. there are many more measures that must be considered but the small quantity generator issue is the first and the easiest one on which to base a decision. if you can pass that threshold. test. you are out of luck. in addition to the tracking program. this measure will impose criminal penalties on those convicted of improper disposal of medical waste. anyone implicated in polluting our oceans with hypodermic needles. vials of infectious material and other medical wastes shou.d  just be slapped with a stiff fine. but should spend years behind bars. these actions endanger public health. and those convicted ought to be treated like the criminals they are. this past summer. over 100 pieces of medical waste were found washed up on rhode island beaches. some amount of infectious waste hs been found on nearly every beach in our state. fortunately. the amount and types of medical waste washing up on new england beaches was  sufficient to require the closing of new england beachesat least  this year. in new york. however. it was a different story. there several beaches had to be closed down because it was deemed unsafe for beachgoers to risk coming in contact with infectious waste. we must  allow this same fact to befall new england beaches. we can continue to use the ocean as a receptacle for all of societys waste. we must make the tough decisions necessary to insure that medical waste will  continue to mar our beaches.
. the conference agreement on the ocean dumping ban act of 1988. s. 2030. which we have just given final approval to. represents a major step in our continuing efforts to  only protect. but restore our marine environment. as a coauthor of this legislation. along with my distinguished colleague from new jersey. senator lautenbero. the senator from delaware. senator roth. senators moynihan. mitchell and others. i can tell you this conference report is a significant accomplishment. it sends a clear signal that we will longer tolerate the spoiling of our near coastal waters. this act establishes for once and for all that we can use the ocean as a receptacle for societys waste. and especially as the dumping ground for our sewage sludge. it will make it illegal to dump sludge in the ocean after this legislation will prohibit those municipalities currently dumping sewage sludge at the 106 mile disposal site from doing so within 9 months of the bills enactment. unless they enter into a compliance agreement with the environmental protection agency. dumpers will be required to pay $100200 for each ton dumped before the 1991 deadline. this money must be used by the municipalities to develop viable alternatives to sludge dumping. after 1991. any municipalities continuing to dump will be fined $600 per ton plus a 10percent annual increaseuntil the violators stop. if dumping municipal sludge in the ocean were the only or the best alternative. then fine. but epa has said unequivocally that the states utilizing the 106 mile dumpsite have  fully explored other options. this legislation requires them to develop these options. a percentage of the money from the fines will go into a trust fund. which may only be usedwith epa approvalto implement alternatives to dumping. the remaining funds go to the epa to cover the costs of administering the program. or to the states for specific activities. the act requires the epa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration [a] to establish a monitoring program to measure the effects of continued dumping on fisheries from th carolina to georges bank. they will monitor short dumping of sludge. as well. encouraging states to find beneficial uses for sludge. finally. the bill includes provisions to regulate garbage operations and to make it illegal to dispose of medical waste in the ocean. the presence of medical waste on our beaches is egh evidence to prove the need for dumping regulations. it is unfortunate that it takes a situation like we have today with medical waste washing up on our beaches. to capture the attention of the american public and of congress. but perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. since it has resulted in our action today to put a halt to the ocean dumping of sludge. we have already passed the medical waste tracking act of 1988. finally we have gotten the message that we must make the tough decisions necessary to protect our marine environmient. i thank my colleagues for joining with me in support of this muchneeded legislation.
.  i k how the distinguished majority leader became the majority leader. in commending bailey guard. he also lauded three individuals at the same time. that is pretty good. and who can argue with the appraisal that he gave. so we send bailey guard on with the very best wishes for good health and happiness in the future.
. i am pleased today to join senators simon. durenberger. and kassebaum in introducing a resolution expressing the sense of tie senate that part a of the medicare program should  be subjected to additional budget reductions in 1990. i have joined in this effort because i believe it would give us the opportunity to look at health care differently. like education. good health care is an investment in our most critical national resource: people. it is time that we gave health care the same high priority in the budget that we give it in our rhetoric. over the past 5 years the medicare program has borne the brunt of congress efforts to reduce the federal deficit. in just 6 years time. this program has contributed more than $30 billion toward savings to reduce the deficit. each year. on a bipartisan basis. the finance committee. which has jurisdiction over this program. has restricted the funds for reimbursement of hospitals. physicians. and other health care providers. however. at the same time concern about the quality of care provided by these individuals and institutions has increased. we can only do so much so fast without sacrificing the quality of care jan uary 31. 1989 con provided and medicare beneficiaries access to that care. assumptions that medicare cuts will  affect benefictaries are highly questionable. if we continue to decrease medicare reimbursement. quality and access will be adversely affected. these cuts will have an impact on medicare beneficiaries. a moratorium on medicare part a changes for one year will give us time to take a look at the results of our actions over the past 5 years and will give us the chance to explore future changes in the program. the cost of the medicare program is still increasing at an unacceptable rate and we must continue to look at how the program can be changed to slow these increases down. changes may have to be made in the medicare system to ensure the longterm stability of the medicare trust fund. however. these changes must be based on good health care policy decisions. rather than budget decisions. it may be that the congress as a whole will  agree to this resolution. in that event. changes may have to be made in the program to achieve necessary savings. if that is the result. i will certainly do my best to ensure that our decisions are sound. as the finance committee considers any changes to the medicare program. my goal will be to ensure that the medicare program continues to provide quality health care at a reasonable cost to beneficiaries while adequately reimbursing providers. i urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.
. i commend senator bradley for his continued efforts in this critical area of infant mortality and child health. our successful work in the past to improve access to health care for mothers and children leaves me encouraged about the prospects for this legislation. i hope my colleagues agree that federal dollars for this legislation would be well spent and that even during a time of fiscal restraint it is sound ecoic policy to invest in the health of mothers and children. by mr. pell:
 bush and epa administrator reilly are deeply interested in the cfc problem and i urge them to endorse my proposal. the united states should take a leading role in pressing for elimination of these chemicals by later than 1997. informal negotiations will begin this sunday in london at a meeting called by prime minister thatcher. formal talks will get under way with the first meeting of the parties to the montreal protocol that will be held in helsinki during the latter half of april. nevertheless. if the negotiations bog down. we will  sit around and wait. as a major consumer of cfcs we can use our clout as a trading partner. if we are forced to move first. it will have a secondary beneficial effect: our industry can get the jump on alternatives and be more competitive in the future. my proposal to eliminate the most harmful cfcs. halons and methyl chloroform. by 1997 may strike some as a tough pill to swallow. i recognize the enforcement difficulties. such as identifying and prosecuting those who release cfcs into the atmosphere or ascertaining whether foreign electronics manfacturers have used cfc solvents. but these problems can be overcome. true. this bill is strong medicine but i worry that it is  strong egh. we have a very sick patient. a patient who is suffering from a disease that continues to advance like a cancer. with each new study. the scientists discover a new surprise. they are finding that the disease is much more advanced than anyone thought. it seems that every time we get a piece of good news about the ozone layer. it is followed by a matter of weeks with more bad news. for example. on september 26. 1987. 24 nations signed the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. that was a major achievement and gave us reason to cheer. but within 2 weeks we had a new report from antarctica confirming our worst fears. the "hole" over the antarctic was worse than we thought and manmade chemicals such as cfcs were identified as "the smoking gun."
. this legislation is long overdue. americans need to k how to insure that the quality of the air inside their home is healthy. this bill takes a giant step toward addressing the health threat posed by contaminants of the air indoors. i urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this.
. this package has the full support of the american heart association. the american cancer society. and the american lung associationthree groups which have dedicated themselves to improving the collective health of all americans. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a factsheet appear in the record at this point.
. i rise today to recognize one of the rhode islands foremost profit corporations. blue cross and blue shield of rhode island. this year rhode island blue cross and blue shield celebrates its 50th anniversary of providing health care coverage to the citizens of our state. to mark this anniversary the employees of blue cross and blue shield plan on sponsoring a series of civic and charitable activities throughout the state. blue cross and blue shield of rhode island opened its doors on september 1. 1939. just days before the outbreak of world war ii. the rhode island legislature and goy. william h. vanderbilt led the way for the incorporation of the hospital service corp.-later kn as blue cross. its goal was to provide comprehensive protection against the costs of health care to the largest number of people at the lowest possible cost. like other blue cross plans sprouting up across the country. blue cross of rhode island protected people and their families against financial ruin resulting from the cost of a serious illness or injury. from its inception. this new health coverage concept was well received by the public. by 1942. membership had reached 100.000. today. more than threequarters of all rhode islanders are covered by blue cross and blue shield of rhode island. blue cross and blue shield of rhode island has progressed dramatically from its first days in the old rhode island hospital trust building. in providences financial district. it has grown from a corporation of 8 people to one of the states major employers. with 1.800 employees. as the job of providing health care coverage has grown. so have the responsibilities of blue cross and blue shield. by 1966. blue cross was responsible for administering the federal medicare program and the newly created plan 65 program. it is my ho to call attention to the fine tradition of service the employees of blue cross and blue shield have provided to the people of rhode island over the past 50 years. i join with all rhode islanders in congratulating blue cross and blue shield of rhode island on its 50th anniversary. thank you for your efforts of the past 50 years. and best wishes for even greater accomplishments in the years ahead.*
. the work of the world health organization does  directly benefit many of its members states. thus many countries have hing to lose by iging the u.s. threat and voting in favor of instating the plo. if those countries should call our bluff. as it were. and i certainly hope it does  occur. then we will be in the situation of shutting down our efforts to eradicate child malnutrition. to stop the global spread of adis. to prevent the needless death from common curable disease. so we are getting ourselves. i think. here in a very difficult situation. i do  think the plo should be a member of the world health organization. i think our secretary should negotiate to the fullest extent he can to prevent that and bargain and do everything we can. but if this is a vote. and i will ask the sponsor of the resolution. is his position. and i will ask the distinguished senior senator from pennsylvania. is his position. that if the plo would some way become a member of the world health organization. that means the united states withdraws our total support.
i will take 2 minutes. i just want to say i share the senator from pennsylvanias concern. i just hope we do  come to a situation where we are going to end up in any way voting against the united states supporting the world health organization. i hope that secretary baker can work this out. cognizant of the problems on the other side. this is  an easy resolution. and i want to draw that to the attention of the body.
. i am pleased to join in introducing the americans with disabilities act. of 1989. what better way could there be to mark the 25th year of the civil rights act than for congress to write into federal law these fundamental and long overdue protections. the 1964 civil rights act was a landmark act in this nations civil rights history. but for too long. it has been an unfinished landmark. because its provisions do  afford protection to the 36 million americans who are disabled. the americans with disabilities act would address this longstanding gap by extending the relevant protections of the 1964 civil rights act to those with disabilities. it is an initiative designed to ensure that the american dream does  stop at the doorsteps of people with disabilities. this proposal stands for the proposition that individual should be denied the opportunity to participate fully in our society. it stands for the proposition that our society should support independence rather than dependence among the disabled. the americans with disabilities act is also a logical partner to aher piece of legislation many of us have sponsoredthe medicaid home and community quality services act. s. 384. s. 384 would change federal programs to reflect the same philosophies we are endorsing today: opportunity. independence. and full participation in society. it is time for both the public and private sectors to help. rather than hinder. those with disabilities in their attempt to achieve their fullest potential. together. our efforts can ensure a future in which all of our citizens. regardless of their disability. will thrive.
. i represent a state whose citizens are very protective and concerned about the quality of their environment. they do  want our waters full of plastic pollution.  our coastline fouled with medical waste. they have supported measures to preserve open space and sought funds to clean up narragansett bay. this is the public awareness and support for environmental issues i hope the bill we are introducing today will help foster in every state throughout the country. i hope my colleagues will join senators burdick. mitchell. and myself in giving their full support for this legislation. by mr. ford (for himself and mr. mccain):
. in the bill which was drafted in our committee. the finance committee. and which was approved by the full senate here. however. when we went to conference with the house. the provisions making the program voluntary were dropped. had to be dropped at the insistence of the house. the bill we are intoducing today would. quite simply. reinstate the voluntary nature of the program by typing catastrophic coverage to part b coverage. this would mean that any medicare beneficiary could opt out of part b. and thus out of catastrophic. those who choose this option. as i mentioned earlier. would  pay either the part b premium. the flat catastrophic premium. or the supplemental catastrophic premium. this would give each beneficiary the opportunity to examine the benefits and the costs. and make an informed decision. personally. i would opt in if i were in that situation. because i believe you can get better coverage for the price in the private market. the value of medicare benefits as a wholeparts a. b. and catastrophicis still significantly higher than the premium. even for those who will pay the maximum catastrophic premium. i believe. in this program i helped write it 2 years ago. representing the senate finance committee. along with the distinguished senator from maine. our leader. i believe that it is a good pruiram for the citizens of the country to take advantage of. however. some do  want it. some who perhaps might have coverage through a very extensive program that continues into retirement from their. business career or perhaps those who are part of a government program or a military retiree. they may find it is better to opt out and we ought to give them that opportunity. that is what this legislation does. cbo has done a report that bears this out. showing that the government subsidy on medicare benefits is substantial across all income categoriesincluding those who will pay the maximum supplemental premium. what this all means is that medicare. as expanded by the new catastrophic coverage is a good deala good package of benefits at a belowmarket price. but as firmly as i believe that. i also believe that senior citizens ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. after reviewing the benefits. the costs. and any other plans they may have. for example. our legislation would allow a medicare beneficiary with a very generous retiree health benefit planwhether from a private employer. the federal government. or other retiree health planto opt out of both part b and catastrophic. some such plans provide extensive health care benefits under very generous termssometimes even free of charge. under our bill. a person with such a plan could opt out and thus avoid duplication of benefits. this. we believe. is the best way to satisfy the concerns we have heard from those who have these very generous plans. in summary. making the program voluntary is a reasonable way to resolve most. if  all. of the concerns surrounding the new catastrophic law. under our bill. seniors who want the benefits could get them. and those who do  could opt out. by opting out of part b. it is as simple as that. and i hope my colleagues will give this proposal their favorable consideration.
. i am proud to be joining senator bentsen in sponsoring the maternal and child health act of 1989. legislation to expand access to health care for millions of lowincome children and pregnant women. making an investment in our childrens health is the most important investment we can make as parents and as a nation. yet. despite good intentions. our efforts have fallen short. there are 12 million children who have little or access to health care. their future and the future of this nation is at stake unless we move to correct this problem . we have been making incremental steps toward correcting this problem over the past few years despite fiscal restraints. we have made a differenceunfortunately. it is a small difference in comparison with what we must accomplish. we must ensure that all lowincome pregnant women. infants. and children have access to quality and affordable health care. children deserve to be born healthy and get a good start in life. lowincome pregnant women must have access to prenatal care regardless of their income. without that care. their babies may be born with serious physical and mental impairments. there are several reasons why health care is unavailable to millions of children. first. our health care system has changed dramatically over the past 20 years. the hometown family physician who provides affordable primary and preventive care doesnt exist for many american families anymore. health care costs have june 1.9. 1989 risen dramatically. making it extreme. ly difficult for providers to deliver.affordable care to lowincome families. public and private efforts to protect families from catastrophic illnesses has contributed to the evolution of a sick care system instead of a health care system. this means that primary and preventive care are longer emphasized as they should be. particularly for growing children. second. many state medicaid programs reimburse health care providers below their actual cost of providing care. therefore. more and more providers of care are turning away from serving medicaid beneficiaries. third. malpractice premiums. particularly for obstetricians and gynecologists. are increasing at alarming rates. the malpractice problem has led to the practice of defensive medicine which has led providers to perform costly and often unnecessary procedures. this in turn results in inefficient use of precious health care resources. fourth. and most importantly. the existing medicaid program only covers a portion of children who are poor. and does even less for the nearpoor. it is  necessary to have an income below the federal poverty level to be unable to afford health insurance. about half of the 12 million uninsured children are in families with incomes above the federal poverty level. that is a large part of what our legislation seeks to remedy. although we cant solve all the problems of access to health care for children without structural changes to the system. we can make a very large step by enacting this legislation. our bill would expand medicaid eligibility to cover these poor and nearpoor children. states would be required to provide care to. pregnant women. infants and children under age 6 with incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty level. this requirement would be phased in over 2 years. in addition. states would be given the option to cover children under age 18 who are below poverty. this legislation also addresses the problems of asset tests for the purposes of determining eligibility for pregnant women and children. immediate coverage of pregnant women is critical in preventing lowweight births. therefore our bill would extend presumptive medicaid eligibility to all pregnant women and streamline the process for states by delaying documentation requirements. the bill also excludes the value of necessities such as personal effects. household goods. and burial plots from the asset test for pregnant women. eligibility determinations would be made on a onetime basis for pregnant women and their newborn children until the child is 2 months old and every 6 months for children under age 6 who are eligible for medicaid but  cash assistance. the maternal and child health act of 1989 also creates medicaid buyin demonstration projects to extend health care coverage to low income uninsured children and to "medially uninsurable children" ineligible for medicaid. these demonstration projects incorporate the principles established in legislation called medamerica which i introduced in the last congress. medamerica would cover all individuals below 100 percent of poverty and allow people between 100 and 200 percent of poverty to purchase health care coverage on a sliding scale basis. in addition. the bill would allow those individuals who had exhausted their private insurance or who because of a preexisting condition were unable to purchase insurance to buy medicaid coverage at a reasonable rate. by demonstrating these principles in four projects in the united states. we will be able to determine the effectiveness and affordability of expanding the medicaid program to those who have other way to obtain health care. the bill also seeks to promote medicaid participation by health care providers. the current barriers for health care providers are addressed in the legislation by a number of technical provisions. both the early and periodic screening. diagis. and treatment benefit (epsdt] under medicaid and the maternal and child health block grant would be improved by our legislation. medicaid would cover any medically necessary service identified as necessary through the epsdt program. the mch block grants authorization level would be increased by $150 million. a portion of these funds must be used for children with special health care needs. there are too many provisions that will significantly increase care for uninsured children to list. however. i urge my colleagues to take a good hard look at this legislation and see how much we can accomplish for the amount of money spent. this medicaid expansion would cover nearly 2.5 million children by 1991. making it a wise and cost efficient use of funds. it is  only a good investmentit is what our children need and deserve. i commend the chairman of the finance and committee for his efforts to increase access to health care for our children. i am proud to join him in sponsoring this bill and hope that my colleagues in the finance committee and in the senate will do the same.e
yes. i want the principal sponsor of the legislation to realize that i am  very happy about that child health care provision because. as he mentioned. in coming up with this legislation he had to accept some things that perhaps lie would  have. had lie had the choice. but that healthcare provision seems to me to be unfortunate. everybody is for health care for children. there is problem over that. the problem is that if you are spending $1.5 billion. but are only taking care of those people who are already receiving the health insurance. you are  making any progress. it makes even less sense when we realize we have other vehicles out there. such as medicaid. extension of the medicaid program. which we have all worked on. would provide far greater coverage for far more children. in direct contrast. this proposal targets individuals who are currently covered. that is one of my great difficulties with this provision. i want to thank the distinguished senator from connecticut who has put so much time in this. and has given excellent leadership. . i suggest the absence of a quorum.
could i draw an analogy to the medicaid situation. in that you have a provider here who has a host of private. you might say. eligible children attending there. private patients. if you would. and so the state is going to pay for several poor children to attend that facility. if i understand this provision. it says the state must be prepared to pay what the going rate is at that facility. for example. and if they set a lower rate. the facility is going to say. "we dont want that child."
is this  a repeat of the medicaid situation. where we have doctors. for example. who have plenty of patients and do  want to take the medicaid patient because medicaid is  paying an adequate amount of money.
s message of a "kinder and gentler nation." he is widely kn by his family. friends. neighbors. and the community at large as a uniquely caring. sharing. and loving person. he is often affectionately accused of giving the shirt off his back. with great pride and personal admiration. i ask my colleagues to join me in extending our very best wishes for continued health and happiness to j.b. floyd on the occasion of his 80th birthday.e
. i am proud to join senator dole and senator riegle in sponsoring the social security work incentives act of 1989. this legislation takes a critical step toward ending the discentives built into the social security disability insurance program (ssdi] that discourage recipients from gaining financial independence. over the past few decades we have made great strides toward helping people with disabilities achieve their fullest potential as members of our communities. we enacted the education of the handicapped act in 1975 to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive an appropriate education to enable them to become productive members of the community. in 1981. we enacted the medicaid 2176 waiver allowing state medicaid programs to make community care available to individuals wishing to remain at home. in the neighborhood or other community settings. we are  close to reforming the medicaid program to create a system of services that will provide individuals with physical and mental impairments with assistance they need to remain in their own communities. and participate fully in society. in addition. the senate will soon consider the americans with disabilities act. legislation to prevent discrimination on the basis of a disability in order to further enhance fully community integration. all these efforts are aimed at recognizing the talents of those with disabilities. and the contribution that they are capable of making. however. we have left one very important stone unturned. we have neglected to change a provision of law that works against everything we are striving to accomplish. we continue to allow the social security disability insurance program to penalize those persons with disabilities who are working toward financial independence.
. we all appreciate the tremendous effort of the senator from arizona. i k he has worked long and hard on it. i commend him for his efforts. although i do disagree with his conclusions. we face an amendmentforget the point of orderwhich fundamentally alters the benefits under the catastrophic law which we worked so hard to pass. who is to say that the distinguished senator from arizona has picked the best benefits to keep or whether in fact his new proposal is the proper one to have. i make this point. i review my mail. as i think do most of the other senators. nearly everybody who writes thinks they are going to be paying the maximum of the $800 supplemental premium. this is  the case. only 6 percent of the taxpayers of the country. of the 31 million medicare beneficiaries. will be paying the maximum premium.
. i am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important and long overdue piece of legislation. we have  gone 16 years without a fundamental change in the way foods are labeled. it has become increasingly clear that the current labeling structure has been entirely overtaken by events. in that time we have made a quantum leap in the state of kledge about the relationship between diet and diseaseas well as in our interest in using this kledge in our diets. to great degree. americans are  converts to the cause of good nutrition. but just as good health depends on good nutrition. good nutrition depends on good information. more than ever before. people k that they should eat a variety of foods and avoid saturated fat. sugar and sodium. the problem comes when we try to apply those principles in our daily lives. we are bombarded with information which runs the gamut from accurate to useless to downright misleading. we try to read labels. but find the information we need isnt there. we hear makers of every type of food that exists making fantastic claims about what will happen to you if you use their product. we try to sort it all out and find that the terms that are being tossed around havent even been defined by anybody. and could mean almost anything. this is because the rules of the nutrition information game arent clear. and this is what we have to fix. because the rules arent clear. the average consumer trying to eat a good diet is really at sea without a compass. and unless the rules are clear and welldefined. they can also be used to mislead consumers or bury negative information. as is too often the case . the nutrition labeling and education act of 1989 would begin to straighten out this chaos. it would do the following things: it would make nutrition labeling mandatory. currently. nutrition labeling is voluntary for many foods and consequently nutrition labels appear on only about half of all processed foods. it would improve nutrition labels by requiring disclosure certain essential pieces of information: amount of fiber. amount of fat. type of fatsaturated or unsaturatedand amount of cholesterol. this information is the most crucial and basic dietary information. and incredibly. it is  currently required to appear. it would begin the process of improving the format of nutrition labels to make them easier to read and understand. by soliciting the recommendations of the national academy of sciences. current labels just present the information with context whatsoever. the label says 21 grams of fat or 900 milligrams of sodium. the average consumer just doesnt k: is that a little or a lot. this is the type of problem that an improved label format would help address. and finally. the bill would provide for clear and definite standards governing the claims and statements that can be made about foods. for example. terms like lite need to be defined. under current standards lite can mean anything from lowcalorie to low sodium to just lighter in texture or color. again. the average consumer just doesnt k. aher example is term cholesterolfree. under current regulations. this can be used on foods that are high in saturated fat and which raise blood cholesterol levels. the consumer trying to watch cholesterol could see the word cholesterolfree and easily assume it was a safe food.  so. current food labels are potential mineflelds of misinformation. it shouldnt be that way. you shouldnt have to have a degree in nutrition science to be able to decipher a food label and decide whether some critical piece of information has been glossed over. misrepresented. or just plain left out. you ought to be able to look at a food label. and take the information presented there at face value. that is our objective: clear. accurate and straightforward information. i hope that all of uscongress. the administration. industry and consumer groupscan work together toward this objective. i anticipate that there will be other ideas from other quarters over how best to proceed on labeling reform. and hope that this bill will spark the kind of serious discussion and debate that we need on this very important issue.* by mr. dodd (for himself. mr.
. i am pleased to be a cosponsor of the veterans agent orange exposure and vietnam service benefits act of 1989. and am pleased that the senate has taken up this important matter before the august recess. the bill is based on the agent orange compromise reached last year. which i also cosponsored. and which the senate approved. it addresses a sad line and lingering problem which has invaded the lives of many vietnam vets. and which simply can wait any longer for a solution. in good conscience. i believe the senate should approve this bill. i have met with a number of vietnam veterans and their families in rhode island who have personal experience with the devastating effects of agent orange exposure. the testimony of mr. craig close. veterans contact representative and agent orange program coordinator for the rhode island vietnam era veterans association. is especially compelling. i will ask unanimous consent that a statement by mr. close be printed in the record so that other senators may have the benefit of his firsthand account of the agony of agent orangerelated health effects. secretary of veterans affairs derwinski has already shown himself to be sympathetic on the agent orange issue. he has annced that the administration does  intend to appeal a recent court ruling against the veterans administrations overly restrictive regulations on agent orange compensation. i applaud the secretarys sensitivity to this issue of utmost importance to veterans. and look forward to working with him on implementing both the new agent orange compensation regulations and this legislation. s. 1153 does for vietnam veterans what the veterans radiation exposure disability and death benefits act. which was enacted last year. did for veterans of world war ii and the u.s. atomic testing program. it would provide disability compensation to veterans with certain illnesses. giving them the benefit of the doubt that their disabilities are the result of agent orange exposure. it would also provide for a comprehensive compilation of all data on the health effects of agent orange exposure. it is possible that scientific unanimity on the health effects of agent orange will  be achieved for a long time. if ever. in the meantime. vietnam veterans are falling ill with means of support for themselves or their families. s. 1153 will help to put an end to the agent orange debate. and complete the homecoming process for vietnam veterans. i commend the senator from massachusetts and the senator from south dakota for the hard work they have put in on this issue over the years. they have developed a bill which i think all senators can support and that will ease a terrible burden for many veterans. i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the statement to which i referred be printed in the record.

. i am distressed by the position we are in today. this bill contains a 35percent$200 millionreduction in the management operations of the medicare program which protect the trust funds from jmproper spending. at the very time that we are struggling in the finance committee to come to grips with spiraling costs in medicare. this bill would cause significant new spending increases. these increasesas much as $1 billion next yearwould  be the result of expanding benefits. but rather would be caused by weakening the arm of the program which ensures that reimbursement policies are enforced. each year these operations return as much as $3 billion to the medicare trust funds by detecting claims that either are  medicares responsibility to pay or which exceed medicares payment limits. in addition. they support the efforts of the inspector general of hhs who is charged with preventing fraud and abuse in the medicare trust funds. i am told that reductions of this magnitude will cause the loss of nearly 2.000 audit and claims review staff around the nation. these people are trained in medicare complex payment rules. activities that gao and congress have tried to enhance and improve since the early 1980s. by cutting these activities by 35 percent. we would dismantle the frontline defense which medicare beneficiaries depend upon to guarantee that their premium dollars are spent prudently. we simply can afford to add over $1 billion in medicare spending by permitting overpayments. if anything. we should be strengthening.  dismantling. the operations that review claims before they are paid. it is easy task to find $200 million within the labor. hhs appropriations bill to fix a shortfall of this magnitude. however. i hope that for the sake of the federal budget that the appropriations committee will restore this cut in medicares operations when this bill is in conference. until then. i can only express my dismay that this bill adds unnecessarily to the fastestgrowing program in the federal budget. and sends the message that medicare is weakening rather than bolstering its cost containment operations.
this program. it seems to me. follows the title of the bill. it is a program for catastrophic health insurance. in the first part it provides for longstay hospitalization coverage and the second part provides for coverage for medical bills after a deductible has been reached. yes. it is a high deductible. but then following that high deductible the individual is covered. . that is  true in the bill of the distinguished senator from arizona. as has been previously pointed out. second. much has been made about what is called . adverse selection. namely a provision in the bill that will attract only the sick. that only the sick will come forward and take this additional premium and get that additional coverage. that just is  so. .
 of the association of state and territorial health officials (astho]. played a significant role in the development of the national health objectives act for the year 2000. his leadership and professional and personal commitment to the implementation of this legislation is a credit to both astho and the state of rhode island. the national health objectives 2000 act will  mean that all americans will be in perfect health by the year 2000. it will mean. however. that americans will be more informed. and therefore be able to prevent diseases and injuries. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation and give americans the ability to make healthy choices in their lives.e
. this amendment by the senior senator from montana has received support. although it does  go as far as the senator from idaho would wish. etheless. the senator from idaho has been extremely effective and helpful in trying to reach this compromise. as he mentioned. and as we recognize. this does  totally satisfy him. but. etheless. it is a step forward as far as he is concerned. as far as those in the agricultural communities are concerned. just a couple of words about ammonia. in high concentrations it can burn the eyes. and lung tissue. standards to protect worker health from acute exposure have been promulgated by osha. some plants emit ammonia at high egh levels to cause health effects. of the 351 chemicals covered by epas toxic emission inventory. ammonia had the largest quantity of emissions in 1987. it is emitted by sources in 30 different industrial categories. that is where ammonia is coming from. the bill that we are discussing here today lists ammonia as a hazardous air pollutant. the bill would require maximum available control techogy for any source of ammonia greater than 10 tons. however. the bill also includes a provision that allows epa to forego these maximum available control techogies for a pollutant like ammonia where control to that level of stringency is  necessary in order to protect the public health. frankly. this provision is in there to save money. the bill allows epa to use a health standard in the first phase instead of techogy. all the rest of the toxic chemicals. the 351 that we have discussed. have to go with mact [maximum available control techogy] without question. it is done. it is required. but this bill allows an exception in the case of ammonia. this amendment confirms that this procedure should be used to set the standard for ammonia. that is. do  use the techogy. the mact standards immediately. use the health standard to start with. epa is to define the threshold and set the ammonia level standard at that level. at the health level. this amendment does  list ammonia as one of the substances to be controlled. it does  change the level of regulation which would otherwise have been imposed under the bill. it just assures that epa will use this specific provision in the health standard to set the standards for ammonia. this amendment is somewhat similar to the one that we accepted on electric utility boilers during the negotiations. so i want to thank the distinguished junior senator from idaho for his work on this. again recognizing that it does  completely satisfy him. it does  satisfy everybody. in some instances it does  even satisfy totally the cosponsors. but etheless. i think we should get on with it. i appreciate his support and of course the leadership of the senior senator from montana.
. this legislation will  ensure care for all persons affected by aids. it is a beginning. however. and will enable state and local governments to provide more appropriate and effective care for those with aids. just as important. it will help these individuals live longer. more dignified lives. i urge my colleagues to recognize the necessity of providing funding for direct care of persons with aids and support this critical legislation.
first of all. there is a difference in the problem that we are wrestling with. the reason we are banning the production of the cfcs is because it is a global problem. it does  just affect us.. it affects everybody in the world. we see reason that we should take tough measures here. unilaterally moving ahead alone as a nation. and let the other nations just go their way and take advantage of any ceased production that we have in this country. so that is the cfc situation. the toxic emissions problems that affect our local population. we just do  believe that we want our citizens. whether they are in boise. or whether in providence. ri. poisoned by emissions from our plants. in the first place. this. as the senator has pointed out. in the long negotiations that we have. is very difficult to monitor. indeed. the most contentious part of the whole toxic emissions program was the monitoring and deciding what is a risk and what is  a risk. for us to attempt to monitor plants abroad in foreign countries would be an impossible task. let me also say this. if i might. i k the senator is concerned about the cost to our industry pursuant to the maximum available control techogy and subsequent control measures that might be levied on our plants. but first of all. i do  think these costs are going to be as much as the senator fears. we have done this with the clean water act. all our plants have that. they can discharge into our lakes and streams. and we believe that that has worked out  only satisfactorily. but has  imposed an undue burdenit is a burden. surebut  an undue burden that has affected the competitiveness of our industries. but i think there is a greater reward. if i might say. financially. from the control of toxic emissions than there is even from the clean water act. which i am a proponent of. the clean water act permits us to have rivers. lakes and streams that are fishable and swimmable. and it is working. to some degree. those dirty rivers and lakes and streams affect the public health. but here to the extent that the toxic air emissions do. this is a health bill. we believe there will be a payout on the other side through improved health. and thus reduced medical expenses and hospitalization expenses.
. this would wreck any international trading system that we currently have. to impose on other nations requirements that we have that we have passed in order to protect our health and the health of our workers run contrary to
 reagan came in we managed to enact some tightening. prior to that. under the laws as we passed them in the late 1970s. the government was  permitted to rebut the decision made by a local doctor from the area that the diagis was black lung. and the miner could go.  to one doctor. he could doctor shop. go wherever he wanted to find a doctor until he finally found a doctor who said: "you have black lung." and it was a rebuttable presumption. namely. that was the decision. and the government was  entitled to rebut it. well. some tightening came along in 1982 or 1983 under the reagan administration. but i will still just show the figures. in the first years. 112.000 were collecting. ten years later. 399.000 people were collecting400.000. five years later. 459.000 were collecting under it. that was before the changes were made. of course. the changes did  affect any of those who were collecting. it just dealt with prospective ones. and the program then peaked at $3 billion.  $120 million-$3 billion. it is anticipated next year it will be $1.8 billion. currently it is running around $1.5 billion. so all i can say about it is it illustrates the danger to the fiscal policies of the nation when we put in these programs in which restraint is  exercised and where there are these rebuttable presumptions as is in the very amendment we are on . because we discussed that last evening. . i would be very curious where this statistic has popped up that only 3 percent of those who apply for the benefits are currently receiving them. and i would be glad to review any material the distinguished senator from illis has on this. it would come as a surprise. i must say.
well. . as i say. what is done is done. but it is just something i personally have been involved with. -i was a freshman senator. i went on the committee. at that time the senator from new jersey was chairman of that committee. senator williams. and along comes legislation *to change the black lung program. ody appeared from the administration. that drove home to me the importance of having somebody from the administration appear and be called on to testify. we just heard these horror stories from those who sought the expansion of the program. hing from those who administered it. and it whipped right through the committee and came to the floor. i became interested in it and delved into the facts and was horrified it took place. i spoke against what took place then and what was provided in the legislation. i spoke against it on the floor. we had some votes. and we were overwhelmed. and the program then went on the rampage in which it was practically impossible to disqualify an applicant who sought the benefits. it was absolutely true. the government was forbidden from reviewing the records that came from the mine fields. from the doctors there. as i mentioned before there was this doctor shopping and in would come the reading of the xrays and the diagis that it was black lung and that was it. and the benefits were paid. subsequently. as i mentioned. there was .some tightening. but the program started out with a high estimate. this is a high estimate. $380 million. this is what the program was going to cost. $380 million a year. within 10 years. it was costing $1.3 billion and then went up to $3 billion. so beware of these programs that do  have restraints. i thank the senator.
so the idea that this legislation is going to have everybody out in the street is sense. i think it is so important to put  only the correct figures in therethese are estimateswell. actually. that estimate was made by the administration on the original committee bill. and the administration did  like the committee bill. therefore. they certainly were  shaving those estimates on the low side. that was the high side estimate. clearly. or they would  have given it to us. because they were opposed to the legislation. i thank the senator for the contribution he is making to all of us and the statistics regarding the prospective deaths and the costs associated and stressing thatthis is a health bill.
. on wednesday. secretary of health and human services sullivan revealed a comprehensive new initiative by the food and drug administration to reform our food labeling systemif what we  have can be called a system. food labeling reform is an issue in which i have long been active. and i am delighted with his action. it certainly is timely. today. we are bombarded left and right with fantastic claims about the miraculous properties of foods. cholesterolfree. low calorie. lite. high fiber. naturalthese terms are used so often that consumer ks what they mean. or if they have anything to do with good nutrition. why does this happen. it is because the rules of the nutrition information game just are  clear. anyone trying to maintain a healthy diet is lost in a sea of uninformative or downright misleading labeling. it is a shame. because good health depends on good nutrition. and today people are ready to learn more about eating right. last july. i joined with senator metzenbaum in introducing s. 1425. the nutrition labeling and education act of 1989. this legislation would make nutrition labeling mandatory.  voluntary. it would improve labeling by making labels easier to read and understand. and also by requiring disclosure of a foods amount of cholesterol. fiber. and fats. furthermore. the measure would provide for clear. definite standards for the termslike "lite" and "natural"-used in claims made about foods. secretary sullivan yesterday proposed to do just that. and i applaud his actions. i intend to work closely with him and with my colleagues in the senate to develop a comprehensive new system. after all. you are what you eat.e
i just want to say i have since spoken to senator dole and i think tomorrow he will indicate that he longer wishes to be a cosponsor of this. i will leave that for him. but i just wanted to make that point here . second. i would like to say this amendment is being offered by two very thoughtful. intelligent senators who have made a great many contributions in the deliberations on the floor of this senate. and. therefore. it is with some reluctance that i have to oppose it. why. because the amendment they have presented is far too broad to accomplish the purpose that they have set out to accomplish. we have been working diligently with the staff of the distinguished senator from minnesota to revise the amendment so it could protect the interests of small sources in a way that does  destroy the fundamental efforts that we are attempting to achieve under this clean air legislation. but so far. unfortunately. we have been unable to agree on mutually acceptable language. let me briefly point out some of the factors that are involved in this amendment. first. they wish to set up a designated contact for "small sources" in each state to work with those sources to help them comply with the requirements of the clean air act. who could be against that. we are . that is perfectly agreeable. second. they want to establish a system at both the federal and state level to assure that technical assistance will be provided to small sources to help these small sources in their efforts to comply with the act. fine. agreed to. third. they want "small sources" to have some assurance that compliance with a permit issued to them under the act will protect them against disruptions by the government. or against allegations they are  in compliance. fine. agreed to. these are good ideas. and they should be incorporated into the legislation. i would be pleased to join. as i am confident the distinguished senator from montana would be. with the sponsors of this amendment to effect the proposed changes to the mitchelldole agreement to accomplish these goals. in fact. i have submitted revised language to the sponsors of the amendment that will do exactly that. however. . this amendment would undercut health and techogy standards for air toxics and urban smong-
obviously. i have to consult with my colleague. the. distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. but. yes. the senator put his finger on the problem that bothers me. one hundred tons is a lot of emissions. and we are talking toxics here. this is  vocs. these are toxics. to say that 100 tons we are going to treat in some special manner because somehow that qualifies as a small source i find deeply disturbing. i k. i repeat. i k both the distinguished sponsors of this amendment are  casual about the health of our people. so i would hope we could work something out. several senators addressed the chair.
then. if the senator makes spnse. so we give the accused a would be good egh to explain to chance to be heard by the administrame what he is doing on. pages 6 and 7. tor. the adminstrator may change the where. hei will read- the language: order. or he may decide  to change "modify or revoke and reissue a the order. .permit if epa promulgates regulations iet us take the example that he does after the permit is *issued. and modifi-  change it. then it has to be comcation of the permit to implement piled with. i mean. this is  a great duch regulations isnecessary ider big game of delay. there is pollution to protect against serious: risk to occurring out there. it is either harmpublic health." r t ful to health or harmful to the envithere it is.- right there. there is ronment. whatever it is. it is harmful. hing about just harmful to health. so says the administrator of epa  . why the senator has "something onr. just .in the original assessment. but pages 6 and 7 that seems: to. be comn- after having a hearing and listening to pletely contradictory is totally confus- the accused come forward with his deingand seems to me just- grit for the fense. ourts " . what does the nickles amendment furthermore. i do  find anything do.. the nickles amendment inserts a here dealing with the environment.. i whole. series of layers in between. in do  see where he zcovers a situation between the time of : accusation. the such as:mercury. ithink he would ac- time to say. hey. clean up what you kledge mercury may : be harm are doing over there. stop polluting ful directly to health. a serioud risk to the river. stop emitting these ious public. health. ce(rainly. it is i ot in fumes. more than ious. they are the short run. sure: in the long run it toxic. - . is. but mercury is dangerous to the.en- this. is what senator nicaizs vironment. : .  amendment does. firsttof all. heprolet us look and see whitl this.legslw vides -for a formal triallike hearing tion is all about. we look at the. exi4t- before an administrative. law judge. mind you. meanwhile. on goes the pollution. hing happens. then if the company does  like that one. and that has taken 6 months or so. what can it do. what can the company do. it. can appeal. there was some talk previously by the distinguished senator from alabama about cluttering up the courts withappeals. this amendment of the senator from oklahoma and the senator from alabama provides for appeal. provides for going to court.
. i do  think we ought to get bogged down in the discussions here that the epa favors the nickles amendment. the epa wrote the original language. the epa wrote the original text that dealt with enforcement and permits. the administration.  the epai think everybody who has dealt with this bill ks that epa has been subordinated in the discussions here. the decision is  being made by the epa here. those in superior ranks within the white house decided that what the epa did in the first version was wrong and. indeed. if the senator from oklahoma were prepared to accept the epa version. which namely was the first draft. the part of s. 1630 that is in this legislation. we would be perfectly prepared to accept it. i must say. if you do  like the way something is done in this chamber. you refer to it them bureaucrats. the bureaucrats wrote that section. apparently. . i do  think it is really fair to demean those in the epa. but. etheless. that version has been rejected by the administration. so they have come forward with a modifying amendment to correct what they disapproved of. the. original epa language in 163. i agree with the characterization that has been attached to the nickles amendment by the senator from montana. this does substantially change the bill. call it a gutting. amendment. look at some of the language that has been used. we went through this yesterday. but to revise you must indicate that the revisions are only to protect against a serious risk to public health. in other words. if the modification can be justified on the basis that a serious risk to public health is incurred prior to the modification being accepted. then you can see what a hurdle one has to get over to modify the permit. who can prove a serious risk to public health is going to come from this pollution. that is a far higher standard than in existing law. furthermore. we pointed out yesterday. and i think it is so important. the ability of the polluter to stall and stall and stall. under the procedures that the senator from oklahoma provides in his amendment. why. the polluter first can go and have his case heard before an administrative law judge10 months. after that. he can appeal. everybody ks how long it takes for an appeal to be reached in a federal district courtmaybe 2 years. maybe 1i% years. and after that he can appeal again to the court of appeals. clearly. this process is going to take 4 to 5 years. and yet that is what is provided. on goes the polluter. we do  permit that. that is  permitted under any of our environmental laws. it is  permitted under the clean water act. it is  permitted under rcra. it is  permitted under superfund. and yet they permit it under this amendment. the whole basis of this act is to protect public health. public health and the environment. this is being substantially undermined by the nickles amendment. so i hope that all senators join in the efforts to defeat this amendment. which seriously undercuts the enforcement of this act. the whole act is dependent on permits and enforcement. absent those. the act just becomes a heavy paper bound volume.
. i -ask if the amendment we are on reads. in the first line. "the head of each federal agency may in consultation with the local health * * ." am i correct that the word "may" is substituted for "shall".
. first of all. i want to commend the senator from missouri for his initiative that he is taking with this legislation which he just introduced. it certainly is a fine one. the whole idea of getting young children started early on education and good health precedures and getting the parents so deeply involved as he proposed is an excellent one. i support it.
. the problem of access to health care for the uninsured is an issue which has received much attention in recent months. i believe that this will be the most important domestic issue facing our nation in the 1990s. we all k the grim statistics. frustration about the cost of our system is voiced by governments. corporations. employees. and health care providers. we are spending $660 billion per year. or almost $2 billion every dayfor a system that serves far too many of us poorly or  at all. thirtysome million americans. 75 percent of whom are in working poor families. have health insurance. and thus extremely limited access to any health care. we spend a greater percentage of our gross national product on health care than any other nation in the world. yet the united states lags behind most of these countries on key measurements such as infant mortality and life expectancy. as a society. we are living a handtomouth existence with regard to health care. we dont k where the next meal is coming from. and we dont have a plan for the future. we drift from one crisis to the next. scraping together just egh of what is needed at the timewhether it be money or political willto get us past the problem immediately at hand. and until we address this fundamental flaw. we will continue to see the signs of backlash at a health care system that does too little at too great a cost. we must develop a national strategy for addressing the health care needs of americans. the question is how. i -believe we need to take a twotrack approach. first. we must enact a structural reform of our entire health care system. second. because this reform will take some time. we must continue to make incremental improvements in our 6xisting programs. as this debate progresses. we must examine a number of difficult issuesissues such as whether or  we should build on our current system or adopt a complete reform. we must examine such options as insurance market reform. malpractice relief. employer mandates. managed care. beneficiary costsharing. and financing. since july of last year. i have been working with a group of my colleagues to find a solution to the problem of the uninsured. this group is bipartisan and made up of both members of the finance committee and the labor and human resources committee. today. we are releasing an option paper. and ask interested groups to comment. i have to believe that with a plan. we could make $660 billion go much further. i have to believe that by setting some priorities. grappling with the really tough questions. and yes. making some tough choices. we could deliver appropriate care to every citizen for close to what we are spending . we can restructure our health care system. reorder our priorities. and devise a way to deliver appropriate health care to every american. we ought to be able to do that for $660 billion per year. but to do it will take commodities that are even more scarce than money these days: creativity. sacrifice. and a great deal of political will. it will also require the cooperation and assistance of health care providers and the business community. i look forward to receiving comments on our option paper. i thank my colleagues who have taken part in this working group and i hope that we can continue to work together toward an agreement which will solve this crisis in our health care system.
. this amendment would extend the current duty suspension for lasamid. a chemical used in the manufacture of furosemide. a widelyused potent diuretic. primiarly prescribed in the treatment of patients who have suffered from congestive heart failures. furosemide is currently sold in the united states by hoechstroussel pharmaceuticals. inc. and by several other generic drug companies. however. the only company which manufactures furosemide in the united states is hoechst celanese corp. all other furosemide sold in the united states is imported. hoechst celanese produces furosemide in my state of rhode island by a process which involves the intensive treatment of the precursor chemical lasamid. there are kn american producers of lasamid. and its only use is as a precursor to the production of furosemide. by continuing the duty suspension for lasamid. this u.s. producer of furosemide will be more competitive with foreign producers. thereby benefiting the american workers who manufacture this product. it will also contribute to keeping down medical costs. by reducing costs to produce a major drug relied upon by many americans. the current duty suspension for lasamid is scheduled to expire on december 31. 1990. this duty has been suspended for less than 2 years. since the enactment of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988. public law 100418. this extension will provide 2 additional years and will give us time to study the effect of the duty suspension on the pharmaceutical industry to determine if we should then repeal the duty outright or continue the suspension for aher period. i hope the managers of the bill will be able to accept this controversial amendment.
. today i am introducing legislation that reforms medicare reimbursement for community health centers. i introduced similar legislation last year that included reimbursement reforms for community health centers under med.icare and medicaid. we were able to enact the medicaid provisions. and i am reintroducing the medicare provisions which were  adopted. we have neglected an important. and perhaps critical. resource in our fight to improve basic health care servicescommunity health centers. over the years. i have come to the conclusion that community health centers should be our first line of offense in this effort. i believe that health centers are a crucial link in ensuring adequate health care for those who do  have insurance. there are over 900 health clinics in the united states. these clinics provide primary and preventive services. as well as acute care. to approximately six million americans who might otherwise have here to go for medical care. although these centers are providing the type 8 care that we would most like to encourage. primary and preventive care. our investment in their efforts is falling short. medicare payments do  adequately cover the reasonable costs of providing care. because the method of reimbursement for providers in this program is completely unsuited to health clinics. as a result. many health centers are being forced to use limited public and private grants to subsidize the medicare program. this situation has hampered the clinics ability to provide care to the uninsured. moreover. because health clinics serve a disproportionate share of lowincome medicare and medicaid patients. there is virtually capacity to shift costs. the legislation i am introducing today would change the method of reimbursement under medicare. and take into account the unique situation and composition of health clinics. this bill will increase the flow of federal dollars into community health centers. allowing them to provide health care to a greater number of patients whether they are medicare or medicaid eligible. or have insurance at all. last year i worked closely with my colleagues to pass what i believe was a first step toward increasing reimbursement for community health centers. the legislation increased payments to community health centers for services provided to medicaid patients. the bill that i introduce today will provide the same increased reimbursement under medicare. that we achieved under medicaid last year. our legislation changes the medicare reimbursement method for community health centers. insuring that the federal government will cover 100 percent of the reasonable cost of providing medical care. this is especially important for health centers which serve a high percentage of medicare patients. the estimated cost of this proposal is $10 to $15 million. and would allow community health centers to serve an additional 250.000 people. for those of us who are actively involved in finding a solution to the number of individuals in this country who do  have access to health care. this proposal is a reasonable interim step. community health centers can and do play a critical role in our efforts to improve access to health care for all americans. we have a choice: we can continue to reimburse our health centers inadequately. increasing the number of americans who can find adequate health care. or we can provide reasonable reimbursement to community health centers. increasing the number of americans who can find needed health care services in the most appropriate setting. i believe the choice is clear.e by mr. garn (for himself and mr. moynimtn):
. i am pleased to be joined by senators harkin. deconcini. and cranston in introducing the substance abuse treatment corps act. this legislation is designed to recruit critically needed health professionals to provide drug and alcohol abuse counseling and treatment in underserved areas. one of the most powerful weapons in fighting the war on illegal drugs is treatment. by helping addicts conquer their dependence on drugs we reduce demand. over the past 5 years. we have recognized this and more than doubled federal funding for treatment programs. yet the availability of appropriate counseling and treatment programs remains severely limited. in 1989. approximately 1.400.000 individuals were admitted to alcohol and drug treatment programs. nearly 70.000 people. however. were on waiting lists for assistance. and over 10 million additional people were identified as needed some form of treatment. the lack of health care professionals who are qualified to provide drug and alcohol treatment is a primary reason that care remains unavailable for so many. part of the problem is that substance abuse counselors often shy away from providing services in innercity or rural settings. the implications of the unavailability of treatment and counseling for those with drug and alcohol problems. particularly adolescents. are very serious. the substance abuse treatment corps [satc] would help expand access to these critical services in both urban and rural settings. under our bill. health professionals would be recruited to provide drug and alcohol abuse counseling and treatment in underserved areas through a scholarship program that assists people in financing their education and training and a loan repayment program that repays a portion of an individuals school loans. for each year an individual receives assistance. through either the scholarship or loan repayment program. the individual must provide 1 year of alcohol and drug abuse treatment in an underserved area. many corps members are likely to be placed in community health centers. rural health clinics. community mental health centers and other facilities serving lowincome populations.
 the senators question is a very good one. and i might have misstated. in my brief opening statement. the situation. if the patient goes to a clinic that is receiving title x funds. and that patient might be paying a modest amount on some sliding scale. that patient can receive the full information from the physician. in other words. despite the fact that there are a variety of patients. some who are very low income.  paying anything. some who are paying a modest amount. as i say. on some sliding scale. the clinic itself is bound by the title x regulations. even though the amount that the clinic receives is very modest. and the same rules apply to the doctors advising all patients. in other words. the doctor can give any of the patients the full information. the doctor is prohibited. even upon request from a patient. from saying to that patient she has option a. b. c. or d. and one of those is termination of pregnancy. so i am glad the senator asked that question. because i did  want to convey any confusion.
. serving in the u.s. senate is sometimes a humbling experience. i spoke fervently. perhaps  eloquently. on this measure. and made the points that i thought were pertinent. and then the distinguished senator from utah rose and. apparently. had  hung on every word i said. indeed. far from it. he had  hung on any of the words i said. so he raised points that i thought we had explained very carefully to start with and. indeed. i spoke about them this morning. so i want to briefly repeat. if i might. that contrary to what the senator from -utah said. the very distinguished senator. who is kledgeable in this field. there is money provided in title x for abortion. that is agreed to. we set that aide. there is argument over that. indeed. there is encouragement for abortion under the language as it exists under title x . or under the amendment that i have. what we are saying. simply. is just as for 18 years of the 20year life of this measure. that lowincome women who are pregnant. who are seeking information. be given that information. and that it be directive. i mean. the distinguished senator from utah. somehow has the impression that there is encouragement for abortion because the doctor is asked by this lowincomewomanfrequently teenagers-"doctor. what are my options." and the doctor gives the options. but the language is clear that they must be directive. in other words. he can say. well. you can carry the baby to term. you can. when the baby is born. have adoption or foster care. but i strongly suggest that you seek pregnancy termination. that is  permitted. and so the points are. that there is money provided for abortion under the chafee amendment. that it is only in response to a request from the woman that the doctor gives her the options. finally. it must be directive. there can be encouragement for a. b. c. or d. indeed. we have had experience under this in the past. if the doctor does  want to do that. does  want to respond. he can say. "i am  going to give you the options. but you can go elsewhere where they will outline the options." this is in response to a problem raised earlier by senator armstrong about the religious hospitals. where they do  even want to mention any of these subjects.
if such a place exists. i can quarrel with the information the senator might have. all i k is that the typical situation is a community health clinic where there are abortions performed. they are operating under other federal guidelines. and as we all k. federal money can go to provide abortions for lowincome women. or any women. so. . this is strictly an argument that i am making. and this amendment is for better health care for women. we want them to come to these clinics. we want them to k they are offered the full options. i think. in a true sense of compassion. i do  think we want to have these women refused information that they could obtain if they could afford to go to a regular doctor. by a regular doctor. i mean a doctor they could afford to go to. because obviously there are full medical certified m.d.s in these clinics. if they could afford to go to the doctor. and they said. please give me my options. that doctor would be required to give them the full range of options. so we wish to provide it under this amendment. i reserve the remainder of any time i might have.
. i have 18 seconds. i merely will say that for 18 years what i am proposing here. worked successfully. i hope we can return to that successful system. my amendment deals with fostering better health care to assure that lowincome women have access to the best possible health care.
madam president. first of all i want to commend the senator from tennessee for his remarks in connection with the population explosion that is taking place in the world. this matter is a subject he has been long interested in and has presented graphs and other pictorial matter showing exactly what is happening in the growth of the population of the world. i think is is so helpful that he continues to sound that theme. sound the alarm. because clearly something has to be done. last friday evening the senate voted by 57 to 41  to table the wirth amendment to reverse the socalled mexico city policy of the united states. we voted on the tabling motion because those opponents to the wirth amendment would  allow an upordown vote on the issue. that is what the senator from colorado is seekinga vote. he said he would agree to a time limit. he would be accommodating in any fashion to be helpful. but he wanted to have a vote. i think that is a very fair requirement that he has. and request. so it is my hope that the senate will be allowed to take a vote on this important issue so that we can complete action on the foreign operations appropriations bill that is before us and move on to other pending matters. i support senator wirths amendment. as the vote on last friday evening clearly signifies. a majority of my colleagues. our colleagues in this senate. a majority. 57. likewise support the wirth amendment and would like to reverse the socalled mexico city policy. during consideration of the legislation to reauthorize title x which involves family planning programs here in our country. as the distinguished junior senator from colorado pointed out last friday when he made these remarks. i offered an amendment to reverse the health and human services regulations. department of hhs regulations. which prohibit title x clinicsthese are family planning clinics in the united states from giving abortions but from counseling pregnant women on abortion as an option. and indeed. it goes further than that. the current regulations say that if a woman asks. "what are my options." the doctor can volunteer. if the pregnant woman says. "well. doctor. what are my options." in out-. lining the options. under the existing regulations from the health and human services. the doctor can state that abortion is an option. i wanted to change that and say that when the patient asked the doctor. "doctor. what are my options." that the doctor would be permitted to be forthright. to be honest. and indeed  to be guilty of malpractice. by saying. in answer to the woman patients question. "these are your options."  fostering one above the other.  urging it or saying. "i will supply you with an abortion." if such be the case.  e of that. all that i sought was that the doctor be able to answer the patients question. and. by the way. we are talking about those in the low ecoic categories. we are  talking wealthy people. we are talking people who have very limited resources and are unable to go elsewhere. if they could afford to go to a private doctor. the doctor would tell them. but under the current policy. the doctor can list the four options. we had a vote on that. and my amendment was approved by the senate 62 to 36. so thus it seems to me. madam president. that a strong bipartisan majority of the senate has spoken on this issue. the issue before us this evening is simply an international version of what was addressed in my amendment. the mexico city policy was annced in 1984 by the united states representatives to the international conference on population. which took place in mexico city. this was 6 years ago. what does that policy say. it prohibits the distribution of u.s. population assistance funds. we can distribute our funds from the u.s. government to the indiges. to local. private family planning agencies overseas that provide information. again. it is  that they provide abortions. it is that they provide information about abortion or abortion service& so even if u.s. funds are represented by a small portion of the overall fund that each clinic has. the clinic can spend any of its fundse of its funds. which are being used to pay a doctor. a nurse. midwife. or whatever it might be. can be used for providing neutral counseling on abortion. even if abortion is clearly legal in the country where the clinic is situated. some 300 organizations across the world have agreed to the terms of the mexico city policy. and they have agreed to them because most of these organizations i have talked about were created by the agency for international development. aid. without aid funds. they could  function. because of the mexico city policy. these organizations are thus forced to make a choice. they can choose  to adhere to the policy and lose the funds. or they can sign up for the policy and provide inadequate information to pregnant women. what a choice. what is the effect of this policy. i have an article from the boston globe in 1989 which provides a frightening illustration of the impact of the policy. i ask unanimous consent that this article may be printed in the record at this time.
i certainly would appreciate that. it is my understanding senator glenn is sponsoring legislation on the grade problem. but it is the medical malpractice i would also appreciate it if the distinguished chairman would take a look at. could i ask one other thing. i ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor. is this one bill the chairman is introducing .
. i am pleased that today we are introducing a bill which. when implemented. should prevent the exposure of thousands of our school children to dangerous levels of radon gas. three years ago i introduced the radon in schools detection act. a bill which required epa to determine the extent of radon contamination in the nations schools. this bill was later combined with legislation introduced by senator mitchell. to form the radon program development act of 1988. the senate unanimously approved this legislation. and it was subsequently signed into law. epa is currently implementing this law by providing seed money to states to develop radon programs. issuing publications alerting homeowners to the potential health effects of radon. identifying epa approved contractors and testing labs. and conducting a preliminary assessment of radon in our schools. the results of this preliminary assessment are alarming: 54 percent of the 130 schools tested had at least one room with radon levels above the epa recommended action level. the legislation we are introducing today builds on the work we began in the last congress. this legislation. introduced by senator lautenberg and myself. requires schools located in radon high risk areas to test for radon. these high risk areas are being identified by epa pursuant to the radon bill which i and other members of this committee authored in the last congress. the legislation further provides a loan and/or grant program of $5 million for each of 5 years for schools which need to mitigate radon. and need financial assistance to do so. although some mitigation work can be costly. most mitigation consists of adjustments to ventilation. installation of fans. and depressurizing and sealing a foundation. these techniques do  usually cost a great deal. it is important that we take steps to protect our children from radon gas. which could be claiming as many as 16.000 lives per year. radon has been identified by the environmental protection agency as the largest single source of lung cancer other than smoking. i encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.o by mr. deconcini:
s initiative. so it is my hope our colleagues will support senator bonds amendment. but we should  do so at the expense of other equally critical programs which are strained. so i hope the conference committee will include language in its report that would prohibit "reprogramming of already limited funds from the community health centers and from the maternal and child health block grant. these are my thoughts on this subject. i do  k :what the distinguished senator from. missouri plans to do  with this. but i commend him for his efforts. and even if" for example. he should withdraw it because of the financial problems--i am  sure how he proposes to proceedhe has made an oustanding contribution in calling attention to this matter and stressing that we just can rob peter to pay paul. we can take the funds from these very worthwhile programs. namely the community health centers and the maternal and child health block grant in order to fund these other areas. i thank the chair.
. i am a staunch supporter of the wic program and indeed join every year with the senior senator from arizona to push for increases in the wic funding. i do  object. to the amendment by the senator from vermont. however. i do have some. concerns about it. frankly. i regret- that we have started down this path atall. it seems to me that what we have done is approve a dairy price: increase for fluid milk. then. realizing that an increase will almost certainly hurt nutrition programs such as wic. we are  in the process of adding a very complicated provision to offset any additional costs to the wic program. it seems to me to be needlessly complicated and indeed to be starting down a new. untried policy path. some of the problems: first. this amendment would safeguard wic. or at least it is intended to. but it leaves the dairy processors and the consumers out in the cold. they still have to pay for the price increase. second. with regard to the wic offset. this sets up a complicated chain of aid: the government raises prices. that helps dairy farmers. they in turn must subsidize wic participants. all this subsidizinga circle of subsidiesgets extremely complicated. and it is  good policy. third. at least with regard to the class 1 milk prices. all this is temporary. all this fuss is for an 8month change in prices. in sum. i hope tnat the conference committee will review these dairy/ wic amendments carefully. frankly. all this might have been avoided had this bill been studied in committee. and studied thoroughly. then we might have been able to evaluate the bill with better information about its impact.
. today i join with several of my colleagues in introducing legislation to provide critical health care services to our nations medically underserved populations. in recent years we have witnessed rising concern about the problems in our health care system. and a growing number of americans agree that the time has come to move forward with solutions. some fear that our businesses will continue to lose their competitive edge in international markets in part because of the skyrocketing cost of providing health insurance to employees. others are appalled at the prospect of health care costs which are projected to consume up to 25 percent of our gnp in the near future. still others express concern over the 30 million americans who do  have health insurance. one third of those being children. we have attempted to address this aspect of our health care problem in recent years by increasing medicaid coverage for our most vulnerable citizens: lowincome children and pregnant women. i have been a strong supporter of these expansions. yet. insurance. be it public or private. is of little help if providers are unavailable or unwilling to accept it. likewise. we all have heard about rural areas in this country where there are physicians to deliver infants or provide prenatal care. we have heard of pregnant women coming to innercity hospital emergency rooms in labor. having had absolutely prenatal care. we have been shocked at the increasing number of children who are  receiving critical immunizations. thus. often the problem is  that they are uninsured. but that there is a shortage of providers who will accept them as patients. i firmly believe that we must strive to assure that every american has access to appropriate and affordable health care services. the proposal we are introducing today is designed to assist in achieving this goal. this legislation creates a part b in the medicaid program. the purpose of this new part is to bolster existing costeffective. high quality health care delivery systems such as community health centers. and to encourage the creation of similar entities. under our legislation. health centers can apply to the secretary of health and human services for funds to enhance their ability to provide health care services to those who are medically underserved. these funds can be used to increase services. recruit and train staff. purchase necessary supplies and equipment. reate -and expand facilities. and with the approval of the secretary. expand to new sites. since our purpose is to get the highest quality and greatest value for our health care dollar. the vast majority of funds will go to federally qualified health centers [fqhcs]. we are focusing on fqhcs because they have a proven track record. they provide costefficient primary. preventive. and acute care services. fqhcs must be located in medically underservcd areas or health manpower shortage areas. this requirement guarantees that they are located where they are most needed. they are communitybasedthe governing board must have at least 51 percent participation by consumers. they must provide a full range of primary and preventive care services. and they must either provide services to all who request care. or if they are at capacity. place them on a waiting list. they are required to collect for services provided to individuals who have insurance. and charge a slidingscale fee to uninsured individuals based on their ability to pay. most importantly. they provide quality care. fqhc physiciam must be board certified or boardeligible. and the centers must be recertified by the secretary of hhs annually. who will be helped. those who are currently underserved. thosewho are eligible for public programs such as medicaid. even those covered by a private insurance plan. why. because if they live in a medically underserved area. they all have one thing in common. they may  be able to find a physician or health care provider to take them. this legislation will cost $2.8 billion over the next 5 years. community health centers currently provide health care services to approximately 6 millon individuals. waiting lists at these centers average about 6 months. the national association of community health centers estimates that this proposal will allow them to serve an additional 7.5 million patients by while the facilities eligible for these funds under our legislation are primarily fqhcs. we have included a 10 percent set aside for other organizations that meet most of the same requirements. this provision is intended to encourage local communities to redesign how care is provided to the underserved. all too often. there is coordination of services. and patients do  receive the most appropriate care. a prime example of this is those individuals who receive most of their health care services through hospital emergency rooms. under this proposal. a group of providers could establish a referral center for emergency care. while this proposal may  be the answer to all of our systems shortcomings. it will be an important component of any comprehensive solution. if we are serioas.about reforming our health care system. we must take a hard look at our ecisting delivery systems. we must choose the services and the providers that are delivering the most cost effective. high quality and appropriate care. and we must encourage and support them. this bill does just that. i urge my colleagues to join with us in sponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of the bill and the text be included in the record immediately following my remarks.
that is right. what we have done. as the distinguished senator ksand he has been a great supporter of community health centerswe provide grants to pay for the operation of these centers. but grant dollars can be used for capital expansions. so we have established. under the medicaid program. a part b. through which these centers would receive funds for training and recruitment of personnel for capital investment. and expansion of the current number of community health centers.
. yesterday. i was pleased to join with my colleague from new jersey in introducing two bills that will help our nations most vulnerable population. our children. as a nation. we will spend $660 billion this year on health caremore than any other nation. yet we dont even rank in the top 10 on key health indicators such as infant mortality. low birth weight. and immunizations.. in recent years. i have worked toward passage of several bills which expanded medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children. i believe that these expansions have been instrumental in increasing the number of lowincome pregnant women and children who have access to health care services. until we are able to enact reform in our health care system. it is critical that we continue to make incremental improvements in our existing system and focus our limited dollars on providing increased access to health care services for our nations children. the proposal that we are introducing will continue in that effort. the first proposal is the infant mortality and childrens health act of 1991. as recently as 1988. the united states ranked 21st among other industrialized nations in childhood mortality. we all recognize the value of adequate prenatal care. we spend millions of dollars each year on neonatal intensive care for infants. who are born premature. for a fraction of this. we can provide prenatal services to pregnant women. by some estimates. for every dollar spent on prenatal care for a lowincome woman. more than $3 is saved during the first year of her childs life. and as much as $400.000 can be saved over the childs lifetime. under current law. states have the option of providing medicaid coverage to pregnant women with incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty level. this legislation requires states to phasein medicaid coverage of pregnant women and infants living in families with incomes below 185 percent of poverty. in addition. the bill allows states to provide medicaid coverage to children up to age 6 with incomes below 185 percent of poverty. the second proposal we are introducing is the childhood immunization improvement act. in 1981. the centers for disease control stated that measles could be eradicated in the united states by the middle of the decade. yet. last year more than 27.000 cases of measles were reported. this is 18 times the number which occurred in 1983. sixty of these cases resulted in death. these needless deaths could have been prevented if children had been adequately immunized. childhood immunizations are the most costeffective health service available today and result in cost savings as high as $23 for every $1 spent. yet here in the united states. many preschool children. especially poor children in innercity and rural areas. are  receiving timely immunizations. these young children are at the greatest risk. the increases in immunization preventable disease has been greatest among these preschool children. our legislation will address these problems by increasing the federal match rate for immunization activities under medicaid to 90 percent federal participation. in addition. the bill requires states to reimburse providers under medicaid for the actual cost of providing the vaccine. further. cdc is asked to develop a model delivery system to ensure that vaccines are easily accessible to state and local health agencies. these two bills represent aher step in the great strides we have made in recent years to improve the delivery of health care services for pregnant women and children. i urge my colleagues to join with us in sponsoring these bills.*
. the senator states that i have observed that this would reduce insurance premiums. i am  sure i ever said it would reduce insurance premiums. i hope that it would hold them steady or reduce the rate of increase that is occurring in the insurance premiums. the argument that comes up hereand particularly in the health billfor motorcyclists is the following* motorcyclists say they have the right to ride the motorcyclesthey are harleydavidsonswith the wind blowing through their hair. without a helmet. if they get into an accident that is their business. if. indeed. it were their business. we would  be here on this present matter we are discussing. the trouble is it is  their business. it endsup being a cost to the citizens of the united states of america.  of wisconsin.  the citizens of wisconsin. or illis. kentucky. or rhode island. or wherever it might be. through medicaid. the citizens of the nation end up paying half or more of the bills of these individuals who are terribly injured in motorcycle accidents. there is question that those who ride without helmets suffer vastly more severe injuries than those who have helmets. and what happens. they end up comatose in the state hospitals with medicaid picking up 50 percent or more of the bill. that is why we came forward with this legislation. i appreciate the observations of the senator from wisconsin on it. i am thankful he has brought these views to the attention of the body as a whole.
second. the regulations are illconceived because they create a twotiered system of health care where lowincome women receive more limited information and care than women who can afford private medical services. what these regulations do is say to wealthy women. "you go in this line because there you can pay for all the information you need. but you poor women. you go over in aher line. you have money. therefore. the government will help you. but. because the government is paying. we will decide what you can and can k about your legal and medical options."  some people may say this is fair. after all. if the government is paying for these services. the government has a right to decide what those services should include. the supreme court went even a step further. stating in its majority opinion that the "constraints on such a womans ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product  of government restrictions. but of her indigency." and what does this mean. . i ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the r :cod.
. i want to say a few words about the amendments before us. and our efforts to come up with effective methods of preventing the transmission of hiv infection from health care workers to their patients. the amendment proposed by the senator from th carolina would make it a federal crime carrying a minimum 10year prison sentence for an hivinfected health care worker to provide treatment to a patient without disclosure of his/her hiv infection. the amendment proposed by senator dole will require states to adopt the centers for disease control guidelines. there is question that hiv infectionand aidsis one of the most significant health problems facing our nation today. most people infected with the human immueficiency virus. or hiv. will develop aids. which is always fatal. despite the tremendous gains made by the medical community over the past decade in broadening our understanding of this deadly virus. and its affect on the bodys ability to ward off infection. we are still  close to achieving a definitive vaccine or treatment. we have. however. learned a great deal about how this virus isand is transmitted. there are situations where health care workers have been infected while they were caring for hivinfected patients. these situations. although tragic and heartwrenching. are relatively few in numberonly 40 cases out of the several million people in the united states estimated to be infected with hiv. what about the transmission of the virus from a health care worker to a patient. weve all seen the recent report about the apparent transmission of hiv from an infected dentist to patients in his practice. this situation. while horrifying in its impact on these individuals lives. appears to be unique. of the 1.5 million people estimated to be infected with hiv in the united states. only five have been infected by a health care provider. and all five of these unfortunate individuals were infected by the same florida dentist. studies about hiv transmission have identified doctortopatient transmission. health care workers from all professional backgroundsphysicians. nurses. nurses aideshave cared for patients in many different health care settings over the past decade. and yet only this one example has indicated a link of hiv transmission from health provider to patients. clearly something unusual was going on in this dentists practice. and i am sure investigations will uncover these activities. cdc has estimated that the risk of getting hiv infection from an infected surgeon is mlnisculeonetenth the risk of death from anesthesia for surgery. yet because aids is universally fatal. even one case resulting from transmission from a health care worker to a patient is one too many. these cases. although few. must be prevented. the amendments we are considering today seek to accomplish this end through very different mechanisms. the helms amendment will criminalize the medical practice of hiv infected health care workers. the dole amendment reinforces public health principles by requiring states to enforce the newly released centers for disease control guidelines to prevent hiv transmission to patients during exposureprone invasive procedures. i will support the dole amendment because it will effectively accomplish our goal of eliminating the remote risk of transmission from health care workers to patients. it is based on scientific fact and is good health policy. i will  support the helms amendment because i do  feel it will accomplish the goal we desire. and in fact may actually undermine our current hiv prevention efforts. first. we k that an infected physician poses threat to his patient by touching him. by doing a routine physical examination. or performing most examinations. tests. or procedures which we have all undergone in a physicians office. taking a pap smear test or drawing blood poses risk to a patient. studies. show that the only risk which may occurand even then it is a minimal riskis with what are called exposureprone invasive procedures. such as orthopedic surgical procedures. where the doctor may inadvertently nick a glove. yet the restrictions in the helms amendment require disclosure even for procedures which pose absolutely chance for hiv transmission. the restrictions and potential for criminal prosecution are simply too broad. second. since this amendment criminalizes only those providers who k of their hiv infection but continue to practice. it may actually discourage providers from being tested. doctors. fearing criminal liability. could purposely avoid being tested for hiv. that result would be directly counter to the amendments intent. and to good public health practice. i have one final concern about the helms amendment. by requiring providers to disclose their hiv infection. we run a great risk of driving providers from their practices. and thus reducing access to much needed health services. we k that providers who have disclosed their infection have lost their practices. this will deprive these individuals of their livelihood while achieving public health benefit. the centers for disease control. the agency in charge of hiv prevention in the united states. has developed guidelines based on months of research and scientific thinking. the medical community and numerous medical organizations. including the american medical association. have endorsed these guidelines. the dole amendment will reinforce these guidelines through state legislation or regulation. this is the appropriate route for us to take. i have one final concern. by imposing criminal penalties on hivinfected health care workers. we are sending the wrong message to the american people. our public health agencies across the country have been struggling to educate people about the risks of certain sexual behaviors and needle sharing which leads to aids. my fear is that the helms amendment wrongly suggests that health care workers are a source of hiv infection. it deflects attention from where it should be focusedon the far more difficult task of changing personal activities. like sexual behavior and illicit drug use. these are the behaviors that have been well documented to lead to hiv infection. the dole amendment. which supports the cdc guidelines. will  fuel the misinformation and emotion surrounding this issue. the dole amendment is sound public health jiolicy. it is supported by the public health community and the medical community. it will protect the public. but it will  undermine current hiv prevention efforts. that is why i will vote for the dole amendment and against the helms amendment. that is why i believe the public will be better served by the policy and the public health message conveyed by the dole amendment. i hope my colleagues will join me.
. in recent years we have seen significant increases in the cost of health care. one of the areas that i most frequently hear about from my constituents in the increasing cost of prescription drugs. these increases have disproportionately affected the population which most widely uses prescription drugsour nations elderly. according to the congressional budget office. in 1991. average outofpocket expenditures for prescription drugs will likely be $550 per medicare part b enrollee. for some. the cost will be much higher. although medicare covers the cost of prescription drugs while a patient is hospitalized. the program does  cover the cost of outpatient prescription drugs. some seniors do have coverage of such drugs. for those who can afford medicare supplemental insurance policies. or medigap insurance. prescription drugs are usually covered. in addition. very lowincome seniors are eligible for coverage under the state medicaid programs. there are medicareeligible individuals. however. who do  qualify for medicaid. and do  have insurance coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. for these seniors. the cost of daily medication for a condition such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. can severely restrict theii ability to meet other critical living expenses such as food and rent. in some cases they are forced to forgo the medication altogether. without proper medication. these people often wind up in our hospital emergency rooms. at a much higher cost to our health care system. today. i am introducing the prescription drug purchasing assistance for older americans act. this legislation helps make the cost of prescription drugs more affordable to lowincome seniors. this bill gives states the option of extending their medicaid prescription drug program to medicareeligible individuals with incomes below 110 percent of the federal poverty level in addition. this measure would give states the option of allowing those with slightly higher incomes to buyin to the states medicaid prescription drug benefit. states would be permitted. but  required. to charge a premium to persons with incomes between 110 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. this premium. however. would be limited to 5 percent of the individuals adjusted gross income. i am hopeful that this legislation will greatly assist lowincome seniors who are struggling to pay for their medications. or who can afford them at all. i urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record immediately following my remarks.*
. one issue very much on my mind as we work our way through this session of congress is our nations competitiveness in the global marketplace. our ability to compete is  just a function of how many semiconductors we produce. or how quickly we make progress in various forms of research into superadvanced techogy. competitiveness includes our longrange prospects: the depth and relevance of the education we provide to our children. and the diligence with which we bring our entire society into the techogical age. investing in our youth and disadvantaged citizens must be a priority if we aspire to continued leadership in the world ecoy. the bill approved by the senate last night. although  perfect. takes steps toward placing a greater priority on this investment by recommending increased funding in several areas. it shows that the senate  only recognizes the importance of programs. such as the childhood immunizations. head start. the maternal and child health block grant. but also is working to ensure their success. i lend my full support to the appropriations committees proposed 1992 funding levels for the department of labor. the departments employment and training programs reach out to a variety of groups finding themselves on the periphery of the job market. our disadvantaged youth. veterans. senior citizens. and underskilled workers will directly benefit from this years department of labor budget increases through literacy. job training and community service employment programs. these initiatives help tap both latent talent and proven experience. adding to the total human resource our nation has to work with in competing on the world market. in particular. the senate version of h.r. 2707 provides for an increase of $60 million in the job corps program. which includes basic education. vocational training. and job placement for poor youths between the ages of 16 and 21. the job corps initiative is just one of the many ambitious programs i hope will succeed in meeting the needs of disadvantaged young people who have a great deal to offer to their communities and their country. together with making sure that our workplaces are busy. we should endeavor to make them safe. the committees recommended $20 million increase in funding for the occupational safety and health administration [osha] over last years budget marks a commitment toward reaching that goal. the advent of new techogies and higher work standards often places our workers under increased risk of injury. osha has performed well in seeing to its mission. and i encourage my colleagues to see to it that it has the funds to continue in its fine record. in the area of scientific research. the national institutes of health [nih). one of the worlds premier research institutions. would receive almost $9 billon-$683 million more than in fiscal year 1991. in addition to supporting major research projects such as the human gee initiative. this budget will permit 6.040 new research grants to be awarded to scientists at universities and other research institutionsthis is the highest level of new awards since 1988. under the committees proposal the centers for disease control [cdc] would receive $1.5 billion. the cdc has led efforts to prevent diseases such as malaria. polio. smallpox. and more recently aids and hiv infection. the agencys mission is to improve the quality of life for all americans. by preventing unnecessary disease. disability. and premature death by promoting healthy lifestyles. some of the centers at cdc are familiar to us. like the national institute of occupational safety and health [niosh]. others may be less familiar. but less important as efforts to develop effective prevention programs continue. i also would like to e that the senate version of h.r. 2707 increases funding for childhood immunization programs. childhood immunizations are one of the most costeffective health services we have available today. yet. many preschool children are  being immunized because support for the childhood immunization program administered by the centers for disease control has  kept pace with the spiraling costs of these services. earlier this year. i joined senator bradley in initiating a letter urging members of the appropriations committee to increase funding for immunization efforts. i am pleased that the committee favorably considered this request and included $227.8 million for various immunization programsan increase of $60 million over last years appropriation. the senate version of h.r. 2707 also provides full funding-$686 millionfor the maternal and child health [mch] block grant. the mch block grant is a core public health program for children and pregnant women. and serves as one our nations primary defenses against preventable and costly disease and disability among our population. the committees recommendation will support efforts to implement key strategies such as home visiting and onestop shopping. which were included in the reauthorization of the mch block grant 2 years ago. but have  been funded. these strategies have proven successful in making prenatal and pediatric services more accessible. and mothers and children more healthy. by providing over $600 million for community and migrant health centers. the committee recognized the valuable contributions these centers make toward improving the availability of primary and preventive health care services in medically underserved areas. at a time when we are exploring ways to increase access to health care for all americans. and also trying to maximize the benefit for each health care dollar. i believe that our community and migrant health centers are a good investment. i also am pleased that an amendment was accepted to provide $10 million for the trauma care systems planning and development act. which was approved in the last congress. this act is designed to assist state governments in the development and improvement of regional systems of trauma care services. the bill includes a $250 million increase over last years appropriation for the head start program for a total of $2.2 billion. head start offers highquality* preschool experiences that prepare children for entry into elementary school. along with health screenings. and other preventive health care services. overall. the senate version of h.r. 2707 includes $27.2 billion for department of education programs. this budget will provide $6.9 billion for student financial aid programs. which are vitally important as students and their families work to meet rising tuition costs. even with grants. loans. and parttime work. it is sometimes impossible for students to afford the cost of a college education. i have been an active and steadfast supporter of existing student aid programs. such as pell grants. guaranteed student loans. and other forms of assistance. and am pleased by the committees recommendation. having said all that. there are aspects of the bill that cause me concern. first. i regret that the committee did  directly appropriate more funds for medicare contractors. medicare contractors. usually insurance companies. are responsible for reimbursing medicare beneficiaries and providers in a timely manner. in addition. these contractors also provide information. guidance. and technical support to both providers and benefiqlaries. while the committee recommended $1.4 billion for this purpose. a significant portion of this request will remain in contingency reserves. in the past. the indirect funding approach
. i am pleased to support the compromise amendment offered to the family and medical leave bill by my distinguished colleagues. senators bond. ford. and coats. senator bond and senator dodd. the principal sponsor of s. 5. should be congratulated for their efforts to work out an agreement on the family and medical leave bill. every good piece of legislation requires some tradeoffs. some compromises. and todays final product is the result of many years of hard work. i have supported parental leave legislation for a number of years. back in the 100th congress. i joined my friend from connecticut. senator dodd. as a principal cosponsor of the parental and medical leave act of 1988. although that legislation has evolved considerably over the years. todays bill attempts to address the same fundamental issue: how to balance an employees job responsibilities with his or her family obligations. the past quarter century has seen dramatic changes in the makeup of the nations work force. women have entered the work force in record numbers. more and more children are being raised by single parents. and in 9 out of 10 twoparent families. both parents work outside the homeusually out of ecoic necessity. s. 5 would provide employees with 12 weeks of job security in the event that a worker must request leave to care for a newborn. a sick child. or an ailing parent. it would help ease the fears of employees who fear dismissal if they take an unpaid extended leave due to a family emergency. in short. it is a good bill that responds to the changing needs of the american family and the american worker.
. the conference report before us contains a record $2.6 billion for wic. that is an increase of $250 million over last- yearnearly everything we requested. and the single largest increase in funding in wic history. this money will go a long way toward ensuring that mothers receive vital health care. and children growup healthy. i am delighted by the committees actions and again thank them for their strong support. both this year and in past years.
. all along. going back some 3 years . i have been fighting these regulations because they prohibit a poor woman from receiving information about her options. if a woman asks "what are my options.". she is entitled to an answer. this new proposal says that a woman should receive "complete medical information about her condition."  this is ambiguous. at least based on my discussions with the administration. does this mean she will get an answer to her question. i think under this proposal it is quite likely the answer is "" she probably would get information about prenatal care. but  about all her legal and her medical options. this is unfair to a poor woman. it is the kind of restriction on information e of us would accept for ourselves. we are trapping these women simply because they are too poor to pay for private medical care. if they had money they could go to a private health provider and get all the information they want. but because they are poor. the government is saying. "we. the government. will control their access to information simply because we. the government. have this power." this is wrong. the proposal also saysi am talking about the proposal the administration submitted last evening. in other words changing the regulationsa woman may be referred to a full health service provider that also performs abortions. so one might say: "well. what is the problem. she is referred to a full health care provider. that health care provider also performs abortions. so everything is fine. what is the complaint." i have been around and around on this issue with the administration time and time again. the facts are there are very few places which provide abortions and also provide prenatal care. let us take my home state of rhode island. in my state there is only one place. women and infants hospital. that provides full service health care and also provides abortions. and you might think. all right. that is fine. the woman goes there. but what are the facts. this hospital does  provide abortions for a woman in her first trimester that is perfectly healthy. they provide abortions only when there are serious complications involved. so under this proposal. a woman would be sent on to women and infants hospital. for example. and find out there she could . in her first trimester. in an uncomplicated case. receive an abortion. so they would send her to some other place. in other states. there are providers who would meet this qualification. namely a full service health care provider that also performs abortions. to me this is cruel. by sending a woman on to women and infants hospital. in my situation at home. it sends a woman on a wild goose chase. when one of us are referred to a health care provider by a doctor or nurse. we expect to be able to get the service we need at that place. we do  expect to be told by a second stop. "well. go to a third place." these are poor women. we have to remember that. many of them work two or three jobs. many of them have children. they can be expected to traipse all over the state looking for services when the answer at the first stop is readily available. i think also we have to remember we are lucky to get many of these lowincome women into the health care system to start with. finally. let me just say a word about the title x program. this program is intended to increase access for poor women to quality health care services. we get these women into the system. it has been highly successful. it brings women into the health care system who otherwise would have little or access to such a system. it plays a critical role in screening for sexually transmitted diseases and preventing unwanted pregnancies. in many cases the title x programs serves as the entry point for poor women in the health care system. we should be doing all we can to improve the program.  finding ways to make it more difficult for poor women to get basic information. these regulationsdo makematters more difficult and they should be overturned.
. i support the measure before us. there are some very important programs in this bill. many of which i have supported strongly over the yearsincreases in the job corps program. childhood immunizations. head start. and the maternal and child health block grant. to name a few. i am very pleased there is money in there for the lowincome home energy assistance program which helps poor people obtain funds to keep themselves warm in the winter. this legislation also contains language which would postpone for 1 year the implementation of the infamous gag rule which has been discussed previously. i would like to make this clear. this is  an argument about abortion. the title x program does  and has never paid for abortions. rather. the disagreement is over whether a poor woman is entitled to basic information. should she  be able to receive the basic information that a wealthier woman. or a woman who can afford to pay a doctor. would rightfully expect to obtain from a health care professional. i was disappointed that last tuesday the administration released a memo. sent to secretary sullivan. intending to clarify these regulations. since july. i have been negotiating with representatives of the administration to develop a compromise on this issue. we were very close to a solution. and i have  given up hope yet. the letter sent to secretary sullivan lays out aher gag. which is unacceptable. this is an attempt to get rid of the problems with the gag rule without removing the gag. the title x program is intended to increase access for poor women to quality health services. that is what the title x program is all about. it has been a very successful program. it brings women into the health care system who would otherwise have little or access to health care at all. it plays a critical role in screening for sexually transmitted diseases and preventing unwanted pregnancies. in many cases the title x program serves as the entry point for poor women into the health care system. we should be doing all we can to improve this program.  finding ways to make it more difficult for poor women to get basic information. these regulations do make things more difficult and they should be overturned. i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
. today i am joined by 19 of my republican colleagues in introducing the health equity and access improvement act of 1991a proposal which builds on the strengths of our existing health care system and corrects its deficiencies. in july 1990. the republican task force on health care was created by the republican leader. the proposal we are introducing today arose from discussions within the task force and is an attempt to put forward a creative set of ideas that will improve our health care system. it represents a successful effort to develop some common ground among a fairly large and diverse group of republicans. this has been a lengthy process. finding common ground on an issue as challenging and complicated as this is tremendously difficult. if it were . we would have enacted health care reform legislation years ago. consensus is hard to find. but i think weve made a good start with this proposal. our goal was to correct what is wrong with our system. while at the same time building upon those aspects which seem to work. clearly our costs are excessive in comparison with other nations. it is estimated that last year. $660 billionalmost $2 billion per daywas spent in the united states on health care. this is more per capita than any other industrialized nation. yet between 31 and 37 million people. almost half of them children. may be unable to get needed health care services because they lack health insurance or live in an area without easy access to affordable health care providers. our businesses face skyrocketing costs for employee coverage. and this is affecting our ability to compete in international markets. in recent years. the primary cause of labormanagement disputes has been disagreement over who should pay the increased cost of health insurance premiums. in addition. many small employers find it almost impossible to offer health care coverage to employees. aher problem is inequity in the federal tax code. today. a worker in a large company that providesand pays forinsurance receives that benefit without being assessed any tax. on the other hand. an individual who purchases health insurance for his or her family outside of an employer group must use aftertax dollars. likewise. an individual who is selfemployed can deduct only 25 percent of his or her insurance costs. by the same token. our system does have its strong points. approximately 85 percent of all americans have some form of health insurance. our system allows patients to have choices about their health care needs. there are delays in treatment for those who are covered. our medical techogy is the best in the world. . how does our proposal address the strengths and weaknesses in our system.
. first. i want to commend the distinguished senator from missouri for  only his excellent statement. but in this task force. there was more loyal and steady attender at our sessions. or better contributor to our efforts. that senator bond. i appreciate the kind things he had to say about the leadership i gave. but for his efforts and his consistent attendance and contributions. we would  be where we are. i thank him very much. he has had a longtime interest in health care. extending back to when he was gover. briefly. i want to read off the list of cosponsors of this legislation. beside myself. there are: senators dole.
. today i am introducing the medicate mental health improvement act. this. legislation will assure that medicare beneficiaries. who reside in nursing homes. will get needed mental health care. problems with untreated. or inappropriately treated. mental illnesses and behavioral problems are far too common in our nursing homes today. due to inequities in medicare payment for mental health treatment. patients who reside in nursing homes have limited access to psychiatric and psychological services. al too often. when nursing home residents need mental health counseling and treatment. the common response of the attending physician is to prescribe psychoactive drugs. these medications often have unpleasant side effects such as leaving patients confused and causing them to loose their sense of balance. as a result. patients often fall and must be treated for serious physical injuries. how can we improve access to these services. under current law. medicare .s 16852 treats physicians services to nursing home patients as outpatient care. while most medicare outpatient services require patients to pay for 20 percent of the charge. patients must pay for 50 percent of outpatient mental health services. for many medicare patients. particularly those who live in nursing homes. this requirement is a major financial burden. which worsens if they need followup treatment. for others. who may have serious mental illness. the copayment is uncollectible. and further discourages providers from treating nursing home residents. the legislation that i introduce today would simply bring medicare payments for outpatient mental health services for nursing home residents in line with reimbursement for other types of outpatient services. under my proposal. copayments for mental health services for nursing home residents would be reduced from 50 to 20 percent. specialized consultation and treatment for mental illnesses has been proven to help. dramatically. patients who suffer from depression. and illness affecting one in three nursing home residents. this treatment can minimize the need for patient restraints and psychoactive drugs. benefits of this treatment include more precise diagis. careful review of drug regimens. and better identification and treatment of depression. patients will benefit from careful consideration of drug options for treatment. training for nursing home staff on how to better handle behavioral disturbances. and assistance to families to better understand the problem and assist in decisionmaking. one may also see resulting costsavings for the federal government through decreased hospital admissions resulting from the use of inappropriate drugs. in short. treatment can result in better quality of life and wellbeing for nursing home patients. staff. and their families. i urge my colleagues to join with me in cosponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record immediately following my remarks.
. i would like to express my support for senator lautnbergs amendment. this amendment would simply afford women serving overseas in the military the same reproductive rights that they would have had they chosen to remain in the united states. in the past years. we have seen an increasing participation by american women in the u.s. military. we welcome the service of these women. and admire their patriotism and courage. if anything. we should be going out of our way to accommodate these women. who often leave behind children to serve our country. instead. we have a policy which discriminates against them and. in many cases. places them at medical risk. there are many in this body who are opposed to abortion rights. yet the fact remains. that. at least for . in the united states. a woman has a right to terminate a pregnancy if she so chooses. under current law. women in the military and female dependents of those serving in the military may  obtain abortions at military hospitals. an unfortunate 1988 directive prohibits military hospitals from providing abortions. this places these women in the untenable position of having to seek abortions at a health facility in that foreign country. if it is even legal. or to try to come back to the united states in time to have the procedure performed safely. this is terribly unfair. first. in many countries. abortion may  even be legal. thus the woman may be forced to seek an illegal abortion. second. many countries do  have the same standards of health care as we have in the united states. and the woman would be forced to use such substandard care. thus. in effect. women stationed overseas. be they serving in the military themselves or dependents of military families are prevented from obtaining a medical service that is guaranteed by the u.s. constitution. this amendment would allow milltary hospitals to perform abortions and the woman would be required to pay for the service. we are  asking the u.s. government to pay for the service. just to provide women with the same access to health care as she has in the united states. this is fair. and i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
. today i am introducing legislation to make it easier for senior citizens to get needed physical therapy services through the medicare program. these services are critical to individuals who have suffered from such conditions as stroke or heart attack. my bill eliminates an existing $750 cap on payments for physical therapy or occupational therapy provided by therapists in independent practice. under current medicare law. -here is limit to physical therapy services when they are provided either in a physicians office. or on an outpatient basis in a hospital. medicare does. however. limit .reimbursement for services provided by an independent physical or occupational therapist to $750 per calendar year. when a patient who receives services from an independent therapist reaches his or her limit. the patient must either stop treatment. change to a therapist in a physicians .office or a -hospital. or pay for these services outofpocket.  only is it a burden for seniors to change providers. but for those medicare patients who live in areas where there is a shortage of health care providers. a therapist in a physicians office or hospital nay be unavailable. or reachable only by traveling long distances. some may argue that removal of this cap will significantly increase medicare -expenditures for physical therapy services. the health care financing administration fhcfa] howevel has placed the services of these physical therapists under the new medicare physican fee schedule and volume performance standards. these regulations would control payment for services performed by independent practitioners based ion a fee schedule. therefore. an arbitrary cap on reimbursement is longer necessary. beside decreasing the availability of services to senior itizens. the current limit may actually increase costs to the medicare program. according to 1988 data. medicare paid on average $1.62 less for physical therapy services by independent providers than for these same services when provided by a physician. although $1.62 doesnt seem like much. when multiplied by the i billion physical therapy procedures that were billed to medicare in 1988. the cost becomes clear. my legislation would allow patients in need lof physical and occupational therapy to receive these services without having to face the possibility of terminating treatment early. or continuing treatment elsewhere. because .of a predetermined limit on medicare reimbursement. i hope that my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this legislation which assures our senior citizens access to these critically needed services.* by mr. specter:
 has made it possible for us to move forward. we can do something to help many americans in the short term. and i urge those on the other side of the aisle to come to the table and work with us to enact significant health care reform legislation before the ember elections.
. on february 21. the maryland senate voted 3115 for a universal motorcycle helmet law. the senate vote followed the overwhelming approval of the bill by the maryland house and cleared * the measure for the govers signature. four cheers to the state of maryland for being the first state to enact a universal motorcycle helmet law since the passage of the chafeecooper amendment that was part of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1992. four cheers to gov. william donald schaefer for taking the initiative and convincing the assembly of the benefits of this legislation. as the gover said. the first objective of this law is to save lives. this law will also save the citizens of maryland money. a special commission established by the gover says a helmet law will save maryland $1.3 million per year. there are many heros in this story and i can pay tribute to all those who deserve our thanks. but i would like to mention a few. i have already mentioned gover schaefer and the maryland assembly. in addition. there is doug wilson. a 23yearold motorcycle rider who ks firsthand how riding without a helmet can change your life. he is still recovering from head injuries he suffered from a motorcycle accident. he was willing to tell his story to maryland legislators and he convinced them to support the helmet legislation. doug wilson is one person who has made a difference. there were also groups who made a difference and deserve our thanks. one of these groups is the maryland motorcycle helmet coalition chaired by dr. richard alcorta. an emergency physician at suburban hospital. the support of dr. alcorta and his colleagues in the medical community. including particularly the emergency medical services people. was crucial in the passage of the maryland motorcycle helmet law. the entire health care communityincluding doctors and nurses. public health ems. trauma center. and head injury care professionalsdeserves a great deal of credit for the adoption of the chafeecooper amendment. they have been instrumental at the state level in getting safety belt and motorcycle helmet laws passed as well. they see the personal tragedy of motorcycle crashes every day and k all too well what they cost the taxpayers. aher group that worked very hard both at the federal and state level is the advocates for highway and auto safety. a coalition of health. safety. consumer and insurance groups. as soon as the chafeecooper amendment was signed into law. this group went right to work providing whatever assistance was requested by state and local groups who support motorcycle helmet laws. several of its board members. including mothers against drunk driving [maddi and a number of insurance companies were in the forefront in supporting these efforts. four cheers to these people and all those involved who had the courage to do the right thing that will benefit all of us. i ask that an article from the baltimore sun. and a list of the "supporters of marylands motorcycle bill" be printed in the record at this point.
i would like to give 3 of those minutes to senator domenic1. thus i have 4 minutes. i think if we ask the senators on the floor what they are interested in as far as health care goes. there may be differences as to approach and different programs but i think every senator would agree that one of the big steps we can take is in preventive medicine. in other words. keeping people healthy. or. phrasing it aher way. keeping them from getting ill. one of the statistics that is shocking in this is the national academy of sciences issued a report in which the academy estimated that the annual number of lung cancer deaths in the united states attributable to radon in a single year are 16.000. . is that homeowners currently do  have a great deal of confidence that radon measurement devices are providing accurate results. the general accounting office completed a report in august of 1990 which highlighted some of the problems with companies which produce and analyze radon measurement devices. such as the charcoal canister used to test homes. in summary. gao concluded that many of these companies do  have an adequate quality assurance program. and that the radon measurements they report back to homeowners could have a high degree of error. further. since most states do  have regulations covering radon mitigation. as they do for asbestos removal. the cleanups attempted by many radon companies are ineffectual. and there are few followup procedures to assure the radon contamination has been remedied. although epa runs a voluntary proficiency testing program. gao reported that even after companies fail epas test. they continue to market their products. gao recommended that measurement companies: be required to pass the epa proficiency testing program before marketing their. devices. and demonstrate the existence of adequate quality assurance programs as a condition of participating in the epa proficiency testing program. the legislation we are considering today acts on both of these recommendations. and will ensure that important. healthbased decisions are made on the basis of reliable test results. senator mitchell and senator lautenber0 have been very active in their support of radon legislation through the year. i commend their efforts. i hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this worthwhile legislation.
i thank the chair. i thank the distinguished floor manager of the legislation. : prescription drugs represent 7 percent of our total health care expenditures in the united states of america. so that f we are really anxious in getting a grip on the health care expenditures. then let us  deal with just 7 percent. let us wrestle with the other parts likewisethe hospital costs. the doctors costs. the medical equipment costs. everything else that makes up that 93 percent of health care costs which is  represented by drugs. i see the senator from arkansas here and i would appreciate it if he would be good egh. if he has some time. to respond to the particular question that i raised. and i will just restrict it to one. two companies producing the same product that cost them $4 to produce. one charges $5 for the product. the other charges $8. under the proposal of the senator. as i understand it. both companies will be hereafter locked in and only be able to increase their prices in accordance with the cpi or lose a portion of their tax credit under section 936. so the good company that went out of its way to restrict its costs and held down its prices is going to be punished. as i understand the senators proposal. whereas. the company that was charging more will clearly benefit.
we learn from bitter experience. as the senator pointed out. we were both involved in this a couple of years ago. when you push in. a certain area. something happens somewhere else. there is a cause and effect. the particular piece of legislation that the senator referred to was the medicaid rebate law. a company. if it was selling at a low price somewhere. would be required to provide that same price to state medicaid programs. so what happened. they were selling to the va at a 90percent discount. and they would have to continue that discount to medicaid. so. surprise. surprise. they were perfectly content to sell at this low price a very small percentage of their market. but when required to offer that low price to a large portion of their market. they did  continue selling at a 90percent discount. so it is a tricky business we are involved in here once you start with price controls. aher point i might make. . we can do ittrue health care reform that will  just deal with 7 percent of the problem. but will deal with 100 percent of the problem. with a very good chance that we can limit cost increases in our entire health care system in rather a substantial fashion. i thank the chair.
i say this. also: this is politically risky territory as every single one of us ks. but the question is. are we going to be able to do it. i certainly hope we can. i have previously thought the most nagging domestic problem in the balance of this decade was health care. but  i have come to believe it is these deficits.
the majority leader has .set forth a very powerful statement. we have to do something about health care. who is in charge around this place. i thought the majority party ran the senate. and if i might finish. -
. i would like to address the remarks made by the distinguished majority leader while he is here. to the best of my kledge. that is the first time i have heard the distinguished senator make his invitation. certainly to me and to the others on this side. to come forward with him to arrive at a component solution of this health care problem. this is something that the admintstration is eager to do. when i asked the secretary of hhs. before the finance committee: would you join in an effort with the democrats in the senate to try and find a solution to this problem. he said yes. so. to the majority leader. i say three cheers. four cheers in fact. we accept your invitation. and i will relay it to dr. sullivan whenever you want to sit down. and let me say that i do  view this problem as having all of the difficulty that many do. because as i previously stated. there are at least 10 points of commonality to the program we have. to the program the majority leader- has. and to prograias others have. is that going to solve every problem under health care. but it is going to take us a long way in that direction. it seems to me. and. by the way. these points of commonality are  exactly the same. the senators proposal on medical liability reform. for example. is different from the one we have. and the administration indeed has a bill on that very subject. so we can make real progress this year. and i will be there whenever you want to meet. i might say to the majority leader that he did this with great success in connection with the clean air act. if he remembers. the administration did  introduce a clean air bill in the senate. and as i recall the situation. they had proposals which they introduced. as i recall. in the house.
. i point out that what is destroying our ability to take progressive action in the whole series of domestic programs. whether it is health care. whether it is education. or whether it is the environment. is the fact that the deficit is consuming so much money. this year. we will pay $200 million interest. unless we do something about these deficits. we are  going to get to first base with respect to our domestic problems. at least this is an effort. is it perfect. probably . if somebody has a better way of doing it. let us hear it. i must say i have a lot of concerns with it. those on the floor have talked about doing something about those who are better off. but if we did anything in connection with employer deductibility of health insurance premiums. for example. or changing their treatment as taxfree fringe benefitsthere would be an uproar and it would  get anywhere. i k that there are those who have said that this comes down too hard on the health care group. on medicare or medicaid. hopefully this legislation will be a catalyst to make some real programs in those particular areas.
madam president. on tuesday of this week. the senate spent 4 hours debating whether or  to approve the minting of new coins. yet. on that very day. as is the case every day. an average of 27 adults and children across our nation were killed by a handgun. and 39 individuals. americans. went to the hospital to be treated for handgun wounds. of those 39 patients. some will be permanently and severely disabled the rest of their lives. others will go back to their homes and families wondering what kind of a society. what kind of a nation do we have where handguns are so commonplace. we have many demands and many challenges and many problems facing the senate and our nation. and we need to spend far more of our valuable time and of our scarce resources focusiig hot on parochial or petty or political matters. but on those which are most critical to the wellbeing of this country of ours. two among the most pressing issues facing the united states of america are. first. the need to improve the quality of our education. and. second. the need to reduce the costs of our health care systems. but tied inexorably to progress on both of these matters is recognition of the costs placed on the united states of america and its citizens and its taxpayers by our national firearms policy. and that is what i wish to discuss for a few minutes this aftern. if we hope to achieve progress on education. it is imperative that educators be able to spend their time and their resources on their principal task. which is educating our young people. likewise. if we are to move forward on health care. it is critical that we ensure our population is as healthy and as fit as possible. and thus reduce the demand for expensive health care services. yet today. educators are distracted from educating and pupils are distracted from learning by the everincreasing and frightening presence of handguns within our schools. and our efforts to hold down health care costs literally are being shot down by the more than $4 billion required to be spent every year on the ghastly woundings and deaths from handguns. how many handguns are there in this country. it is estimated that there are roughly 66 million of these deadly weapons in the united states today. in 1982. there were only 53 million. that is a 25percent increase in 10 years. according to the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms [batfi. we can expect to add 2 million handguns every year. that is hardly a comforting thought. handgunsthese guns so easily concealed under a jacket or in a shoulderbagcause untold damage and suffering in this--nation. the statistics are staggering. frightening. and shameful. every year. handguns are estimated to be involved in at least 10.000 murders and 15.000 woundingsthat translates to about 27 persons killed and 41 persons injured every day. every year. we set a new record in handgun deaths: since 1988. handgun murderswhich represent 75 percent of all firearms murdershave gone up each year by nearly 1.000 deaths. handguns are involved in an average of 33 rapes. 575 robberies. and 1.116 assaults every day. handguns are responsible for 70 percent of all firearms suicides. about 3.200 of which every year are teen suicides. and it is a disgusting. terrible fact that these guns constitute the most efficient. effective. and lethal suicide method.
. where is the increased incentive for a woman to terminate her pregnancy. in closing. let me just say that once again we are dealing with an issue that is  about abortion. but rather about sound and ethical medical research. unfortunately. there are many who would like support for this measure to be considered a proabortion vote. i maintain that support for this bill is the ultimate prolife vote because allowing this critical research to continue will mean that millions of lives will be prolonged and saved. on march 31. the senate approved the nih reauthorization bill by an overwhelming vote of 87 to 10. i hope that there will be similar support for the conference report before us today.
. the rising cost of health care. and particularly the costs of prescription drugs. threatens the availability of needed services for millions of middle- and lowincome americans. when an existing federal law adds to and encourages these rising costs. federal law must be changed. through this legislation. manufacturers will regain the incentive to once again offer the discounts to public and private purchasers that benefit us all. by mr. metzenbaum:
. i- hope that they will accept the proposals that we have put forward on the 11 points of commonality. expand on them. and do something this year to help contain * health care costs in the united states of america. i thank the chair.
. i see that the managers of the bill are on the floor. so i will let them proceed with the basic underlying legislation. i did think it was important to e that the concerns of the senator from west virginia are valid. and that the republicans stand ready to enact legislation this year in dealing with health care reform. i thank the chair.
. it is critical that we make these changes in the medicaid program in order to improve the delivery of services and to reduce the administrative burden to make the medicaid program more efficient. i urge that we take advantage of an opportunity to simplify eligibility for the people covered by the program and to provide administrative relief for the states that must administer this program. i urge my colleagues to join with senator bradley and me in supporting this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record immediately following my remarks.
. i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by senator lautenbero. and cosponsored by senators bradley. garn. lugar. and myself. this amendment has a simple purpose: it is designed to protect children. while they are particlpating in federally funded programs such as head start. wic. health care. and day care programs. from the debilltating and potentially fatal effects of secondhand smoke. it would accomplish this in a straightforward manner: any federally funded program which is involved in providing direct services such as day care. medical care. or counseling to children under the age of 5 must adopt a moking policy in the facility where such services are provided. the policy need  apply to portions of the facility which are  mally occupied by the children. so long as such portions have a separate ventilation system. . the amendment also provides for a waiver. a program can petition the federal agency or its regional office. explaining in writing the extenuating circumstas which make it difficult or impossible to comply. in such a situation. the program must assure that it will adopt an alternative policy that will protect children from secondhand smoke "to the maximum extent possible."  why are we making such a fuss about this. why are we saying to these programs that you can continue to receive federal funding unless you have taken significant steps to protect children from secondhand smoke. the answer is that recent reports from both the environmental protection agency and the american heart association have provided unequivocal evidence that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to our health. these reports label secondhand smoke "a kn carcien." which poses an unacceptably high risk of respiratory and heart disease. the epa draft report. which adds to similar warnings already sounded by the national research council and the surgeon general. zeros in specifically on the effects of cigarette smoke on children. it concludes that secondhand smoke  only aggravates up to 1 million existing cases of childhood asthma each year but causes 8.000 to 26.000 new cases. the epa report also links secondhand smoke to pneumonia. bronchitis. and reduced lung function and labels it a kn cause of middleear infections. a leading. source of childhood surgery. a recent statement by the american lung association es that children are especially vulnerable to the effects of tobacco smoke because their lungs are still growing. the statement goes on to criticize the federal government for having consistent policy to protect children from exposure to secondhand smoke. the amendment we are offering today is an attempt to correct this problem. if adopted. it will assure that young children. at least during the time they are participating in federally funded programs. will be safe from secondhand smoke. anyone who still argues that secondhand smoke does  pose a serious health risk simply does  want to be confused by the facts. this is a modest but laudable step toward providing protections for the group identified as being most susceptible to the ill effects of secondhand tobacco smoke: .our young children. i urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.
. i would also like to say to the distinguished senator from wisconsin. who has been so active in  just medical liability reform but the whole issue of product liability reform. i commend him for what he has done. however. as in so much legislation we pass here. agreements are reached on what is the possible. what can be achieved and in this package. that is  included. if i had my druthers. it would be. but this is a good package that was arrived at by agreement with the distinguished senator from texas and others. so it would . regrettably. be possible to accept an amendment on medical liability reform and. indeed. i would have to oppose it.
. i e on the floor the distinguished senior senator from pennsylvania who has long worked on health care matters. he is a member of our republican heath care task force. he has been very interested in this. he has spoken on these matters many times on the floor in connection with health vare reform. we will be glad to hear whatever remarks he might have.
. i k the distinguished senator from arizona is here. he will be speaking. i just want to say that he has been also a very active member of the health care task force of the republican senators. has been a regular attendee at our thursday morning 8:30 gatherings. is kledgeable on the subject. and has been intensely interested in health care reform. i am delighted that he will next be speaking.
. the distinguished senator from utah is here. he also has contributed heavily to our deliberations in connection with health care. i look forward to his remarks because he has been intensely interested in this subject. indeed. has submitted legislation in this field.
. i see the junior senator from indiana on the floor. he has been helpful to us in all our health care efforts and attended the meetings at 8:30 in the morning on thursday. so i am delighted that he is here to make some remarks.
. i ask senator domenici be added as a cosponsor. i also want to thank our distinguished leader. senator dole. for  only his kind comments but also for the confidence he put in me. in naming me as chairman for the health care task force and for his wonderful support and that of his staff. ms. sheila burke and others. who have been so effective and helpful. of course i want to thank the members of the finance committee staff and our- staff. likewise. especially christine fbrguson and katherine hayes.
. i see the distinguished senator from kansas is here. i look forward to hearing her remarks. i want to say that senator ksszbaum has been an active member of our group dealing with health care and she has thoughts on it. she has attended our breakfasts at 8:30 on thursday and has herself submitted considerable legislation on this issue. i am delighted she is here.
. i am proud to have supported this legislation since its infancy. back in the 100th congress. i joined my friend from connecticut. senator dodd. as a principal cosponsor of the parental and medical leave act of 1988. todays bill has evolved considerably over the years--adding elder care provisions. for examplebut it still represents my strong belief that worker should be forced to make that terrible choice between caring for a family member and keeping his or her job. as a society. we need laws to protect employees from having to make that awful choice. senator dodd should be congratulated for his efforts to work out a compromise agreement on the family and medical leave bill. last october he worked diligently to forge a compromise with the distinguished junior senator from missourisenator bondthat made two improvements in the senate bill. first. it limited employee eligibility to those individuals who have worked 1.250 hours. or an average of 25 hours per week. over the previous -12 months. and second. it aimed to prevent abuses of the legislation by requiring employees to repay health insurance premiums paid during the leave if that employee does  return to work at the end of his or her absence from the work force.
. as we k. two evenings ago in what i think was a very dramatic step by this senate. we passed a provision dealing with health care. and in that provision was a section which the distinguished chairman of the finance committee drafted and which we supported. i supported and everybody else supported. dealing with the deductibility of health insurance by the selfemployed. the trouble was in that we had a very limited amount of money. so it was a limited time that the 100 percent deductibility applied. what this proposed amendment does is to take some money we do have available and to extend the period for the deductibility of 100 percent of the insurance for the selfemployed. this is  going to solve everybodys problems. but it is a big step forward. currently. the selfemployed can only deduct 25 percent of their health insurance. this makes it 100 percent for a period. i am  sure. how long is the period.
. on the last amendment that we passed.  3182. i ask that the distinguished senator from pennsylvania who has long been interested in these health care matters. particularly the deductibility for the selfemployed. be added as a cosponsor along with senators warner. grassley. pressler. packwood. the senator from pennsylvania. senator specter. and the others.
. as the senator ks. for 18 years individual health care providers in these clinics were allowed to answer in a direct way a question that is posed by a woman. that went on very peacefully and in splendid fashion for 18 years. why the change. what is the difference if there are all these omis overtones of abortion here. yet a doctor can answer the question but a registered nurse can.
i thank my colleagues for their assistance. and commend them for developing legislation which will significantly improve our understanding of the health of the coastal marine environment. i would also like to add that the epa environmental research laboratory in narragansett. ri is already conducting the nearcoastal activities under epas environmental monitoring and assessment program. and is working closely with a in implementing its status and trends program. this facility is ideally suited to serving as a headquarters for the monitoring activities authorized in this legislation. again. i thank my colleagues.
. but let me explain what was attempted to be achieved. there are those in the senate who believe very strongly and i am among them that something should be done to assist the states in getting discounts for those drugs that a state purchases for medicaid recipients. and so the idea was conceived that medicaid would be entitled to the best price or lowest price that the drug companies were willing to sell to anybodythis provision has had a detrimental effect on other purchasers. let me give you an example. at that time. the drug companies were giving discounts to the veterans administration and other profit purchasers. in some instances. that price was 20 percent of what the drug companies were selling drugs to medicaid or other entities for. and this came about because of a historic reason. the veterans administration represents a very small proportion of the total sales of the drug companies. during the war. or shortly after. as a favor in order to help the veterans administration. many allof the drug companies agreed on a very low price. in effect. this is when they sold to the veterans administration in bulk. and that is one of the reasons they could give the low price. so when we went to conference in 1990. those who were supported providing that same price said this is a good way of reducing medicaid costs to the states. but some of us said. well. if you require that your lowest price be given to medicaid. the companies longer will give the deep discounts to the veterans administration. and it is clear they would . if the veterans administration represents 1 percent of the sales of a drug company. and medicaid represents 14 percentor 12 to 14 percent--of their total sales. it is clear that the drug companies would say. well. forget it. we will  sell at that low price anymore to the veterans administration. at the depot price. that was very clear.
. h.r. family in america. 6167 also contains a provision that will recently. tom wyss. a state senator extend the moratorium on clean water from fort wayne. in. a personal friend act permit requirements for the of mine. informed me of his wifes bout stormwater discharges of small cities with cancer. toms wife. shirley. had a for aher 2 years. mammography screening showing in a series of decisions stretching signs of irregularity in january. in back over several years. the courts july. she was diaged with breast have found that the clean water act cancer. tom and several members of requires cities to obtain permits for the indiana breast cancer coalition the stormwater that they discharge have explained how this story is repfrom pipes and ditches to surface wa- resentative of many others. this shows
. we should and indeed will have health care reform in our country. but. at the same time. it- behooves all of us to be very. very candid with our constituents and to remind those constituents that this is  going to be easy. that some will have their premiums increased. that there will indeed be coverage for everyone after awhile. but that some regulation is going to have to come into the lives of our constituents who are currently enjoying fee for service type of medical care where they can go to any doctor they want to. any hospital they want to. that. to a great extent. will longer be possible. i thank the chair and i thank my distinguished friend from utah.
. we in congress are strugglingto figure out how to slow the skyrocketing cost of health care in this country. soaring health care costs are sapping our businesses. driving up the deficit. and leaving millions of americans without access to needed services. unfortunately. while we all agree -that something must be done about this problem. there is little agreement as to what that something is. one principle on which there is widespread agreement. however. is that if we are to arrest the growth in health care spending. we need to place far greater emphasis on promoting good health and less on treating bad health. it is in this spirit that i join as a cosponsor of s. 88. nutrition experts agree that diet and health go hand in hand. according to the surgeon generals 1988 report on nutrition and health. the chief dietary problem among americans today is the overconsumption of foods that are high in fat. high fat diets contribute substantally to a greater incidence of heart disease. high blood pressure. stroke. and obesity. and in turn. to our nations ever increasing health care expenditures. it is also widely ackledged that the dietary habits we develop as children tend to shape our adult eating patterns. thus. children with high fat diets are likely to become adults with high fat diets. conversely. children with healthful diets tend to continue those habits as adults. given all we k about the link between nutrition and health. one would think that our national school lunch program. which serves 25 million students. would make every effort to help children develop healthy habits to last a lifetime. ironically. under the national school lunch act. we currently require schools which participate in the federal school lunch program to offer whole milk as well as unflavored lowfat milk to studentsdespite the. fact that the dietary guidelines for americans. published jointly by usda and hhs. recommend that people over age 2 drink skim or lowfat milk. which contain significantly smaller amounts of fat. s. 88 would amend the national school lunch act to take the decision about what kind of milk to serve out of the hands of the federal government and place it where it belongs--in the hands of local school lunch professionals. under this legislation. school lunch programs would remain free to offer whole milk if they so desire. but longer would they be required to do so. granted. this is  a monumental change. but it is a common sense one. developing healthful eating habits among our citizens should be a primary component of our efforts to arrest the growth in health care costs. what better time to foster those habits than when our youngsters are in school. i congratulate my good friend senator lugar for introducing this legislation. and urge my colleagues to join as cosponsors..
we all agree these deficits are intolerable. even under the proposal submitted by president clinton. the debt of the nation increases by $1 trillion in 4 years. so we have  gotten a handle on this problem at all. second. we all agree that the entitlements are the principal driving force in our deficit. the opponents of this object. they object to the approach of the senator from georgia and the rest of us. they say it is  pertinent. but it is also a fact. . that the opponents have been opposed to all attempts to handle the entitlement problem that we face in this nation. we have had a whole series of votes on this matter. those who have voted against it have never once voted to do anything about the entitlements on this floor. so it seems to me we can keep going with the present intolerable situation. or we can try to do something about it. there is a lot of talk about health care reform. as though that is going to solve the problem. but the facts are that health care reform is going to cost money in the first years of its initiation. so i think this is a worthy t:y. i hope that my colleagues will aupuort it.
madam president. i wanted to ask the distinguished senator from pennsylvania a question or two in connection with his legislation. before i do that. i want to say that the senator from pennsylvania has been a very. very loyal and hardworking member of our health care task force reform group for the republican senators. he has worked on this matter for a long time and is deeply interested. there is one provision in his amendment i would like to draw out. if i understand it correctly. i believe that in the senators legislation he has a provision where a federal board sets caps on the rate of increase that the insurance company would be permitted on its premiums.
well. madam president. i am  in agreement with that particular provision. and while i will vote for the senators amendment. i recognize. one. that it is going to have difficulty passing here and. two. that should it pass here. it would undoubtedly have difficulty in the conference. etheless. i want to support the senators efforts because he has devoted a lot of time to health care generally and has been supportive of our overall republican efforts in the republican senatorial health care task force. on this particular provision. i am  in agreement. so i do  want somebody coming to me later on down the roadand we all recognize health care is going to be with us quite a while--i do  want anybody coming up to me and saying to me or saying to other members who might possibly vote on this: do  talk to us about being opposed to a board setting cape on premium increases. because you voted for that on april 27 in connection with the specter amendment. i think we will all discover. as we go along. in connection with health care. that we do  take a sworn pledge to be for everything that is in a particular piece of legislation. we recognize that. particularly in connection with this health care matter. it is going to go through innumerable iterations. i want to commend the senator for his consistent efforts. and while i have disagreements on this particular portion. and perhaps on other portions of the bill. i think that the senator is deserving of encouragement for his persistence and his genuine interest in this. we all k that regardless of what happens with this measure todayand i think we are all being candid. and we pretty well recognize it is  going to pass--he made a contribution to the debate and will proceed with that debate. when mrs. clintons task force comes forward with their proposals. which i am sure will be thoughtful and wise in many respects. we will take those up and discuss those at that time.
that is the way i read it. and one will accuse the senator from utah of favoring bureaucrats. he is a strict governmentalist. and rightfully so. but it seems to me this is what has happened. just follow through with my illustration. let us say that the bureaucrats decide. well. we will write those regulations for cfcs. and then we go on and 2 years from  we pass aher one that might be dealing with hospital waste washing up on beaches or something. we are going to control that. and that is going to require regulations. they might go back and repeal the regulations dealing with the cfcs. so some unkn down there suddenly eliminates a law we have on the books. i do  get it.
. today i am introducing the medicare mental health improvement act. this legislation will assure that medicare beneficiaries who reside in nursing homes will get needed mental health care. problems with untreated. or inappropriately treated. mental illnesses and behavioral problems are far too common in our nursing homes today. due to inequities in medicare payment for mental health treatment. patients who reside in nursing homes have limited access to psychiatric and psychological services. all too often. when nursing home residents need mental health counseling and treatment. the common response of the attending physician is to prescribe psychoactive drugs. these medications often have unpleasant side effects such as leaving patients confused and causing them to lose their sense of balance. as a result. patients often fall and must be treated for serious physical injuries. how can we improve access to these services. under current law. medicare treats physicians services to nursing home patients as outpatient care. while most medicare outpatient services require patients to pay for 20 percent of the charge. patients must pay for 50 percent of outpatient mental health services. for many medicare patients. particularly those who live in nursing homes. this requirement is a major financial burden that worsens if they need followup treatment. for others. who may have serious mental illness. the copayment is uncollectible. and further discourages providers from treating nursing home residents.the legislation that i introduce today would simply bring medicare payments for outpatient mental health services for nursing home residents in line with reimbursement for other types of outpatient services. under my proposal. copayments for mental health services for nursing home residents would be reduced from 50 to 20 percent. specialized consultation and treatment for mental illnesses has been proven to help. dramatically. patients who suffer from depression. and illness affecting one in three nursing home residents. this treatment can minimize the need for patient restraints and psychoactive drugs. benefits of this treatment include more precise diagis. careful review of drug regimens. and better identification and treatment of depression. patients will bentefit from careful consideration of drug options for treatment. training for nursing home staff on how to better handle behavioral disturbances. and assistance to families to better understand the problem and assist in decisionmaking. one may also see resulting costsavings for the federal government through decreased hospital admissions resulting from the use of inappropriate drugs. in short. the treatment can result in better quality of life and wellbeing for nursing home patients. staff. and their families. i urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record immediately following my remarks.
. many of us in this congress and especially the senate are wrestling with the problems of health care reform. we have all discovered it is an extremely difficult subject. as we all k. mrs. clinton and her task force are also working on this. i commend mrs. clinton for what she is doing. because this is a problem that deserves the careful attention of all of us. mrs. clinton has certainly thrown herself into this problem with vigor and intensity. devoting tremendous amounts of time to it. i think we all recognize that if we are going to cover everyone in our society who is currently  covered. it is going to take increased costs. we hear different estimates of what those costs might be. sometimes the suggestion is between $60 billion or perhaps $90 billion a year. some of these costs. or potential costs. are going to be offset by changes that we will make in the system. for example. there will be a greater accent in any program on managed care. we will have administrative improvements to reduce the high costs that are  associated with the administration of these complicated health care programs. certainly there will be medical liability reform. there will be group purchasing. smallgroup purchasing. insurance market reform. a whole series of steps that will be taken. but. regardless of these. i think we all recognize there will be a requirement for net new additional dollars. . . how to raise it. today there is an indication on the front page of the washington post that the administration is suggesting one of two approaches: one being a payroll tax of some percentage. 7 percent possiblyaher being what is kn amongst those who study this subject as an employer mandate. in other words. the employer would be required to cover x percentage of the insurance premium levied upon the individual employee for coverage.  it seems to me we ought to recognize that an employer mandate. saying that an employer must cover 80 percent. perhaps. or whatever it is. of the premium is different from a tax. an employer mandate is indeed a tax. regardless of how it is termed. speaking on behalf of the republican senators who spent a lot of time on this subject. we have deep reservations that this is the -way to go. we believe that the effect of an employer mandate is going to be extremely severe on small businesses. and. in fairness to mr. clinton and her group. in our conversations with her. she is aware of this. but i think it is safe to say. that the approach of the republicans will  be for the employer mandate. this has all kinds of ramifications. especially. as i mentioned before. on our small businesses. it will have an extremely serious effect upon them. so. regardless of whether it is termed a payroll tax. as one approachand. indeed. if you follow the payroll tax. you end up with a singlepayer system. but setting that aside. the employer mandate. we believe. is  the correct way to go. we look f6rward to continuing our deliberations on this and presenting a plan. and then we look forward to working with the administration. with what mrs. clinton and her group produces. because we recognize they have worked long and hard on this subject. have some very good ideas. and it is worthwhile that we consider what they do. and. hopefully. they will consider what we do likewise. i wish to thank my distinguished friends who have worked with me on this. senator specter has been a leader in. this whole area of health care reform. presenting legislation. senator cohen. who previously spoke. has also been deeply involved. as have many other senators. but these two are certainly among the leaders of the effort.
. we can ensure the public health and safety of our citizens unless we move to get rid of these lethal and all too accessible handguns. hence. my legislation. i will say this to all within hearing shot: if we do  act. sooner or later every american family will be touched by handgun violence. so i urge my colleagues to join me in support of s. 892. the public health and safety act. i thank the chair.
. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of s. 892. the public health and safety act. why do we call it the public health and safety act. we are wrestling with doing something about health care costs in this country. we see the escalating costs. over $4 billion a year is spent by the taxpayers to care for those who have hospital or doctor costs as a result of the prevalence of handguns and injuries resulting from handguns--s4 billion a year. so that is the health side of it. if we are serious about doing something about our health bills. we will step up to the mark in this situation and ban these handguns. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of s. 892. the public health and safety act. i thank the chair. and i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. it would bode well for the future. we have some big issues coming up that are going to require cooperation. whether you are talking the th american freetrade agreement. or you are talking the health care reform. it is my belief that america will benefit if both sides can get together and we can have a bipartisan approach to these very difficult problems. i want to thank the chair. and i want to thank the members on the other side for giving me this time.
. it seems to me that the amendment put forth by the senator from illis simply makes common sense. it seems clear that all should agree that $10 is a ridiculously. ludicrously low fee for a federal firearms license. there are very. very fewif any--other licenses that cost so low. and when one considers that we are talking about a license for dealing in gunsby any definition. deadly weaponsthe low fee seems  only ridiculous. but downright foolhardy. the amendment proposed would raise that fee from $10 to 375. i do  consider that $375 is an exorbitant amount. especially considering that a dealing with any profit margin at all could cover that fee without much difficulty. and quite frankly. when you consider that we are talking about a lethal productguns. weapons that are wreaking havoc on our societyi find the sum of 375 actually quite outrageously small for a virtually unlimited right to buy as many guns as you like and distribute them freely. this amendment does  merit a lengthy discussion of the socalled second amendment right to bear armswhich is an utter canard. by the way. it has hing to do with whether citizens can go trap or skeet shooting. it has to do with commonsense rules about how easily one should be able to purchase the ability to buy unlimited quantities of guns. all this amendment is. is a small step toward sanity. it will  stop all handgun violencebut it will help slow down and close off yet aher of our unbelievably. easy routes of access to deadly guns. . as my colleagues k. i believe we should close off access to handguns entirely. simply turn off the spigot that pours more than 2 million handguns into circulation each year by banning handguns altogether. in my view. that is the real waythe only wayto tackle the problem of handgun violence. i would like to see the senate ...s9921 debate my public health and safety act of 1993. a bill to ban the sale. manufacture. and possession of handguns. i would welcome that. but that is  what this debate today is about. what the senator from illis is asking for. in fact. hardly merits debate. it should -be approved unanimously. what is the fuss about. in sum. i believe the senator from illis has an amendment that makes eminent sense. i congratulate him on this proposal and am pleased to be a cosponsor of his amendment.
 clintons choice of dr. elders and believe she will serve us well as the nations chief public health advocate. if confirmed by the senate. i believe dr. elders will be a vigorous. highprofile surgeon general in the mold of dr. everett koop. i have faith that dr. eldersa frank and independent personwill  shy away from the difficult public health challenges and issues confronting our nation. to the contrary. she has the energy and wherewithal to advance responsible and sensible public health policies for this country. she has had a distinguished career in public service and in medicine as director of the arkansas department of health and as a pediatric endocriogist. her strong advocacy for womens and childrens health issues. in particular. demonstrates a sense of priority and sensitivity with which i strongly identify. her commitment to increasing child immunization rates and emphasizing primary care in arkansas are just a few of the ways in which she has distinguished her leadership abilities. dr. elders enjoys broad support within the public health community. including that of dr. barbara debuo director of the rhode island department of health. whose views i greatly respect and admire. the recipient of an hoary degree from yale university. dr. elders has won endorsements from numerous national organizations. including the american heart association. the american cancer society. the american medical association. the society for pediatric research. the american pediatric society. the national association for public health policy. and the national association of childrens hospitals. i am pleased the senate labor and human resources committee today favorably reported dr. elders ination by a vote of 13 to 4. while some of my colleagues may continue to have philosophical differences with the inee. it is my hope we can proceed to debate and vote on the elders ination before the august recess. at that time. i urge my colleagues to vote "yes" to confirm dr. elders. she has a wealth of experience. and the toughmindedness to effectively advocate the public health interests of all our citizens.
madam president. the amendment being offered by senator lautenberg has a simple purpose: it requires federal agencies. as well as agencies of the judicial and legislative branches. to adopt a smoking policy based on guidelines issued by the environmental protection agency. such a policy will help to protect government workers from the debilitating and potentially fatal effects of secondhand tobacco smoke. it will also put the government in the position of setting the right example by taking the lead to protect the health and safety of its employees. why is it so important for government agencies to take measures to eliminate tobacco smoke from their buildings. the answer is that recent reports from both the environmental protection agency and the american heart association have provided unequivocal evidence that secondhand tobacco smoke is harmful to our health. these reports label tobacco smoke "a kn carcien." which poses an unacceptably high risk of respiratory and heart disease. the epa report. which adds to similar warnings already sounded by the national research council and the surgeon general. also links secondhand tobacco smoke to pneumonia. bronchitis. and reduced lung function and labels it a kn cause of middle earinfections. anyone who still argues that secondhand tobacco smoke does  pose a serious health risk simply does  want to be confused by the facts. this amendment is a modest but laudable step toward providing a healthy workplace for our government employees. madam president. despite my strong support for the substance of the amendment of the senator from new jersey. i must register a e of concern. the process of legislating on an appropriations bill is one that troubles me. the proper place to address a substantive issue of policy is in the au-. thorizing committee. both the senator from new jersey and i sit on the committee on environment and public te - s10175 works--the committee with jurisdiction over the two issues covered by this amendment: indoor air pollution and the management of public buildings. so while i support the substance of the senator from new jerseys amendment. i can support this attempt to circumvent the authorizing committee. it is my firm intention to assure that in the future. all matters which fall within the jusridiction of the committee on environment and public works are considered by that committee. and are  dealt with on appropriations bills.
. that leads me to the troubling issue of aids prevention. just yesterday i read an extremely alarming article in the washington post about the spread of aids among young women. the gist of the article was that heterosexual transmission has ndw repaced iv drug use am the  1 cause of the alarming increase in aids among sexually active young women. th. article featured new. very disturbing reports from the world health organization and the centers for disease control on this tragic problem. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the racord at the conclusion of my statemen.
. although these and other more technical provisions are  issues which will receive national attention. it is critical that we make these adjustments in the medicaid program in order to improve the delivery of services and to provide relief for the states which struggle to administer this program. i urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be printed in the record
. on march 5. here in the senate. i spoke in favor of dr. joycelyn elders speedy confirmation as surgeon general of the united states. today. i come back to the senate to speak against for that same purpose. following careful review of dr. elders accomplished career as a physician. as a teacher. and as a director of the department of public health in arkansas. i am persuaded that she has the experience and the determination and the forthrightness to handle this difficult and increasingly important job. i view the position of surgeon general to be sort of chief advocate for the public health of the nation and all of us--many. at leastlook back on dr. everett koop as being the model who so effectively championed the role of chief advocate for public health. given the burgeoning public health problems our country faces today: teenage pregnancy. the scourge of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. the problems with substance abuse. the unique problems. of the lderlyour surgeon general must have more than the requisite medical and professional credentials. yes. we want that individual to be a doctor. yes. we. want him or her to have some experience. but it seems to me that the individual must be a tireless advocate and a coalition builder. capable of speaking with candor and with credibility to the american people. and. in addition. that individual has to somehow have the forcefulness to rise above the political fray here in washington to do what is necessary to protect public health. i believe dr. elders possesses all of these needed qualities. while serving as director of public health in arkansas. dr. elders successfully advanced a comprehensive agenda of public healthaprotecton. what were some of the things she did. it was really a remarkable achievement. i believe. she had an aggressive childhood immunization program that boosted the immunization rates among 2yearolds from 34 to 60 percent. nearly doubled the number of youngsters who were properly immunized in arkansas. she had an intensive campaign to increase early childhood health screening. certainly something we want for our nation. she did it in arkansas. covering more than 46.000 youngsters by 1992. she expanded the cancer detection services program for women. including nmanmograms and pap smears for cervica cancer screening. she had effective community health projects to promote smoking cessation. for example. and to promote healthy eating habits. and exercise to combat heart and lung disease. finally. she established a pioneering schoolbased clinic program where children. with parental consent. could receive screenings and other locally determined medical services. in addition to all these she launched a highly effective campaign against teen pregnancy in arkansas. and she did this with a local television station which won the george peabody and edward r. murrow awards. these are the two top awards for public service stations. this effort has helped keep the arkansas teen pregnancy rate down below the national average. dr. elders has my respect for the job she has done in her home state. and i am confident she is going to bring the same kind of commitment to the job of surgeon general of the united states. here on the floor of the senate and in the committee we have examined every aspect of her career in what i might say is excruciating detail. all the issues have been raised and have been examined during this exhaustive confirmation process. and that is good. but  it seems to me it is time for us to vote. and i urge my colleagues to vote "yes." and to give dr. elders the opportunity to assume this important position as soon as possible. i thank the manager of the ination.
. i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by senator lutrenbn . the amendment. of which. i am a cosponsor. has a simple purpose: it is designed to protect children from the debilitating and potentially fatal effects of secondhand smoke. while they are participating in federally funded health care and day care as well as federal programs such as read start and wic. . the amendment is- straightforward.mandating any federallyfunded program which is. involved in providing direct services such as daycare. medical care or counseling to children under the age. of 16. to adopt a smoking. policy in. the facility where such services are provided. the policy. however. need  apply to portions of te faciw ity which are  mally occupied. bythe children. so long as such areas have a separate ventilation system. the ameadment does include a waiver procedure. a program can petition. for an exemption to the smoking rule by outlining in writing the extenuating circunmisances which make it diff1cult or impossible. to comply.. in swelh a situation. the. program must assure. that it. will adopt an alternative policy that will protect children from second hand smoke to the maximum extent possible. septembe:r. 28. 1993 s 12"8  why are we making such a ruckus about this. why are we saying to these program directors that you can continue to receive federal funding unless you have taken significant steps to protect children from secondhand smoke. the answer is that recent reports from both the environmental protection agency and the american heart association have provided unequivocal evidence that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to our health and especially to the health of our children. these reports label secondhand smoke "a kn carcien." which poses an unacceptably high risk of respiratory and heart disease. the epa report. which adds to similar warnings already sounded by the national research council and the surgeon general. zeros in specifically on the effects of cigarette smoke on children. the report concludes that the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke presents a serious and substantial public health risk. secondhand smoke  only aggravates up to one million existing cases of childhood asthma each year but increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. children are especially vulnerable to the effects of tobacco smoke. the amendment we are offering today is an attempt to shield them from this danger. if adopted. it will assure that young children. at least during the time they are participating in federally funded programs. will be safe from second hand smoke. the studies have been completed. it is time to take action. this is a modest * but concrete step toward providing protections for the group identified as being most susceptible to the effects of secondhand tobacco smoke: our children. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.
 of the rhode island visiting nurse association [vna). with vision and leadership. mrs. mackenzie has guided the rhode island vna through a period of tremendous growth and diversification. making the organization a home health care pioneer. both in rhode island and nationally. when mrs. mackenzie assumed her position in 1977. the rhode island vna served a total of 3.286 patients per year. today. vna nurses provide a wide array of high quality home care services and programs to more than 8.000 rhode islanders. mrs. mackenzaes career has been a distinguished one. she is a graduate of columbia university and harvard school of public health. in addition to the rhode island -vna. she has brought her talents to the university hospitals of cleveland. the rochester regional medical program. and the university of rhode island. she is a volunteer member of the faculty of brown universitys department of community medicine and is a highly respected member of the public health community. jane mackenzies experience. ability. and compassion have been an emous benefit to the vna and to thousands of rhode islanders. as she begins her retirement. we in the state wish her the very best and extend our heartfelt thanks for her many years of service.e
. health care reform will be the most significant change in our society in this half of the 20th century. bearing this in mind. i think it is terribly important that we proceed with care. indeed. with extraordinary care. and that we recognize our inability to precisely predict the future. we should take some steps and see what -happens and then take the next step. i would like to highlight just three aspects of the clinton plan i believe would take us down the wrong path and which should be rejected. i would start off by saying there is much in the clinton plan that we. the sponsors of the heart plan. agree with. there are some 16 points of commonality. but there are some major differences. and i would like to just touch on three of these this morning. first. the clinton plan writes a very highly detailed. uniform benefit package into law. that is the first thingvery. very highly detailed. second. the clinton plan expands universal coverage. coverage for everybody in america. at a very rapid pace without king the cost that this will entail. third. the clinton plan embarks on new entitlement programs. an entitlement program is a program in which there is limitation on the funding. anybody that is entitled to it gets it. regardless of whether there is money. regardless of the cost of it. the clinton plan embarks on new entitlement programs without. in my judgment. proper calculation of the potential costs. these are giving new benefits that currently do  exist. i think all of us would agree that health care quality and techogy will change dramatically over just the next 10 years. never mind over the next two decades. our struggle must be to ensure that we allow health plans to evolve over time and that we do  freeze them into perpetuity by writing overly detailed benefits into statute. as the clinton plan would do. to leave the design of the benefits package to the political process--indeed. the congress would create a package that is way more than the nation can afford. let me just give you a couple of illustrations. medicare benefits are a complicated mix of statutory language and regulation. but they are very specific. in fact. they are so specific that almost every year sinc 1984 we have the incongruous situation of a senatorin this instance. it has been me. and a representative. representative pete stark. and some others. ending up in a room in this capitol at 2:45 in the morning to consider highly specific benefit provisions -under the medicare program. and. indeed. i clearly remember one time at 2.45 am.. congressman pets
this draft billhere it is--this draft bill has 58 pages devoted to what is to be in the uniform benefit package. here it is: outpatient prescription drugs and biologicals described in section 1122. outpatient rehabilitation services described in section 1123. 58 detailed pages of what is to be in the uniform benefit package. . you k and i k when this bill comes to the floor of the senate in this form. senators will be popping up all over the floor making sure that their little group is taken care of that they are concerned about. whether it is chiropractors or podiatrists. if they are  already written into this bill. they will be. and when congress is through. it will be the most expensive benefit package kn to man. that is our concern. this is the ultimate form of congressional mioromanagement and it should be avoided. under our plan we provide only mini.mal guidance to the national benefits commission comprised of experts who then develop and refine a uniform benefit package. taking into account the costs to the nation. is congress involved. yes. congress is involved. but under our plan congress can only vote up or downjust as we do in the base closure process . we can samy we want it or we do  want it. but we will  have the power to amend it. and that is very. very imporiant. keep congress from amending the package or we all k it will be so large that the nation will  be able to afford it. our guidance to the commission under the senate republicans plan is to ensure basic coverage with an emphasis on preventive care. beyond that. we leave it up to the commission. as to universal coverage. i will just say we all seek that goal. under the republican plan we first cover those at 90 percent of poverty and see if the savings that we have set forth indeed do create the. savings that we think should be there. if so. then we expand the coverage to those at 100 percent of poverty and below. and thus work our way upward until eventually we get to 240 percent of poverty. we do  cover the entire premium at that level. only a portion. on a sliding scale. but it is a payasyousave proposal. while i was relieved to see the clinton draft bill establish a more realistic timetable for achieving universal coverage than the original outline--the plan still falls to tie the extension of coverage to actual savings. instead. it relies upon an unspecified ceiling to prevent the subsidies from becoming an openended obligation for the federal government. if. and when. the ceiling is breached. congress would be called upon to either cut the program or identify new funding sourcesa decision most of us could predict today. thus. the proposal amounts to an emous new liability--one that we have earthly way of estimating. finally. i want to speak to the issue of creating new entitlements in health care reform legislation. the growth in the medicare and medicaid programs. two of our most significant entitlements. is one of the most compelling reasons to reform our health care system. despite our best efforts to control the cost of these programs over the past decade. both have grown by 10 to 15 percent annually. we have to be very careful about adding new openended spending programs. by their own estimates. the administration says adding the prescription drug benefit to medicare will cost $66 billion over 6 years. enhancing longterm care benefits. they estimate. will cost $65 billion over that same period. the federal government paying 80 percent of the retiree health premiums for many citizens who retire at age 55an obligation mally borne by private industryis aher extremely costly obligation we can afford. in closing. let me make one final observation. as a member of the finance committee who has been involved for many years in efforts to hold down the rate of increase in federal health expenditures. the estimates we based our decisions on were always wrong--sometimes exponentially wrong. and i predict the assumptions we base our health care reform decisions upon over the next year will prove wrong. too. thats why we must proceed with caution. let us find what works and what doesnt work. we can achieve coverage of all americans. let us do it right.
madam president. i wish to express my strong support for the freedom of access to clinic entrances act. which has been reported by the committee on labor and human resources. it is interesting to e that this came out of that committee on a bipartisan vote. in other words. while there were four republicans who voted against it. there were three republicans who voted for it in the committee. in my view. this bipartisan compromise does a careful job of balancing the right to peaceful protest with a womans right to reproductive health services. the house. as i understand it. is also taking up the legislation this week. so the chances are good that we can put a bill on the presidents desk in rather short order. the amendment by the senator from new hampshire. as i understand it. would reduce the penalties. it seems to me that the second offense penalty suggested by the senator from new hampshire appears to be very mild. it goes to a maximum of 60 days as opposed to the length of time that is provided within the legislation. s. 636 would make it a federal offense to impede access to abortionrelated services. including pregnancy counseling services. it would also make the damage or destruction of property of such facilities a federal crime. moreover. s. 636 would enable victims of clinic violence to seek injunctive relief in civil damages. these are very. very important steps. to confront the escalating tide of violence around the country. thebill also gives the attorney general and the state attorneys general critical enforcement roles through our federal and state courts. madam president. this issue is  about a womens right to choose or about free speech. indeed. some of the bills very supporters count themselves among the prolife movement. this issue is about violence. it is about destruction of property. it is about intimidation. and it is about terrorism. and. indeed. it is even about murder. should we wait for more inent victims to join dr. gunn. the florida physician who was shot to death this past march. or are we prepared to say. "egh is egh". . i would like to bring to the attention of the senate those tactics that have been used in my home state of rhode island against planned parenthood and its staff just over the past 12 months. in december. the medical. director began receiving subscriptions to magazines and other unwanted publications. in january. the medical directors. face appeared on a wanted poster that was sent to his office and home. "wanted for murder" and the medical directors face appeared on it. in march. the clinic was blockaded twice by activists. and the directors driveway was mined with nails which blew out four tires and caused his wife an injury. in april. a clinic employee was intimidated at a restaurant by two men who began yelling that she was a murderer. and had blood on her hands for murdering babies. that same woman was also followed in her car by aher car on two occasions. . in april. the clinic was splashed with red xerox toner and had to be repaintedonly to face aher assault with green fluorescent paint. in may. the clinic was picketed every day. and staff were identified by name by the picketers and told their homes would also be picketed. the clinic ultimately went to court. and. a restraining order was granted to one of its employees to stop two individuals from talking to. following. or approaching her. the order was later violated by one of those individuals. here is the interesting fact and why i think we need federal legislation. both of the men covered under the restraining order have been arrested in texas. ohio. new york. the district of columbia. wisconsin. georgia. and arizona. in other words. this is a calculated conspiracy. both of the men covered under the restraining order that was granted in rhode island had been arrested in texas. ohio. new york. the district of columbia. wisconsin. georgia. and arizona. ind they had also served time in th dakota and th carolina. from 1977 to april of this year. more than 1.000 acts of violence have been committed against reproductive health services personnel in the united states. these acts include some 36 bombings. 81 arsons. 131 death threats. 84 assaults. 2 kidnappings. 327 clinic invasions and 1 murder. and people say we do  need to take some action. aher 6.000 blockades and other disruptions were reported over that same period. madam president. these are  the tactics of passive resistance. they are the acts of emboldened extremists who believe society will continue to tolerate their illegal behavior under an ambiguous mantle of free speech. i say. "egh is egh." it is time for us to draw the line. and restore needed balance by passing s. 636. and by rejecting the amendments that will be offered to this bill.
. this is one step on the long march to improve the health of american women in this decade and beyond into the 21st century. the health care needs of half of our population must  be overlooked. i urge my colleagues to cosponsor this sense of the senate resolution.
. 100 years ago the young womens christian association founded a committeetravelers aidto assist and protect young women moving to providence. ri. today. i am pleased to annce the centennial anniversary of the travelers aid society of rhode island. and i wish to thank its members for their tremendous contributions to our state. while the staff and scope of travelers aid has greatly expanded since 1894. its dedication to service remains un.changed. today. a skilled and largely volunteer staff provide a wide range of educational and medical services to rhode islanders in need. in addition. the travelers aid society maintains an aggressive outreach program designed to help atrisk individuals. including the homeless. three of the travelers aid programs are especially eworthy: first is the travelers aid adult education program. it. offers language. general education diploma (ged]. and english as a second language (esl] courses. in addition to other classes where students are taught basic skills to locate and maintain employment. some of these classes are taught by ms. sally gabb. the recipient of the 1993 rhode island adult educator of the year award and director of the travelers aid adult education program. second is the mobile medical van program. since 1987. the travelers aid society of rhode island has made basic medical services available through its mobile medical van. for the. past 7 years. the volunteer staff has aided more than 10.000 rhode islanders. those seeking assistance are the homeless. the unemployed. and those who are working but have neither medical insurance  the means to see a doctor. patients range from children to senior citizens. and can be seen by appointment or on a walk in basis. the third program is called the travelers aid project street [taps]. where many graduates of travelers aid return to show and share their success storiesthey do for others what travelers aid has done for them. for example. -mr. lemoyne waite. who was once in and out of several travelers aid clinics.  walks the streets of providence informing men and women about the many services available to them at travelers aid. in conclusion. i ask my colleagues to join me in wishing travelers aid of rhode island a happy 100th annivdrsary. and praising this wonderful organization for a century of public service.9
. i want to make one other point with respect to current law. when setting the_ health goal under the current actthe maximum contaminant level goalthe administrator is to establish a goal at the level at which kn or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety. that is the statutory language from the safe drinking water act. in using this authority the administrator has usually included a 10fold margin of safety when setting the health goal to reflect the natural variability in the susceptibility to adverse health effects among the general population. this safety factor is in addition to other safety factors that may reflect the use of data from animal experiments or for other reasons. the consideration of sensitive subpopulations as provided in the senators amendment is  intended to replace this traditional margin of safe- ty for variability in the general population. recent studies by the national academy of sciences and others indicate that some subpopulations may be 100fold or 1000fold more sensitive to some contaminants. this amendment would assure more careful review of these sensitivities without eliminating the existing margin of safety for human variability that is kn to exist in the general population.
madam president. this amendment asks the epa to investigate the health risks associated with leaking oil and pcbs from submersible pumps. and identify those pumps which are most likely to fail. the epa- is then instructed to produce a report to be provided to the public discussing the health risks. listing those pumps which may fail. and advising the public on measures to be taken to avoid these health risks. private well owners- deserve safe. potable water. this amendment will allow us to educate and protect those private wellowners whose wells contain pumps that risk leaking.
madam president. in the words of the famous american philosopher yogi berra i feel like this is "deja vu all over again." the question before us is. is this a killer amendment. let us review the bidding. last april 29. while the senate was considering the epa cabinet billthat was the bill to make the head of the epa a member of the presidents cabinetthe senator. from louisiana presented an amendment on risk assessments and costbenefit analysis very similar to this amendment that we are considering here today. the senator argued forcefully. and i might say persuasively. as he can. few people can exceed the persuasive powers of the senior senator from louisiana. his point was that epa promulgates too many regulations without giving adeqate consideration to the costs being imposed on the regulated community. he argued that the epa regulations are frequently designed to address risks that in his and others judgments sometimes are too small to be addressed..  after negotiating with the administration officials and some of the leading environmental leaders in the senate. the senator modified his amendment and we were assured that the amendment.-.as modified. was  opposed by the administration and seemed to be acceptable to everyone. including those of us who care deeply about epa and its ability to carry out its mission. based on that and the persuasive powers of the senator. 95 senators came to the floor and approved it and only 3 senators voted against it. that is a pretty good margin any day around here. what happened after that. well. people had a chance -to more thoroughly consider the amendment. they realized it was  entirely a benigii amendment. and it ran into significant opposition. as the senator from louisiana has said. in the house of representatives. and the environmental leaders in the house fought back efforts in the committee to add the amendment to the house version of the epa cabinet bill. the environmental leaders also convinced the rules committee that the amendment was  germane and obtained a rule that would have precluded any attempt to bring the johnston amendment up as an amendment on the floor. as was pointed out. the rule was defeated on the floor. which. does  happen very often. what happened then. well. the environmental leadership. of the. house pulled the bill. the epa cabinet bill is dead. and it is dead because that amendment is- on it. the environmental leaders in the housesaid we are  going to bring that bill. up. if that is the price of bringing the epa cabinet bill to- have the- risk assessment amendment of the senator from louisiana on it. the point i am making here today is. we have a good bill before us and it has a lot ofsupport. i am talking about the safe drinking water bill. but i believe that if this amendment is adopted and we start down the path. that was followed in the house of representatives. .we are  going to see this safe drinking water bill emerge. i am  just. conjuring this. i am  just dreaming it up. we have seen what has happened and there is the experience. it is. exactly what happened with the cabinet bill. so. madam president. i think that is. one very good reason . to accept this. .. let. me give you aher reason that i believe that this amendment is  proper at this time. it is  necessary. one is going to stand here and say that risk assessment is  a useful tool. it is. it is. important for everyone to recognize that this amendment is  about some- being for or some being against the use of risk assessment. epa already is required to use risk assessment. and does. it extensively. so risk assessment is hing. new since 1981 it has been the basis for countless public policy decisions dealing with the regulation of chemicals in our environment. indeed.. madam president. there is ah executive order from this president. president clinton. that continues this tradition of risk assessment and requires epa to use this important tool when making decisions. when the senator first presented his amendment in april of last year. after that and in response to the senators concerns the following. septemberin other words. the amendment was presented the last. part of aprilin september of last year. 1993.. president clinton issued an executive order. and that new executive order covers many of the points. addressed by the senators amendment. so- the questionl is. why do we need it. in my view. we do  need it. i do  think it will add anything good. and i do believe it will produce results that e of us can foresee and few of us will like. do. think that risk assessment is without controversy. there is plenty of controversy. and some. people say the assumptions that are undertaken when you make a risk assessment are conjured.. that they are dreamed up. who .ks. who can bring up all the assumptions that have to- go. into. a risk assessment. let me just give you a little illustration. of risk assessment gone haywire. take the example of dioximat the town of times beach in missouri. most of us here are familiar with that case. in 1983. 11 years ago. epa discovered that the town of times beach was contaminated with dioxin.. so they tracked it down. it turned out someone had- disposed contaminated oil and spread it over the dirt roads in the town ta control the dust. it seemed like a good ide& take a little oil.. waste oil. and spread it around and keep. the dust down. so they got rid of the oil and they got rid of the dust at the same time.. the provisions of the superfund required epa to take some action when dioxin was discovered. but the law did  mandate what. kind of standard you have for a cleanup. how do you clean up dioxin. the law did  say thatthe epa went- to the centers for disease control in atlanta and said. "give us a risk assessment here. figure out what the public health consequences are of this dioxin in this nice town of times beach." so they did that. they came up with a risk assessment. and based on the advice of the centers for disease- control--which every one of us here admires. we al have great respect for the centers for disease controlthey came up with a health risk assessment. it was so strong inpresenting the dangers. of dioxin that epa decided to evacuate the town of times beach and buy the whole town.  we have 2020 hindsight. we look back and everybody says that decision was an unnecessary overreaction. it wasridiculed. but there was a decision that came about by risk assessment. they weighed all the. things and took the assumption and took the conclusion that this dioxin is incredibly dangerous. what does risk assessment bode for the future. well. what about dioxin emissions from municipal incinerators. or what about the discharges of chlorine from our- rivers and lakes. what about the exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke. to those who want every epa decision based on a rigorous scientific risk assessment. i say. be. careful you be careful what you wish for you may get it. as i stated earlier. this amendment has hing to do with being for or against risk assessment it is the. extent to which you carry itand there are other things involved in all of this besides straight risk assessment. there are sociological situations.
. s. 729 represents a bold attempt to deal with one of the most vexing health issues for our young people. exposure to lead. i thank the chief sponsor of the bill. senator reid. for his work on this legislation. and i urge my colleagues to support the bill.
. the month of may is chronic fatigue dysfunction immune syndrome awareness month. in my home state of rhode island. gover bruce sundlun has declared the week of may 9 to 13 chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome awareness week. i would like to bring to my colleagues attention this debilitating and mysterious illness. for which there is treatment or cure. and i wish to ho the women and men who have been fighting hard to shed light on this growing health threat. chronic fatigue immune dysfunction-. syndrome [cfids]/myalgic encephalomyelitis [me] is a disease of the immune system principally characterized by muscle and joint pain. headache. loss of memory. shortness of breath. respiratory symptoms. and incapacitating fatigue. according to the national cfids association. an estimated 1 to 2 million people are affected nationally. the rhode island chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome association. inc. [ri cfids] has been the primary advocate for cfids sufferers in my home state. this association has 150 members all who are k for their outstanding dedication and fortitude. founded by linda dooley. of coventry. ri. when she was diaged with cfids in 1987. this association has established support groups for both adults and children. and organized semtnars to teach doctors about cfids/ me. the association is working in concert with similar organizations across the nation and around the world to -increase awareness about this growing health concern. may 12 has been designated by the cfids association of america as international chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome awareness day. on this day. the rhode island cfids association orkanized a rally to turn the spotlight on cfids. the 50 ri cfids members who attended received a gubernatorial proclamation declaring may 9 to 12 as cfids awareness week. i ask my colleagues to join me in praising the women and men who make up the cfdis associations throughout the nation.*
. it is my fervent hope that we do  let this great opportunity that we have here to do something significan t in connection with those points that i ticked off and the senator from nebraska previously ticked offdoing something about persons in cooperatives. doing something about preexisting conditions. reform of the insurance market. doing something about medical liability reform. and making certain that those who are individually selfemployed have full deductibility of their health insurance premiums. these and a whole series of other reforms should be enacted this year. i certainly hope we do  let this opportunity slip between our fingers. i thank the chair
. i would ask that the distinguished senator in his inquiries tomorrow bear in mind the biotech industry. and i particularly think of a small biotech company in my home city in my state. providence. ri. that company is a venture capital company. it is called psychotherapeutics. that company is seeking a cure for two major diseases affecting the elderly. alzheimers and hodgkins. i lhave been informed by that company. which so far has  produced a dollar of revenue. that they anticipate their total expenditures before they get any return will be $200 million. . $200 million for somebody in the federal government is  much. but $200 million for a providence. ri. company is a lot of money. they are raising that money through venture capital. selling stock. so i hope that when the inquiries are devoted to a company making too much money. charging what they think is a lot. they bear in mind this little company. which i hope succeeds. i hope they get a cure for alzheimers. i hope they do something for hodgkins. i hope whoever invests in that company will make a lot of money. i hope that company will be a splashing success. and i hope that the head .of that company. dr. seth rudnick. will be paid a handsome salary. i want them to succeed. -so my question is i hope that when the inquiries are made it is borne in mind that this company will  have a penny of return to anybody who invests in it until their total expenditures reach. in their judgment. $200 million. so i appreciate what the senator is doing.
. first. i want to congratulate the senator from minnesota. i share his sentiments. what are we trying to do here. the goal is to cover all of these services in the uniform benefit package that we are going to come up with. i do  think we want to be so specific that what is put into regulation then has to be changed in the following year. i suppose the proponent of the amendment would say that this is just for during the interim period. this will come out by july of 1995. but we all k that once we start down that track. once the secretary of hhs comes out with this very detailed scheduleand everybody is familiar with this. and i presume it has been read beforeshe shall establish a schedule of periodicity that reflectsand so forth and so on. this is just the path i do  think we want to go in. to me. it is reminiscent of medicare. in medicare we have every possible contingency covered by regulation. and it is chaotic. i have had a hand in all of that. i think i mentioned in the remarks i made the other evening that you find the bizarre situation of senator chafee and congressman pete stark. both in part of the conference on medicare at 2 a.m. in the morning deciding in some remote part of this capitol who will get paid for reading an ekg. i am totallyand i might speak for representative stark in the same mannerincompetent to do that. we were beyond our realm on that. that is  in our job description.
. i am pleased to join with senator durenberger today in introducing legislation to extend for 2 years the medicare select program. based on legislation which i introduced in 1990. medicare select is a demonstration project operating in 15 states with more than 400.000 participants. under this program. medicare beneficiaries have the option to purchase medicare supplemental insurance policies--often referred to as medigap policiesthrough managed care networks. the program has been a huge success. recent data show that medicare beneficiaries who purchase medicare select products pay premiums which are 10 to 37 percent less expensive than traditional medigap products. moreover. consumer satisfaction with these products is extremely high. of the top 15 medigap products ranked by consumer reports in its august 1994 issue. 8 were medicare select policies. unfortunately. under current law. medicare select carriers will have to halt enrollment on december 31. 1994. . almost all the major health care reform plans introduced during this session of congress included provisions to expand the medicare select program to all 50 states. unfortunately. health care reform is beginning to look like a long shot. therefore. at the very least. we should enact legislation which will allow the current 15 state demonstration project. which has been such a success. to continue. this bill will do. just that. and i urge my colleagues to support it.* by mr. johnston:
deserves great credit. i think all of us who are part of that coalition found it a very. very exciting undertaking. where everybody was working toward a common goal. we were trying to come up with health care legislation that could be accepted and passed this year. we appreciate the kind comments the manager of the bill made just  and also for her input. the distinguished senator from maryland joined with us on several odcasions and was of valuable assistance.
. i am pleased to join as a cosponsor of this amendmentto permanently extend the medicare select program. based on legislation which i introduced in 1990. medicare select is a demonstration project operating in 15 states with more than 400.000 participants. under this program. medicare beneficiaries have the option to purchase medicare supplemental insurance policiesotherwise kn as medgap policiesthrough hmo managed care networks. the program has been a huge success. recent data show that medicare bene-. ficiaries who purchase medicare select products pay premiums which are 10 to 37 percent less expensive than the premiums for traditional medigap products. moreover. consumer satisfaction with these products is extremely high. of the to 15 medigap products ranked by consumer reports in its august 1994 issue. 8 were medicare select policies. unfortunately. under current law. medicare select carriers will have to halt enrollment on december 31. 1994. almost all the major health care reform plans introduced during this session of congress included provisions to expand the medicare select program to all 50 states. as we all k . however. health care reform is  going to happen this year. therefore. at the very least. we should enact legislation which will allow the current 15 state demonstration project. which has been such a success. to continue. this amendment will do just that. and i urge my colleagues to support it.
. i am pleased today to join with senators feinstein. hutchison. kohl. and dorgan in introducing legislation to extend the medicare select program permanently and to make it available in all 50 states. based on legislation that i introduced in 1990. medicare select is a demonstration project operating in 15 states with more than 400.000 participants. under this program. medicare beneficiaries have the option to purchase medicare supplemental insurance policies--often referred to as medigap policies--through managed care networks. this program has been a huge success and admirably serves those beneficiaries lucky egh to participate. recent data continues to show that medicare beneficiaries who purchase medicare select products pay premiums 10 percent to 37 percent less expensive than traditional medigap products moreover. consumer satisfaction with these products is extremely high. of the top 15 medigap products ranked by consumer reports magazine in its august 1994 issue. eight were medicare select products. unfortunately. under current law. current medicare select carriers will have to halt enrollment in almost all the major health care reform plans introduced during the past session of congress included provisions to expand the medicare select program to all 50 states. while e of these health care reform efforts succeeded. my colleagues and i worked at the end of the last session to extend the demonstration program until july of this year. until we could introduce a bill to extend the program permanently and to expand it to all 50 states. as i indicated. the current demonstration program expires in july of this yearbefore w e will be a6lq to take any actions on health care reform. therefore. we need to enact legislation that will allow the current successful program to become a permanent option for medicare beneficiaries and to expand to all states. this bill will do just that. and i urge my colleagues to give it their support.*
. the committee on veterans affairs would like to request unanimous consent to hold a hearing on the reorganization of the veterans health administration. and the requirement of 38 u.s.c. 510(b) for the department of veterans affairs to provide 90 days ice to the congress before an administrative reorganization may take effect. the hearing will be held on may 11. 1995. at 10 a.m.. in room 418 of the russell senate office building.
for the information of all senators. the senate will resume consideration of the solid waste disposal act tomorrow. a cloture vote will occur on the committee substitute at 10 a.m. senators should be on ice that it is the hope of the leader to complete action on this bill on friday. also the leader may want to consider calendar  92. h.r. 483. the medicare select bill. therefore. votes will occur throughout fridays session of the senate.
. one of them i will describe. it is a rule promulgated under the safe drinking water act. it would reduce the levels of socalled disinfection byproducts in drinking water. these are the chemicals that form when water is chlorinated. as is done in most communities. it is chlorinated to kill bacteria and other organisms. the chlorine. in some instances. combines with other substances in the water to form new chemicals. such as chloroform. that may cause significant cancer risks for those using the water. a recent article in the american journal of public health indicated that up to 10.000 1.000. but 10.000--cases of cancer per year may be attributable to these chemicals in our water. epa has been working on a rule to reduce this health risk. s 6592 co did epa just conceive this rule as a bunch of bureaucrats sitting down at epa headquarters. this is what they did. they convened a regulatory negotiation involving all of the parties that had an interest. the drinking water suppliers. the states. the cities. public health organizationsa very broad group worked for 2 years on this rule. with one exception. this broad range of interests all signed an agreement at the end of the process supporting the proposed rule. the proposed rule reflects a significant consensus across virtually the entire community of interests involved in drinking water. . under the house proposal this would be targeted. it would .be suspended. you could  have the rule. you could  have the rule until some indefinite perioduntil certainly perhaps the end of this calendar year. and probably into the future likewise. why should they do that. i am opposed to that type of action by the house of representatives. a second item on the list is a petition that epa approved last december. it was a petition submitted by 13 states from the theast--my state involved likewiseasking that cars with pollution controls such as those used in california also be sold in the theast to reduce our air pollution problems. this was  an epa proposal. in fact. epa was reluctant to approve this petition. it was required by the clean air act because 13 states had made the request. i was under the impression that many of those who support these regulatory reform efforts want to return more responsibility -to the states. they say. "we believe in the states and states rights." here we have a proposal that was made by the states that is targeted on this house list as being suspended. . a third item on this list is the federal implementation plan for california that was promulgated in february. epa was ordered by the courts to produce this plan when california failed to come up with its own program. the epa program has been controversial in california and gover wilson has asked that it be suspended. and this list would target it for suspension. but this epa clean air plan for california has already been overturned. the supplemental appropriation for the defense department enacted earlier this year already repealed the california plan. including this item on this list of 30 rules to be killed must be an error. because congress has already acted to repeal this rule. i bring this item to the attention of the senate to make that point. where specific measures. including rules that are required by the courts because of laws enacted by the congress. go too far. we should take action to correct the excess. we have done that in several cases. we do  need an acrosstheboard moratorium. as mandated by the house in the
. i see the distinguished senator from west virginia in the chamber. i would be glad to pose him some questions if he is available to respond. as the chairman of our committee just pointed out. we are talking about medicare select. but what is medicare select. anyway. medicare select is the name of a type of medigap policy. it is something that seniors can buy to cover their medicare deductibles and copayments. medicare select is a type of medigap policy that permits managed care. that is. a managed care medigap policy. that is what it is. what was the problem in getting this plan started and why the restrictions. why could  the insurance companies offer medicare select if they wanted to. because when medigap legislation was originally passed in the house of representatives. there were some objections to medicare select. a representative from california did  believe in managed care. consequently seniors were  able to have these plans. well. finally. after patiently working at this several years ago in late evening sessions. we arranged that there would be 15 states that could try * this and see how it worked out. and so 15 states have done it. and as the chairman of our committee pointed out. it has worked very well. the trouble is that the option of these 15 states to offer this policy ends june 30. which is whata month and a half from . as the chairman pointed out. there is  a danger that we can extend medicare select because of having to deal with the budget. and so forth. and then all these people who have these medigap policies--and. indeed. it is a medigap policywill  be able to buy it or renew it. indeed. there is question about enrollments right : should a senior enroll in a medigap policy that has this managed care plan or should i . what happens if the plan is going to disappear. our point is  only should we extend medicare select but should we also make it permanent. but what about the rest of the states. why should  seniors in other states have this option. in my state. for example. why should  my citizens have the option of buying a medigap policy that is $25 to $27 less per month. depending on the situation. than they are paying for other medigap policies.
well. the senator from west virginia may wish to be assured. but i do  k how far we have to go. the national association of insurance commissioners supports the extension of this program. we just had the list of those who were supporting medicare select read by the chairman of our committee. you can go on and on and find reasons  to do something. but we are really in a very. very difficult situation here. this program expires in 30 days from  or 45 days from . it seems to me we ought to get on and extend it. and  only extend it but let the other states in on it. some mention was made about the consumers unions concerns about medicare select. but the fact of the matter is the consumers unions problems that were raised apply to all medigap policies.  focused in on medicare select.
. the senator says we have to wrestle with these problems. who says there is a problem. let me just touch on one matter that the senator raised. and that is the socalled attainedage rating. with a suggestion that medicare select. this type of managed care policy. medigap policy. has this attainedage rating. well. the fact is that the attainedage rating is permitted under current medigap law. it is  restricted. the attained age is  something peculiar to medicare select. that is permitted under the current medigap law. and so while it is true that most medigap policies and most medicare select policies do  use the attainedage method. i do  see why you focus in and say that is something peculiar to medigap or medicare select. because it is .
. i do  concede that there are all. these problems or that there are these problems. it seems to me what the senator from west virginia is doing is applying a higher standard to the medicare select. these managed care medigap policies. than he is to the regular medigap policies. i do  think that is fair. i do  think it is fair to say. " in medicare select. you can have attained age." whereas it is permitted in the other medigap policies. the suggestion here is that we ought to have hearings on this. well. i can speak for what the majority leader said. but all i do k is that the senate has passed a permanent extension of this proposal twice in the past 4 years. it was included in every major health reform proposal last year. including senator mitchells. senator doles and senator packwoods bill. and in the mainstream coalition bill. all of them had medicare select in them. so it is  that we are coming up against some unkn item here that we better be terribly cautious of. as i say. it has been out in these states. in 15 states. it is authorized. i can challenge the senators information when he says it is actually in practice. i believe he said. in 14 states. all i k is that i think it is a good option that is less expensive and that we ought to give all the citizens a chance at it. and the citizens from my state would like a chance at this. if they do  want to use it. that is their business. but if they have a right to choose a medigap policy that is less expensive than the current ones. i think they ought to have it and  be prevented. from doing so because this congress refuses to extend medicare select to all the states. again. one is more thoughtful and compassionate in this senate than the senator from west virginia. so i am  sure why he takes this particular position. because. as we mentioned before. this passed in the house 408 to 14. you could hardly get a motherhood resolution passed by that amount.
. our staff asked the health care financing administration [hcfa] for suggested changes. any problems. what do you think we ought to do. they did  have any. they had suggestions for us. maybe .the senator from west virginia can. find. what we can find. any documented quality problem with this program. . some beneficiary somewhere may object. i am sure they have. just like they have objected to a host of other medigap policies. but. as i say. this has received a favorable report by the consumers union
. the problem here isi k the senator is concerned about this--but the points he raises affect  medicare select but affect the whole medigaprange. in other words. when he says he is interested in open enrollment. there is open enrollment  in the medigap policies. he is saying he wants it for medicare select. but that means you want it presumably for all of medigap. . that is a very.big separate issue that can come up any time. you do  have to tag it on to a medicare select policy which. as i say. is just one of a whole series of medigap policies. if the senator wants to do that. that is changing the rules for the whole series of policies that are issued under medigap.
i will make one other point. if i might. and that is. as you recall. when i said my staff spoke to the health care financing administration. what i said was they asked for suggested changes and e came back. in the letter the senator quoted from secretary shalala. he mentioned somewhere in there concerns about expansion into the part b plan. we do  do that. there is expansion into that in this medicare select. so i will be glad to talk with the senator. if he would like. we can suggest the absence of a quorum and have a little chat here.
. i ask unanimous consent that the senate  turn to the consideration of calendar order  92. h.r. 483. regarding medicare select. and it be considered under the following time agreement: 10 minutes on the bill. to be equally divided between the chairman and ranking miity member of the finance committee. that one amendment be in order to be offered by senators packwood. chafee. rockefeller. and kennedy. on which there will be 10 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form. and that following the conclusion of time. that the amendmentnamely. the packwoodchafeerockefellerkennedy amendmentbe agreed to. and that the bill be read a third time and passed and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table all without any intervening action or debate.
. today i am introducing legislation which makes a technical correction to the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 [obra 90]. these changes would allow pregnant women and children enrolled in the medicaid program to continue receiving services from osteopathic physicians. the 1990 provisions were meant to prevent unqualified physicians from caring for medicaid patients. strict guidelines were enacted. requiring physicians working with these populations to be certified in family practice. pediatrics. or obstetrics. by the applicable medical specialty board recognized by the american board of medical specialties [abms]. while the 1990 budget legislation recognizes the importance of the abms in certifying physicians trained in allopathics. it does  recognize the authority of the american osteopathic association [aoa] in certifying osteopathic physicians. as one out of every four medicaid recipients receives health care from an osteopath. this policy only makes life more difficult for those on medicaid. it is important that we rectify this situation. osteopaths have been an integral and vital part of our nations medical community for over a century. this important change ensures that our health care system continues to grow more accessible and reliable for those who depend upon it. i urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. and look forward to working with them toward the bills enactment.* by mrs. feinstein:
. i would like to say to the senator from ohio that  only do i commend him for his efforts in connection with the speed limit. but i also would draw his attention to aher safety measure that will probably be attempted to be undermined here tomorrow. and that is the legislation we have which passed in 1991 in connection with the interstate transportation legislation fathered by the distinguished senator from new york. and that legislation encourages states to pass mandatory seatbelt laws and mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. every single senator on this floor. in connection with health. if asked: "are you for preventive medicine." would say. "yes. sure. certainly i am for preventive medicine." but if there ever was preventive medicine of a very dramatic type. it is the mandatory seatbelt laws and the mandatory helmets for motorcyclists. let us just take the motorcycle helmets. the correlation between the decline of deaths for motorcyclists and the passage of laws dealing with mandatory helmets absolutely exists. that correlation is there. example: california. california. i suppose. has more motorcyclists per capita than any state in the nation. and the california legislature. the general assembly in california three times had passed mandatory helmet laws. but the gover. prior to gover wilson. a republican. vetoed that legislation. and the veto was  overridden. gover wilson. then a senator here. sponsored or joined in sponsoring legislation mandating the use of helmets. mandatory helmet laws. he then was elected gover of california. and as gover of california. when that legislation mandating motorcycle helmets passed. gover wilson signed it. despite the fact that the motorcyclists. some 3.000 or 4.000 strong. circled the capitol in sacramento protesting. so again goverformer senatorwilson signed the legislation. . what has been the result. the result has been a decline in deaths of motorcyclists of 36.percent. from 1 year to the next. it followed the years following that legislation. that is extraordinary. there is reason it can be ascribed to other than that law. maryland is the same way. maryland passed the lawa 20 percent decline. and nearly all the populace states have passed that lawtexas. and florida. i regret that my state has  passed it. we are certainly  one of the more popular states.
. i hope very. very these provisions. we estimate that state much that it will be rejected. minimum drinking age laws. safety belt and ms. se. thank you.  that there are many other aspects to personal and social behavior that contribute far more to that cost of medicare than riding a motorcycle or driving an automobile.
well. . i do  think that is what it is all about. everybody can define the issue as they wish. but the real question is does the congress have any interest in the safety of its citizens riding its roads. and i believe we do. we have a deep interest. we have a deep interest because of the pain and suffering that arises but also because of the costs. the senator from maine is familiar with the letter that came from the eastern maine medical center. which .she herself received. it is a study of the medicaid costs that arise with those who are unbelted or with helmets. it is a very. very persuasive study that was done. what are we talking about when we are talking medicaid. we are talking federal dollars. and so for that reason alonenever mind the suffering that arises. i have seen it. i am sure the senators from colorado and maine have likewise visited their rehabilitation centers and seen individuals who were so severely damaged because of head injuries as a result of  having helmets. some who end up in comas. some who end up in terrible physical condition. these could have been avoided. i just can understand that we go backward. it is on the law . it is  resisting the presence of the law. the enactment of the law. it is repealoing the law. and yesterday. thank goodness. we rejected the effort to repeal the seatbelt requirement. and i hope we will reject this effort to repeal the motorcycle helmet effort.
. throughout the discussion yesterday on the amendment of the senator from new hampshire and the amendment today of the senator from maine. there was great accent on freedom. freedom to choosewe should respect the state legislatures in that they will do the right thing and that the federal government should get out of it. and the federal government was chastised in many of the remarks made here as a big. overpowering force. that we should do everything to avoid bringing the government closer to the people. that was the argument. all right. but the argument we were making on the other side was that the federal government has to pay the bill frequently through medicare and medicaid. in every instance in medicaid. the federal government is paying more than 50 percent. so that argument was blown away by a very. very heavy vote.  what we are saying is. ok. let the states decide. let the states forgo the socalled mandatory helmet bill. but if they do. then the federal government will  step in and pay the medical costs of an individual injured as a result of  wearing a helmet. so this is a very. very simple amendment. i should think it would thoroughly satisfy the states righters because they get everything they want. and indeed they are avoiding the problem of the big federal government coming in and paying some of the bills. if that presents a problem. so all we are saying is that where there is an injury attributable to that persons failure to wear a helmet. and the state does  have a helmet law. the federal government should  have to pay either medicare or medicaid. let the states pay it. i think it is a very fair deal.
. i won- tion to the agency is to protect public der if those senators have completed health and to set a standard that entheir discussion. i would like to pro- sures that adverse health effect will ceed for a few minutes. result from pollution. some of our laws
i wish to make a few comments about my colleague from rhode island. senator pell. who today annced that after 36 years in this chamber he will be retiring. this decision obviously can escape the reflection of the senate whose chamber has been given such dignity. such courtesy. such statesmanship through the dedicated service of claiborne pell.  can this anncement be taken lightly by our state. our joint state of rhode island. our small state. as you can expect. makes big demands on its senate delegation. we all k that the senate was created in the constitution in order to protect the smaller states from the will of the larger. more powerful. more prosperous states over the smaller ones. and over the years. different events have created special needs in our state that only the federal government has been able to adequately address. . there is doubt. . that the senate and the state of rhode island will miss senator pell. over 35 yearsand 36 when he finisheshe has served our nation and his state with great distinction. he  only lived up to the demands of his office. but. indeed. he left his handiwork on some of the most important areas and policy that our nation has encountered. let us just briefly take a look at them. first. i believe senator pell will be most remembered for his work in education. particularly providing for education for lower- and middleincome families in this nation of ours. . many of the younger people today. even the younger members of the senate refer kind of casually to pell grants. as though they have always been there. but they have . the principle behind that program was  as widely accepted as today when they were started by senator pell. in recognition for the great accomplishment as the primary sponsor of the legislation creating these grants. as i recall. it was a republican. senator javits. who proposed they be named the pell grants. it was that. i think. that was a reflection of the bipartisanship that existed in the foreign relations committee and in the labor committee among senator pell and his colleagues. and. indeed. it seems to me. as chairman of the foreign relations committee. one of the things that senator pell had always strived for was bipartisanship. to reach a consensus. to have matters reported out unilaterally. that has been one of his goals. he certainly has achieved it. . aher example has been senator pells longstanding commitment to protection of the oceans and the coastal resources of our country. he has been a champion. originator of the sea grant program. which is part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. and he has been the leading federal sponsor of the university of rhode islands school of ocearaphy. which is the crown jewel of one of our states fine institutions of higher education. senator pell has demonstrated his expertise in foreign affairs. he has been chairman of the committee on foreign relations for several years. he distinguished himself as a man of peace. his active work to achieve agreements with other nations to limit chemical weapons. for example. and nuclear weapons proliferation are matters that he has worked on constantly ever since he has been in this chamber. in addition. senator pell has been the leading advocate. the leading advocate in the senate. for the betterment of our nations cultural life. primarily through his sponsorship and initiation of the national endowment for the arts. and i think he will long be remembered for that likewise. question about it. beyond these overarching policy concerns. senator pell has been a strong advocate for our state. and it is a pleasure that i have had in working with him since the years that i have been here on things like the preservation of historic cliff walk in newport and the south east light on block island or retaining the submarine construction industry in our state. and when one out of every three rhode islanders found themselves without access to deposits through failed credit unions--one out of every three rhode islanders. 33 percent of our state. had some money tied up in credit unions when they failedsenator pell greatly helped in crafting federal assistance for that. above all. i wish to emphasize those personal qualities that senator pell has brought to this chamber as an example for all of us. at some point we have all been tired and contentious in debate with the sense that we will never finish some of this complicated legislation. but senator pell has never lost his pleasant disposition. his calmness. his sense of objectivity. his striving to achieve a consensus that i mentioned before. this is particularly important. his honesty coming through. and that is important in our state where we have had a series of mismanagement and scandals and outright failures. and. indeed. many people of our state have gotten very. very cynical about their elected officials. but  about senator pell. who has stayed on the high road ever since he came into public life. so. senator pell will leave the senate a better place for his having been here. my father used to say. "try to leave. wherever you have been. your work station a better place than when you got there." and certainly senator pell has followed that admonition. his work station. this work station. the senate of the united states. is a better place for his having been here. he has left an example for all of us to aspire to. so it is with regret and affection that i wish him well in the years to come and that he may enjoy the best of health and the pleasantries and good times that come with his family and with good health that i so hope that he will enjoy. i thank the chair. i thank the distinguished senator from new york for letting me proceed.
i want to assure the senator. because i was disturbed by that provision likewise. that there can be that kinda contribution to medicaid does  count. it has to be basically the afdc existing categories. it can be something for food stamps or medicaid or an automobile or something like that.
. the distinguished senator from illis is a member of the finance committee. so she is familiar with some of these items. obviously. but i heard her say that under the republican measure the medicare part b premiums are going to double. what is her source of information for that. what is she basing that on.
let me just say this. as the senator ks. we both worked together in the finance committee on the medicare matters. to say that the republicans are doubling the premiums on part b is adf inaccurate statement. if i may say so to the senator. we maintain the percentage that an individual pays under the part b premium at exactly the same amount that is there . the same amount that was there under a democratic administration and under us. it is 31.5 percent. . if the predictions show that the costs of the premiums are going up. that has hing to do with republicans being in charge. that is a fact of costs of health care. but to say it is a republican fault is a charge that i think is a very unfortunate one to make. i say to the distinguished senator from illis that what we have done on the medicare program is justified. have there been some deductibles increased. yes. there have. but the part b premium remains at exactly the same percentage that exists . and if the distinguished senator from illis objects to the affluence testing. then she is on a different course than i am and i think most of the american public.
if the premiums are going up--and who ks what the costs are going to be out there because we do  set forth a dollar amount. as the distinguished senator ks. we stay at exactly the same percentage. and if health care costs should go down. then the premiums will go down. if health care costs go up. then the premiums go up. to blame that on the republicans and on our medicare program is just a charge that i believe is highly unfair.
. there are two horses the democrats like to ride. one is social security. and the other is medicare. they like to ride both of them at the top of their lungs. as has been indicated here this evening. let us talk about medicare. which is the subject before us. there are a lot of deceptive statements being made here this evening in connection with medicare. one is that you are increasing the premiums. first. let us make clear what we are talking about. under medicare. there is part a. there is a trust fund and that pays for the hospitalization. part b is an insurance program. it is a voluntary insurance program that senior citizens can take if they so choose. and about 99plus percent choose the part b insurance program. what does the part b insurance program do. it covers the cost after the deductible for physicians. that is what part b is. let us look at a little bit of history. when part b was set up under medicare in the early 1960s. the thought and. indeed. the plan was that the beneficiary. the insured. would pay 50 percent of the premium and the federal government would pay the other 50 percent of the premium. however. due to the fact that it was set in dollars and medical inflation came along. what started out as a dollar premium that equaled 50 percent soon slid down. down. down and became less than 25 percent. something like 18 percent. so then we changed the law. and we provided that it be 25 percent as a minimum. but over the past several years that rose. and it currently is at 31.5 percent. that is what it is . and so this idea that by staying at 31.5 percent we are increasing the premium is absolute. total sense. it is important to remember this. the federal government is  paying. for the total part b premiums. as its share. namely the 69 percent that it pays. with the insured paying 31.5 percent. $42 billion a year. and we believe that the 31.5 percent premium that is currently being paid is a fair premium. it is  50 percent. as the authors of the legislation originally provided. and it is  40 percent. but it is 31.5 percent. that is what the republicans have provided. the argument is. well. do  do it on this bill. do it on something else. the problem is that unless we provide on this bill that it be at 31.5 percent. due to the mechanics of the machinery for social security and the withholding. and so forth and so on. because this is a premium that is deducted from the benefit of the social security recipients--in other words. when they choose to have the insurance. they provide that the premium be deducted from their social security income. and in order to keep it at this particular figure. 31.5 percent. it is required that legislation be enacted. that is why we are here this evening.
i k i am against sturdy competition. particularly in the volume level. but i would like to finish. we believe that a beneficiary paying 31.5 percent is fair. as you k. under the current law. when an individual is unable to pay the premium. then medicaid can step in. that is the current law of the land. medicaid is there to cover the deductibles. medicare is there to pay the part b premium. but we believe that it is fair for the beneficiary to pay 31.5 percent with the federal government paying 68.5. that is a pretty good deal. so that is what this is all about this evening. it has hing to do with the rich. you can read the language. and there is tax cut for the rich. i do  k where they get that from. it has hing to do with that. it is whether it is fair to say to the beneficiaries you are getting a very good deal here. and you can beat it for paying  the entire premium. indeed. there is means testing here. there is suggestion. as we have proposed and subsequently presumably it will come along in later days. that the more affluent pay more. that is  included here. i would be happy if it were. but that is  in this particular program. so. because of the mechanics that have to take place. it is important that this legislation be approved.
. let me explain this amendment. what it does is it modifies the standardsetting provisions of the bill for one contaminant. sulfate. what is sulfate. it is a naturally occurring substance that contaminates some groundwater used for drinking water. particularly in the western states. the 1986 amendments required epa to issue a standard for sulfates. it is one of the 83 contaminants we previously discussed. but epa has  completed the job yet. part of the problem has been inadequate scientific information on the adverse health effects caused by sulfate. we k that adverse effects occur. but we do  k exactly what concentration levels must occur to cause the effects. this amendment requires epa and the centers for disease control to collect more information before a standard is set. the amendment also delays the deadline for issuing a standard so that this research might be completed. senators pressler and daschle from south dakota and senator grams from minnesota have expressed particular interest in resolving the scientific questions associated with sulfate. and we thank them for their interest and help in preparing this amendment.
. of hewlettpackard has come about because of the management style which could be called managing by objective. namely. setting goals and giving employees wide latitude in achieving those goals. this was the style that dave packard believed in deeply. obviously. it works. but david packards achievements went beyond his success with hewlettpackard. he was a philanthropist who did much more than write out a check. he became deeply involved with the projects to which he contributed. a case in point: the lucile salter packard childrens hospital in palo alto. which the packard family gave to stanford university medical school and which i have had the privilege of visiting. this is a childrenfriendly hospital. buift for children. and one in which children can feel safe at home. dave and lucile packard made sure that was the way it was built. let me give an illustration: the registration desk in this hospital when you come inusually. a very forbidding structurehas peepholes in it at a childs level. so when a child comes in with his or. her parent. the child can look through the peephole and see what is going on behind this forbidding desk. the packards founded and funded the monterey bay aquarium. first opened 11 years ago. in 1985. dave packard was deeply involved with the inations at that aquarium. he designed and built. in his own workshop. some of the wavegenerating equipment that is in that marvelous aquarium. the monterey bay aquarium. with an annual attendance of over 1.5 million people every year. is the secondmost popular aquarium in the united states of america. in his book called "the hp way." dave wrote the following: "the word philanthropy is derived from a greek word that means lover of mankind." i think this is the phrase that best describes david packard. it was his enduring belief that his efforts. both individual and corporate. could make this world a betterplace for all to live in. in 1969. david packard became deputy secretary of defense. and that is when i came to k him. because i was. at the time. appointed secretary of the navy. my distinguished colleague from virginia also came to k dave packard at the same time. when the distinguished senator from virginia was appointed under secretary of the navy. for 3 years i had the privilege of working with dave packard and came to admire him greatly. he had the ability to cut right to the heart of a problem. he was laconic. he was  a great talker or backslapper. indeed. he had a semigruffappearing visage. but he was extremely fair. and he was helpful if one ran into a problem. most of all. he wanted to see the job done and done well. he made extremely valuable contributions to our nation as deputy secretary of defense. especially in the procurement area. during the years we were together in the defense department. my wife ginny and i came to become friends with david and lucile packard. it was a friendship we greatly valued. they were truly a teamand a wonderful one. lucile was a lovely lady in every way. dave was always a bit bemused by the abundance of aides and assistants one had in the pentagon. i remember him commenting that he and bill hewlett ran hewlettpackard co. sharing one secretary and one office. always a good athlete and an outdoor sportsman. dave played basketball and football at stanford. and later. while working for general electric in schnectady. ny. in the depths of the depression. in 1935. he made a few extra dollars a week playing professional basketball. a hunter and fisherman since boyhood. he maintained those interests throughout his life. and was a major contributor to conservation organizations. dave packard was an extremely thoughtful person and would go out of his way to help an individual. i was the beneficiary of his kindness in many areas. many times. including a special tour for ginny and me of the aquarium. by he and lucile. contributions of his. and his personal appearances at various political fundraisers for me in san francisco and hospitality at his palo alto home. in his death. i feel like a great oak tree has fallen in the forest. i have lost a real friend. and our nation has lost a unique and extraordinarily constructive and thoughtful patriot.
it came from dave packard. he was the principal proponent of it. he felt we were having trouble getting physicians in the military service forces. and that we had tlese major research hospitals and outstanding hospitals. walter reed and bethesda. and we needed our own medical school. which we did get.
first of all. i would like to thank the distinguished senator from vermont for permitting me to go ahead of him. i k he has been waiting. i assured him my staterent would be brief. so i am going to be held to that. .  only with the health care measure that we tried in 1994. but in other efforts in the past. in the last 2 years. over a million americans lost their health insurance coverage. although this proposal. the kassebaumkennedy proposal. does  include many of the health reforms which i advocated 2 years ago. i strongly support its enactment as a sound first step toward reform and improvementlin our nations health care system. so i congratulate the two principal cosponsors of this legislation and am delighted to be listed as a cosponsor myself. i thank the chair.
. first. i want to thank each of the speakers who took the trouble to come here today in support of this effort that senator breaux and i have the privilege of leading. second. i would like to say that what this is all about is future generations. unless we do something about these entitlements. this country of ours is going to be in great financial and ecoic peril. if we take these steps  that we have outlined. then there is a wonderful chanceit is  only a chance. it is a factthat we can reverse the trends that are  underway in our two largest spending programssocial security and medicareas well as medicaid and welfare. so this is it. it is easy to criticize. and people. as i mentioned earlier. will say. "im all for it. except for the cpi." or "im all for it. except for the medicare number." or "i dont like your tax figure." but ody else has come forward with a program that has the support of senators on both sides of the aisle. democrats and republicans. so this is it. and we hope that everybody. every single senator in this body will carefully consider what we have come up with. we sincerely hope that they will join with us. we want more people. there are 22 of us who have worked together on this since october. but 22 is  egh. and it is  egh for senators to say. "well. thats pretty good. well see what else is going to come along." hing else is going to come along that we k of. we have been involved with this for some time. so we do seek support from our fellow senators on both sides of the aisle. the beneficiaries will be our children and our grandchildren. and that is a pretty worthwhile goal. i thank the chair and certainly thank my distinguished colleague. senator breaux. who has been terrific in the leadership he has given to this program right from the beginning.
. i hope everybody will listen to this because we think it is important. illegal immigrants  are entitled to a series of limited benefits. such as emergency medicaid. prenatal medicaid services. nutrition programs. and public assistance for immunizations. illegal aliens are entitled to this. this is  the big broad scope of things. this is limited. what we are saying is legal immigrants should be entitled to the same thing. it is a little odd to say that the illegals can get these. why do we give them to those individuals. the illegals. it is for the benefit of public health overall. it seems to me that the legal immigrants should likewise be entitled to immunization. prenatal. and postpartum medicaid services. that is what it is all about. it is a limited group. it is  going to break the budget. but certainly the legals under equity should be entitled to what the illegals are entitled to. thank you.
i wonder if i am also correct in suggesting that. under the proposal of the senator from delaware. under his seconddegree amendment. you could have a situation where the woman is on the rolls  and therefore she is medicaid eligible. then suppose she goes off as a result of earnings. can that individual come back on if her earnings fall below the earnings limitation. yes. fall below. so she would be eligible once again for cash assistance. would she get medicaid.
that is  the testimony that we had before the finance committee. the testimony we had was very clear that the medicaid situation is a big factor.  just for the adult. but for the children likewise. it affects peoples behavior.
. this legislation is welfare reform. we dropped out the changes in medicaid. and we are told that this is  a medicaid bill. yet. this bill permits the states  only to drop eligibility levels for cash assistanceafdcbut also for medicaid. the states can throw a woman and small children off cash assistance and at the same time take away their medicaid. their only chance for any medical services. my amendment says. go ahead. if you wish. reduce eligibility levels for welfare. but medicaid eligibility levels should remain as they are today. furthermore. what constitutes income in calculating medicaid eligibility remains as it is . in other words. if my amendment is  adopted. states will be able to count school lunches and even disaster relief toward what makes a person eligible for medicaid
. if you voted yes on the chafee amendment we just agreed to. then you should vote on the roth amendment. the roth amendment allows states to drastically reduce medicaid coverage for all groups of women and children. if the roth amendment prevails and we strike the protections that we just adopted in my amendment. the roth amendment grandfathers only those afdceligible individuals who are enrolled in medicaid at the time of enactment.* there are protections for those who meet the same standards after the enactment. second. it strikes the provisions in my amendment that reinstate the -standard for calculating income. thus. a pregnant woman or 6yearold child with a family income below the current poverty standards will  qualify for medicaid coverage if the state adopts a more restrictive income test. such as school lunches or food stamps. finally. i would say the united states has the highest percentage of children in poverty of any industrial nation in the world. i *certainly hope we will  make it worse by denying these children their medicaid coverage.
it is my understanding that the parliamentarian ed that the previous definitions of "federal meanstested public benefit" were broad egh to include discretionary spending. according to the parliamentarian. that inclusion caused the definition to violate section 313(b)(1)(d) of the byrd rule. which prevents reconciliation legislation from extending its scope to items that provide merely incidental deficit reduction. that is. discretionary programs. therefore. when the bill was considered in conference. i understand that there was an intentional effort to ensure this provision complied with byrd rule by omitting the definition of that particular term. in other words. then. the term "federal meanstested public beneft"-if it is to be in compliance with the byrd ruledoes  refer to discretionary programs. i would assume that programs such as funding for community health centers. as well as the maternal and child health block grant. would  be impacted.
. when i heard about this amendment of the senator from new jersey originally. my first thought was. why is the federal government getting involved in deciding how long hospital stays are. it seemed to me that was a matter that quite properly should be handled by states. and indeed in my state we have handled it. we have a bill. the best as i understand it. that is very similar to the suggestion of the bill proposed by the senator from new jersey. indeed. i made es of the senators remarks. he indicated that some 28 states have taken action. that does  mean they have gone the complete routeand the senator can obviously explain that furtherbut i take it some 28 states have dealt with this matter of how long a hospital stay should be or could be. so i will confess that my original reaction was unfavorable to the senators proposal. however. two things happened. for one thing. my daughter called me. she has four children and she has some views on this subject. and also the erisa point that the senator raised. and i would like to explore that if i might. finally. the socalled frist amendment. i am  sure exactly what the frist amendment does. but my first question would be. of the senator from new jersey. as i understand itfirst. i want to say. i listened to his arguments. one of his arguments is that you need a national law because you might have the state wherein the individual resides on a town right on the border of aher state where the hospital is that serves that town. and the other state does  have the legislation. however. i thought the most telling argument he made was the socalled erisa argument. that is. as i understand it. that because erisa applies to those corporations that have interstate health care plans. that the erisa law prevents the state governmentand we dealt with this. of course. when we were dealing with the health care business in 1994the erisa prevents the state law from getting involved with the plans that are covered by the erisa statute. i had  thought of that. and so first. if the senator would be good egh to explain a little bit on that. is that point correct.
 signed into law bipartisan legislation that provides greater portability of health insurance for working americans. today. i join with my colleagues. senator rockefeller. senator frist. senator jeffords. and senator collins. in the introduction of a bipartisan bill that will provide some of the same guarantees for medicare beneficiaries who buy medicare supplemental insurance or medigap policies. of the 38 million medicare beneficiaries. about 80 percent. or 31 million. have some form of medicare supplemental insurance. whether covered through an employersponsored health plan. medicaid or aher public program. or a private medigap policy. our bill does several important things for medicare beneficiaries who have had continuous coverage: first. it guarantees that if their plan goes out of business or the beneficiary moves out of a plan service area. he or she can buy aher comparable policy. these rules also would apply to a senior who has had coverage under a retiree health plan or medicare select if their plan goes out of business. second. it encourages beneficiaries to enroll in medicare managed care by guaranteeing that they can return to medicare feeforservice and. during the first year of enrollment. get back their same medigap policy if they decide they do  like managed care. under current law. if a senior wishes to enroll in a medicare managed care plan. he or she has two options. the medigap policy may be dropped if the senior chooses a managed care program. or the individual can continue to pay medigay premiums in the event that the policy is needed again some daya very costly option for those on fixed incomes. many seniors fear that if they lose their supplemental policy after entering a managed care plan. it may be financially impossible for them to reenroll in medigap. third. it bans preexisting condition exclusion periods for medicare beneficiaries who obtain medigap policies when they are first eligible for medicare. under current law. any time insurers sell a medigap policy. they can limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health conditions for a 6month period. fourth. it establishes a guaranteed open enrollment period for those under 65 who become medicare beneficiaries because they are disabled. under current federal law. medicare beneficiaries are offered a 6month open enrollment period only if they are 65. there are approximately 5 million americans who are under 65 years of age and are enrolled in the medicare program. currently. they do  have access to medigap policies unless state laws require insurers to offer policies to them. our bill provides for a onetime open enrollment period for the current medicare disabled. which will guarantee access to all medigap plan options for almost 5 million disabled americans. it is true that this bill does  go as far as some would like. our bill leaves to the states more controversial issues. such as continuous open enrollment and community rating of medigap premiums. i believe. however. that this legislation will provide seniors similar guarantees to those that we provided to working americans under the kassebaumkennedy legislation.
. i am very pleased today to introduce legislation to provide health insurance for millions of children who are  currently covered. before i talk about the bill. let me take a moment to thank all of the members of the bipartisan coalition who have worked so hard to put this legislation together. senator rockefeller. the lead democratic cosponsor and my colleague on the finance committee. deserves very special mention in this regard. senator rockefeller has worked for many. many years on these issues and i am personally grateful for all his leadership and hard work in this endeavor. he is a true hero when it comes to americas children. there are currently 10 million children in this country who do  have health insurance. many of these children li in families where one or both parents are working but do  have employee coverage and earn too much to qualify for medicaid. others. though eligible. simply fall through the cracks. while still others lose eligibility because of agebased restrictionsg. this is a tragic problem and our proposal tries to provide real solutions. the chafeerockefeller proposal offers the states additional federal matching funds if they choose to provide medicaid coverage to all children up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level. it is a completely voluntary programwe hope that all states will participate. but we leave that decision to the govers. states. like rhode island. that are already providing coverage at these levels will immediately begin to get additional federal matching funds once they have provided the 1year continuous coverage. our bill also provides grant funds for states to use for outreach to the 3 million children who are eligible for medicaid but  enrolled. i believe that the medicaid program is the best avenue to reach these uninsured children. expansions in the medicaid program over the years have done wonders in increasing coverage for children and pregnant women. we also have to keep an eye on cost. and medicaid is an inexpensive way to cover childrenwhile half of medicaid beneie s3849 ficiaries are children. children only account for 15 percent of overall medicaid spending. and medicaid is a program that already exists. so we dont have to create a new program or a new bureaucracy. in short. medicaid works and works well. by encouraging states to provide medicaid coverage to all children under 18 up to 150 percent of poverty. our proposal also tries to fix one of the programs problems: under the current medicaid program a childs eligibility depends  only on family income. but also on age. let me illustrate this for you: a 6yearold girl lives in a family of four whose annual income is $21.000. that little girl gets medicaid because federal law requires that all children 6 and under be covered up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. on her seventh birthday. that little girl doesnt get much of a birthday presentshe loses her medicaid coverage because federal law only requires that children between the ages of 7 and 13 be covered up to 100 percent of poverty. and her familys income level is slightly above that level. her 4yearold brother. however. keeps his medicaid coverage. at least for the next 2 years. how bizarre that there are two children in the same family and one gets coverage because hes under 6 and the other doesnt because shes older than 6. our proposal would give states the option to continue medicaid coverage for both children until they are 18. so. i am very pleased to introduce this legislation today along with this distinguished bipartisan group of senators. i look forward to working together toward the goal of getting critical health care coverage to these children.
 to extend mostfavorednation. or mal trading relations. status to china on a permanent basis. since 1989. congress has engaged in an annual. and very public. debate about the extension of mfn to chiria. these debates have been highly charged. but over the years. the repetition of this debate has carried a heavy price tag. with little to positive results to show for it. in fact. the constant debate as to whether or  the united states should continue mal trade relations with china has come at great expense to the overall health of the bilateral relationship between these two great and powerful nations. and that. in turn. has had realand negativerepercussions for the united states. its citizens. and even the chinese people themselves. we need to look toward a day where this annual mfn rollercoaster will be replaced by a stable. longterm ecoic foundation between these two superpowers. it is toward that end that we are introducing this legislation.
. i intend to vote for the hatchkennedy amendment. it is paid for by a 43centperpack increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes. we must do everything we can to discourage smoking and to advance good health policy. in my view. this does both. however. in doing so. i want to be very clear about my order of priorities in terms of addressing the childrens health crisis in this country. if the hatchkennedy amendment fails. and we do  get any additional spending for childrens health initiatives above and beyond the $16.8 billion already included in this budget resolution. i intend to place all of my energies behind strengthening the very cornerstone of our federal efforts to provide health insurance to poor childrenthe medicaid program. my first priority will be to work in the finanqe committee to enact the chafeerockefellerjeffordsbreaux bill which provide incentives-- mandates--to encourage states to expand their medicaid programs to cover all children aged 18 and under. up to 150 percent of poverty. through this voluntary medicaid expansion. which  has the support of a majority of the members of the senate finance committee. we can strengthen the system already in place across the country to reach up to 5 million more children. this is the most costeffective way to proceed. does  create any new entitlement programs. and is a kn quantity in every state. what am i saying here. let us strengthen the foundation before we build the building. in an environment of scarce resources. we must first work to reach the very neediest children through the medicaid progran before we create other programs with potentially overlapping objectives. i would have a very different view if we had unlimited resources. but we do . i would  like to recognize senators rockefeller and jeffords to get an indication of their priorities.
. we have worked very hard to ensure that this legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of medicaid beneficiaries and the managed care companies. i want to thank senators breaux and kerrey who helped craft this legislation and are original cosponsors. i also want to thank the many advocacy organizations for their input and support. and i also want to thank some of the managed care organizations who worked with us. i am especially pleased that some of these organizations. such as the hmo group which is an alliance of health maintenance organizations have endorsed this legislation. their support is critical to the success of medicaid managed care. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included in the record.
. we are facing an emergency here. this legislation. which came from the finance committee. proposes to do something about it. what is the situation. in 1950. which is 47 years ago. there were 16 workers for every retiree16 workers in the united states paying* into the hospital insurance fund and paying into social security.
as i said. 47 years ago. in 1950. there were 16 workers for every retiree. today. there are 3 workers for every retiree 16. but 3. twentyeight years from . in the year 2025. the ratio will fall to two workers for every retiree. so something has to be done if this medicare trust fund is going to survive. what we have proposed ii increasing the medicare eligibility age to conform with that of social security. in 1983. we raised the age of social security eligibility gradually. it comes into full force in the year 2025. by the year 2025. the retirement age will be 67.  the 65 that it is today. we have proposed that the medicare program step up in similar fashion. the key thing. . is to take these actions . dont wait until the baby boomers are all there collecting .and we cant do anything about it. . if we act. we can take these very gradual steps. for example. the first step will be in 2003. 6 years from . when the eligibility age for social security and medicare will go from 65 to 65 and 2 months. then it goes up to 65 and 10 months by the year 2007. then we take a break for 11 yearsexcuse me: in 2008. it will be at age 66. and then gradually it goes up by 2 months and 4 months and 6 months until the year 2025. when the retirement age for social security-
social security is already set. that goes to 67. we did that in 1983. that goes to age 67 in 2025. what we do in this program is to have medicare conform to that. . this is a very wise provision that we did. in a bipartisan manner. in the finance committee. and i certainly hope that it will withstand any attacks. i thank the chair and i thank the distinguished chairman of our committee.
. there are some saying. "oh. you are giving them a cadillac package." it is just  so. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a comparison between what medicaid provides. which some could say is a cadillac package. and what we have in here. which we provide. which is just what the blue cross provides. you can see as you look down the list that blue cross does  cover shoes and corrective devices. transportation to medical services. family counseling. hearing care or vision care. so we go with the blue cross package with the exception of adding vision care and hearing assistance.
i would like to address this. . if i might. to the distinguished chairman of the finance committee. it is also my understanding that a state would be able to use any new funds to provide health coverage for children under 200 percent of poverty and use existing state dollars. mally used for this purpose. in order to provide health care coverage for children over 200 percent of poverty.
. as well as democratic party leaders. to disavow and distance themselves from candidates who resort to mediscare demagoguery in their future political campaigns. the american people deserve a responsible debate on this difficult subject. and the centrist coalition will be working to see that this happens. this bill does include a number of helpful changes for medicare beneficiaries. lowincome children. and legal immigrants which i would like to briefly highlight. medigap provisions included in this bill. which i was pleased to author earlier this year. will do for medicare beneficiaries much of what the kassebaumkennedy health insurance bill did for working americans: it vastly improves portability and bans preexisting condition limitations for medigap policy holders. this bill also improves access to emergency services for medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. which is derived from legislation senator graham authored and i was glad to cosponsor earlier this year. this provision establishes a prudent layperson definition of emergency medical conditions to ensure that emergency services are properly covered. this legislation also includes expanded preventive health care benefits for medicare enrollees. including mammography. colorectal and prostate cancer screening. testing for osteoporosis. and improved coverage for diabetes and other important prevention measures. these enhanced services will be helpful to the more than 174.000 medicare beneficiaries in rhode island. one of my most important priorities. that of expanding access to health insurance for lowincome children. is also addressed in this bill. i am especially pleased that we are providing $24 billion for this purpose. this is a critical step forward for rhode islands children. 19 percent of whom live in poverty. many of these poor children38 percentlive in families where at least one parent is working. yet they are still poor. these funds are targeted to help these families especially. while i would have preferred greater specificity in terms of the benefits to be provided to children under this program. the final package is a significant improvement over some of the earlier proposals. i want to thank and ackledge senator rockefeller for his leadership and expertise in working to advance the cause for childrens health insurance. he was a strong partner in helping to make this a stronger and better program than it otherwise would have been. i also want to thank senator roth for helping me to ensure that rhode island can take full advantage of the funding provided under this program to continue its childrens health initiatives. the finance committee chairman was very responsive to the problems this legislation posed for states. like rhode island. that have already expanded coverage. we were able to work together to ensure that rhode island will  be penalized for choosing to expand coverage on its own. this bill also gives states critical new flexibility by allowing them to enroll medicaid beneficiaries into managed care without obtaining a waiver from the department of health and human services. at the same time. the legislation includes important safeguards for these beneficiaries. many of which were contained in legislation i introduced earlier this year. for example. disabled children. children in foster care and special needs children who have been adopted are protected from mandatory enrollment in managed care. women enrolled in medicaid managed care programs will continue to have the freedom to choose their family planning provider. even if that provider is  part of their managed care plan. this bill also restores medicaid coverage to thousands of children who were removed from the ssi rolls as a result of eligibility changes made in the 1996 welfare reform law. this will be emously helpful to many lowincome families whose children may longer be considered statutorily disabled but who nevertheless have significant special health care needs. let me take a moment to describe the provisions of this bill dealing with legal immigrants. as my colleagues k. the 1996 welfare reform law placed severe restrictions on the federal benefits that legal immigrants may receive. among these restrictions was a complete and immediate cutoff of supplemental security income [ssi] and food stamp benefits.  only for future immigrants but for those already in this country legally. for the elderly and disabled legal immigrants who last august were in the united states--including nearly 4.000 in my own state of rhode islandthe new ssi ban represented hing short of a crisis. for many. the loss of this critical federal aid would mean losing the ability to live independently. in turn. this would present a serious community and fiscal challenge to state and local governments. as immigrants who had lost benefits and faced destitution turned to nursing homes or other costly facilities for support. i was sorely troubled by these restrictions on immigrants. and pledged to do what i could to mitigate the most harsh of these during this congress. i am delighted to say that in this regard. we have been successful. the conference report before us  is identical to the senatepassed bill on which i and others of my colleagues worked very hard. it restores benefits to those legal immigrants who were receiving ssi as of last august. it also allows immigrants who were in the united states last august and who may become .disabled in the future to receive ssi. for my state. this means that 3.753 currently elderly and disabled rhode island residents--and many others who may become disabled in the futurewill be able to receive basic ssi assistance to allow them to live with dignity. . the immigrant provisions of this bill are  perfect. and i am disappointed that it does  contain the chafeegraham amendment on legal immigrant children and medicaid. or the provision dealing with ssi for those too disabled to naturalize. but the bill before us goes a long way toward restoring fair treatment for the thousands of legal. taxpaying immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when welfare reform was enacted. i want to commend senators damato. feinstein. dewine. and graham for all of their hard work in helping to solve this problem. since the introduction of our fairness for legal immigrants act in april. we have been working as a united team toward fair treatment for legal immigrants. with passage of this bill. our efforts will have met with success. in closing. i am hopeful that we can build upon the bipartisanship that was necessary to make this bill a reality when we turn to the more challenging task of advancing longterm budget and entitlement reforms in the future. i particularly want to address the entitlement reforms i strongly believe are necessary for medicare. although the provisions we worked hard onmeans testing the part b premium. increasing the age of eligibility from 65 to 67. the $5 home health care copayment--were dropped in the final package. etheless. i think it behooves all of us to continue our work on each of these measures. and certainly i will do everything i can to advance them. i thank the chair.
i would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank and ackledge the tremendous work of the senator from louisiana in connection with the medicare reforms that we undertook. one was a stouter soul in that effort to face up to what had to be done if we are going to continue to have medicare. it was the senator from louisiana who joined in leading the effort. in having the means testing in the part b premium and raising the eligibility age to 67 and having a copayment. a payment for the home health care visits. of 7 percent. i share the disappointment that the senator from louisiana has voiced in that these elements we worked on did  survive. but i see others here. the distinguished senator from new york was right in the lead in these efforts. all i can say is. disappointed though we were. despite the overwhelming vote that took place on the floor of the senate on both the means testing and the raising of the eligibility age. up or down votes--one got 70 votes. the means testing. 70 to 30. and the other got something like 62 to 38. in that neighborhood. over 60 votes. in raising the age to 67they didnt survive the conference because of objections from the other body. but this is what i want to say. . disappointed though we might be in those particular facts. those particular undertakings. etheless we have made some substantial achievements in having them so accepted here.
. i ask unanimous consent that the senate committee on indian affairs be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. october 8. 1997. at 9:30 a.m.. in room 485 of the russell senate building to conduct an oversight hearing on the indian provisions contained in the tobacco settlement between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry.
. i am pleased to support the ination of. dr. david satcher for u.s. surgeon general and assistant secretary for health. i have examined his qualifications and achievements. and i believe he has the capacity to serve this country well in the important role of the nations top physician. on tuesday of this week. i. along with senators graham and jeffords and representatives moran and leach. annced the formation- of the congressional prevention coalition. former surgeon general c. everett koop was kind egh to join us at the press conference. during the course of his remarks. it struck me how greatly we have missed having a national spokesperson on health issues the past three years. dr. koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use. lack of exercise. and poor diet. he didnt pull any punches--he gave a stern lecture to all of those present on the dangers inherent in the socalled couch potato lifestyle. i have reviewed dr. satchers statements before the senate labor committee. and he clearly is anxious to start in along the same lines. at his confirmation hearing. dr. satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. as he put it. "whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets. i want to send the message of good health to the american people." and i was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities in this role would be to put the health of our childen and grandchildren in the national spotlight. to my view. all of these matters fall directly within the job description of a u.s. surgeon general. as i said. we have been without a surgeon general for three years a period of time when we have been confronted with a staggering array of public health issues. the need for a surgeon general has never been greater. as we are seeing an increase in smoking among high school seniors. widespread substance abuse. continuing struggles with aids. and a startling rate of obesity among youngsters. and as we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research. i k that i. for one. would benefit from the perspective that a surgeon general could bring to this issue. several of my colleagues have expressed their misgivings about this ination. some have raised concerns about .dr. satchers views on late term abortions. others have questioned his role in a series of azt trials that were conducted in africa. as senator jeffords. the chairman of labor committee. and senator frist. the chairman of the public health and safety subcommittee. stated during the debate on the ination yesterday. however. these are  new charges. indeed. each of these issues was raised by the committee during dr. satchers confirmation hearing. and its my understanding that he responded satisfactorily. indeed. his answers on these and other matters have been available to all senators and the american people for some months  via the internet. dr. satchers participation in many aspects of the health care systemprovider. scientist. public and private administratorgive him the extensive kledge and experience necessaryr to fulfill his role as the u.s. surgeon general. he has dedicated his career to improving public health. i urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of dr. satchers ination.
madam president. last week i put into the record a statement expressing my support for the ination of dr. david satcher for u.s. surgeon general and assistant secretary for health. as i indicated then. i believe in his qualifications and achievements. and think he would serve well as the nations top physician. dr. satcher has excelled in many aspects of the health care system. he has been a provider. a scientist. a teacher. an administrator. in both the private and the public sector. i must say i was impressed that the american college of physicians. which is a very prestigious organization. awarded dr. satcher its james d. bruce memorial award for distinguished contributions in preventive medicine. dr. satcher has dedicated his career to improving public health. the united states has been without a surgeon general for a little over 3 years. this is unfortunate. i believe. just last week. dr. c. everett koop. former surgeon general of the united states. spoke at a press conference which i had the privilege of attending. in that press conference dr. koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use. lack of exercise. and poor diet. he did  pull any punches. he gave a stern lecture to all those who were present and hopefully beyond that. about the dangers in america to american young people and to all our citizens from the socalled couch potato lifestyle. i have reviewed the statements that dr. satcher has made before the senate labor committee and he is clearly anxious to follow in the footsteps of dr. koop and his successor. antonia ello. at his confirmation hearing dr. satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. this is what he said: "whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets. i want to send the message of good health to the american people." so i was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities would be to put the health of our children and our grandchildren in the national spotlight. all of these matters fall directly within the job description of a u.s. surgeon general. i might say. it seems to me what we are concerned with. madam president. is  just extending the life expectancy of americans. it is beyond that. we want to have americans in good health as they proceed in their elder years. and throughout all their lives. in other words. its what they call the quality of their lives that we are concerned with. it is  just living longer. its that they be healthy and be able to construct a healthy life and a happy one. where they feel good about themselves. . in the period we have gone without a surgeon general. we have been confronted with a host of tough public health issues. i believe the need for a surgeon general has never been greater. wehave these problems in my home state of a very substantial percentage. something like 27 percent. of our seniors in high school smoke. this is on the increase.  just in my state but throughout the nation. we have seen widespread substance abuse. and continued struggle with aids. and a startling rate of obesity amongst our youngsters. they just dont get out there and exercise. as we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research. i for one would benefit from the perspective that a surgeon general would bring to this issue several of my colleagues have ex- pressed misgivings about this ination. some have raised concerns about dr. satchers views on lateterm abortions. others have questioned his role in a series of azt trials that have been conducted in africa. i just heard the distinguished senator from missouri talk about concerns about the free needle exchange. or needle exchange program. as senator jeffords. the chairman of the labor committee. and senator frist. the chairman of the public health and safety subcommittee. stated during the debate on the ination last week. these are  new charges. i am  familiar with the needle exchange that was just being discussed here before. but apparently the azt trials and the lateterm abortion matters were thoroughly discussed in the committee and subcommittee. each of these issues was raised by the committee during dr. satchers confirmation and it is my understanding he responded satisfactorily--satisfactorily to the committee. they reported out the ination. indeed. his answers on those and other -matters have been available for all senators and the american people to view. so i want to say i am pleased that we have the ination for a new surgeon general before us. i applaud the majority leader for recognizing the importance of this post and moving the senate forward on this matter. so i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture and in favor of dr. satchers ination. madam president. i suggest the absence of a quorum.
madam president. this is what we might call a repeat offenders amendment. i filed it last friday so that our members would have a chance. and their staffs. to look at it and consider it. the amendment would strengthen and clarify the repeat drunk driving offenders section of the bill. that is. the underlying bill. the bill. as currently drafted. requires states to act and support penalties for drunk drivers who have a blood alcohol concentration of .15 or greater. and two things have to occurthe drunk driver is arrested. has a blood alcohol content of .15 or greater. and has been convicted of a second or third or more drunk driving offense within 5 years. this amendment. of which senator dewine is the lead sponsor. is cosponsored by senator lautenberg. senator warner. senator chafee. senator baucus. and senator dorgan. and what it does. it strikes the reference to the .15 blood alcohol concentration and lets the state law on blood alcohol concentration determine what is a "repeat offender." the amendment. therefore. clarifies that a person who is arrested for driving with a blood alcohol concentration level lower than .15. such as .08 or .10. still may be classified as a repeat offender if the state so chooses. so. in essence. madam president. what this amendment does. instead of our setting it at a federal level. we. let the states set the level for the second or greater offense that has occurred within the 5 years.

. over the course of the next month or two. the senate will have the opportunity to debate how best to address the most significant. preventable public health problem confronting this nation today: the scourge of tobacco use by our young people. the senate will face some difficult choices in this regard. the grim statistics about this epidemic. coupled with almost daily revelations of tobacco industry misdeeds. underscore the -need for our earnest action. we can all agree. where adults are concerned personal responsibility must be the rule. tobacco is a legal product and adults are free to make that choice. however. the same level of independent judgment can be said where fourteen yearolds are concerned. bear in mind. only one in ten smokers takes up smoking after the age of eighteen. the remainder start well before that stage. all of usdemocrats and republicans--share a deep and abiding concern about this problem. and a recognition that  is the time for action. however. each of us has different thoughts on how best to attack this problem. the commerce committee draft bill offers a good beginning. but it must be strengthened. senators harkin. graham and. i believe that an aggressive. but responsible approach is essential if we are to be successful in reducing teen tobacco use. this is why the kids act would force the price of cigarettes up by $1.50 over the course of two four. five or sixyears. the price hike must be significant and rapid in order to affect the purchasing behavior of children. the evidence solidly favors that position. simply put. a smaller increase of only $1.10 over a longer period of timein effect 20 cents per year in the commerce committee draftwill  achieve the desired result. as a result of our aggressive approach on price. the kids act would halve teen smoking within just three years. that is also why the kids act contains very stiff socalled lookback" penalties if the industry fails to meet the annual youth reduction targets specified in our bill. unlike the commerce.committee draft. the kids act emphasizes companyspecific penalties to ensure that the companies who do the addicting take the hit. additionally. our annual penalties are capped at $10 billion per year. as opposed to $3.5 billion in the commerce committee draft. these lookback penalties are the very heart of our efforts to curb youth tobacco use. if they miss the mark. the whole program is.the weaker for it. this is also why the kids act provides roughly $5.1 billion per year for antitobacco programs. including counteradvertising. school and communitybased prevention and education. programs. cessation and other initiatives. for those who think this is too much spending. we spend a lot more money on addressing other ills which kill far fewer than 400.000 americans per year. recognizing that the needs of each state are very different. the kids act hands. back -$6 billion per year to the states in recognition of the costs and damages they have incurred in treating tobaccorelated illnesses.. importantly. this funding could be used to meet the particular needs of each state. flexibility is. the key with -respect to the use of this funding. one pool of $3 billion per year could beused to meet any need. the other pool of $3 billion takes the form of a health. human services- and education block grant to meet virtually any humanneed. our bill also includes a state performance bonus pool to help incent and enlist states- in the war against teen tobacco use.- and we need all the stakeholders we can get. as a consequence of these provisions. the national govers association supports the state payment mechanism contained in the kids act. some have pointed out that the draftcommerce committeebill incorporates the cap on annual. liability payments included in our billalthough at $6.5 billion.  $8 billion. my response -is that the cap can be examined in isolatioir from the other parts of the legislation. if. for example. the youth smok. ingprovisions are  as tough as they should be. than i question the appropriateness.of a liability cap. . some people have said our bill is too tough and could. bankrupt the tobacco industry. says who. the tobacco companies. im  sure we can rely upon their representations if- past history is any judge. what about the securities analysts who understand the financial workings of. the tobacco industry. can we rely. upon. these individuals and firms when many of these- samecompanies manage pension. and mutual fund. portfolios with significant investments in tobacco stocks. frankly. i think the only reliable- measure of what the industry can truly afford would be an independent audit an illogical request of an industry which seeks a virtually unprecedented deal with the federal government. the several states and the american people.
. today i am introducing legislation regarding one small aspect of the national tobacco debate. this bill addresses the problem of secondhand smoke. also kn as environmental tobacco smoke. or ets for short. it is my hope that the ideas contained in this bill can be incorporated into any tobacco legislation acted on by the senate. the committee on environment and public works recently held a hearing on ets at which we learned that the principal victims of secondhand smoke are children who live with smokers. tobacco smoke has devastating consequences for children under 18 months of age. annually. up to 15.000 infants are hospitalized for lung infections caused by ets such as bronchitis and pneumonia. these severe lung infections claim the lives of hundreds of children each year. secondhand smoke is also responsible for less severe lung infections in 300.000 infants. 26.000 new cases of asthma among children. millions of middle ear infections. and roughly half the cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids). these preventable illnesses. but 40 percent of children in one multistate study were found to be routinely exposed to tobacco smoke. the bill i am introducing today would assign some of the funds cbllected under any national tobacco settlement approved by congress to a state grant program to educate parents about the dangers of smoking in the home. the statistics i just recited are  widely kn by parents. once aware of the profound risk ets poses for their child. most parents will go to great lengths to protect their child. and i believe that even includes parents who smoke. with the grant funds from this bill. states could provide information about ets to pediatricians and other child care professionals for distribution to parents. states also could develop advertising aimed at parents. we only need to arm parents with information. they will do the rest.
. the evidence is clear. the most effective thing we can do to prevent our children from taking that first deadly cigarette is to increase the price quickly and steeply. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the kennedy amendment. i thank the chair. 3 thank the floor managers.
madam president. i would like to address the question of the national tobacco policy and youth smoking reduction act. s. 1415. this aftern. which the senate is resuming consideration of today. this is a very important bill. and i k the occupant of the chair shares my concerns with this legislation and a concern that it be passed. this seeks to address a serious problemtobacco use among our young people. both conservatives and liberals fault this legislation. some say it is  strong egh. some say it goes too far. i think it strikes an appropriate balance and merits our support. it is  a perfect bill. but i dont think we should let perfection be the enemy of the good. by striving constantly for what each of us wants in the perfect bill. we wont end up with anything. i am concerned about that. madam president. if one counts the mondays and fridays as part of each working week. there are only 68 legislative days remaining in this congressional session before we adjourn for the midterm elections in the fall. sixtyeight days is  very long. time is of the essence if we are going to enact a comprehensive tobacco bill this year. i certainly believe congress should enact such legislation. thus. i am hopeful that. following a vigorous and healthy debate. the senate will pass the mccain bill and send it along to the house. given all the disinformation circulating about this legislationmost of it. i might say. initiated by the tobacco industryi would like to take a few moments of the senates time to review the bidding as to why we are considering national tobacco legislation at this time. the opponents of s. 1415. the socalled mccain bill. would have us believe that this legislation is a case of tax and spend liberalism gone wild. that this bill is an excessive response to a relatively mi social problemthat of tobacco use among the young peopleand that an antitobacco media campaign is all we need. that is an adequate response. well. for years the tobacco industry sought to discredit studies which linked smoking to cancer and other diseases. then the industry told us that nicotine was  addictive.  the industry says it doesnt target kids with any advertising or marketing programs and that this legislation is just aher opportunitythe mccain legislationfor washington to increase taxes on the u.s. public. lets look at the facts. there is indisputable consensus within the public health community that tobacco use constitutes the single most preventable cause of death in this country. in other words. of all the possibilities of reducing deaths in our country. including better exercise. reduction in fat consumption. conducting what we might call a healthful life. all of those things put together arent as effective in improving the health of the united states of america as giving up smoking would be. in other words. it is the single most preventable cause of death. who says that. is it i. senator chafee from rhode island.  at all. it is the centers for disease control. here is a chart. this chart says tobacco kills more americans than alcohol. car accidents. suicides. aids. homicides. illegal drugs. and fires combined. in other words. all the effort we go to in this country to lecture people to use seat belts in order to reduce automobile accidents or fatalities and injuries from automobile accidents. and all we do about counseling in connection with suicides. and the money we pour into aids prevention and attempted cures. and homicides. and the battle against illegal drugs and fires. and all we do to prevent fires from occurring in households. and the lectures on alcoholif you put all of those together. tobacco kills more americans than alcohol. car accidents. suicides. aids. homicides. illegal drugs. and fires combined. so if we are serious about doing something about improving the health of americans. we should try to make every effort to entice americans  to take up smoking and. if they are smokers. to cease smoking. here are the figures: tobacco kills 418.000 americans every year by tobaccorelated diseases. alcohol is 105.000. about onefourth of the deaths result from tobacco and fires. 4.300. illegal drugs. 9.000. and so forth. so you add them all together. and they dont amount to the figures that are causing the deaths resulting from tobaccorelated diseases. where is the problem. the problem lies in that every day it is estimated in the united states of america 3.000 children and young people start smoking in schoolyards. or wherever it might be. in our country. every day. 3.000 youngsters take up smoking. and onethird of these will die prematurely as a result of that habit. in other words. if they smoke. the chances are that about 33 percent will die prematurely because of the habit of smoking. each year. 1 million additional children3.000 a day times 365 gets you very close to 1 million1 million additional children become smokers. what we are aiming for in this legislation is to prevent that and reduce the number of children who take up smoking. there are those who say. "oh. well. tobacco use is a matter of personal choice." but is this true when you are talking about young people. impressionable children. 14. 15. 16. 17. in their teens. ninety percent of those who take up smoking do so before the age of 18. in other words. if you can get someone by the age of 18 without having taken up smoking. the chances are excellent that individual will  become a smoker. ninety percent of smokers have taken it up before the age of 18. children obviously dont possess the same level of maturity as adults. they cant be expected to make the most thoughtful decisions on this lifeanddeath matter of smoking. sometimes it is the "cool" thing to do. apparently. but the tobacco industry itself. in its own wordshere is the internal document from r.j. reyds. "if a man"or woman-"has never smoked by the age of 18. the odds are threetoone he never will." if you havent smoked by 18. the chances are pretty good that you wont smoke ever-"threetoone." by the age of 24. if you can hold off and  smoke at the age of 24. the odds "are 20toone" that that individual you will  take up smoking. that is where we want to concentrate our effortson these young people in their early teensand carry it up through the age of 24 when the chances are very. very good that an individual will  take up smoking. but the key group is 18 or younger. is there an epidemic of smoking amongst young people. you bet your life there is. in my home state. where i never thought there was a particular abundance of smokingit is  going like going to china. where everybody seems to be smoking. that doesnt seem to be true in my state. yet the centers for disease control say that 37 percent of high school childreni am  talking about high school seniors. i am talking about high school children. that would be the 12th. l1th. and 10th. and in some instances the 9th gradesmoke. that is more than 70.000 teen smokers in our state. we have 1 million people in our state. and 70.000 teen smokers. onethird of these high school students. will lose their lives prematurely because of this unhealthy habit. here is a graph that shows the increase in the rates of smoking among high school seniors.  we are talking seniors. it is remarkable. it went along pretty steadily at about 30 percent. then in 1982 it even dipped down to about 27 percent. then it shot up starting at about 1991. up until the middle 30s nationally. what has caused all of this. one of the things. obviously. that has caused it is the action of advertising to these young people. whether it is the marlboro man. or joe camel. or whatever it is. all the advertising from the tobacco companies has been oriented toward inducing the young people to take up smoking. it is the "in thing." they want to make it the "in thing." the tobacco companies clearly do. one of the ironies of the opposition of the tobacco companies to the mccain bill is the suggestion that this bill was somehow dreamed up by a bunch of washington bureaucrats. the fact of the matter is that most of the provisions in this bill have their origins in the global settlement the industry entered into with the 40 states attorneys general last june. in other words. about a year ago the tobacco industry entered into a deal with 40 of the attorneys general from our 50 states. in that. they made a whole series of concessions. it had hing to do with washington. dc. or washington bureaucrats. or taxandspend liberals in the u.s. congress. it was all initiated and agreed to by the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. lets tackle some of the things that came up in that agreement. what about the idea of a perpack tax on cigarettes to discourage teenagers from smoking. in other words. what is the idea of increasing the tax. or fee. if you will. on each package of cigarettes that is sold in order to discourage teenagers from taking up smoking. tobacco companies signed on to a 65centsperpack increase during the settlement negotiations. sixtyfive cents they agreed to. that had hing to do with washington. dc. that was out in the hinterlands. out in the states. working with the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. what about financial penalties on the tobacco companies for failure to meet the annual youth smoking reduction target. this is the socalled lookback provision. if there isnt a reduction of x percentthis is written out in the contract. in the dealif those reductions arent achieved by 40 percent or 50 percent. whatever it might be. by such and such number of years. then the tobacco companies will have to pay an additional penalty. that is the socalled lookback provision at the end. at the end of 5 years of this deal. you look back and see if there has been this percentage reduction in teenage smoking. where did that come from. out of the bureaucrats in washington.  at all. the tobacco companies agreed to this during the settlement with the attorneys general. what about advertising and marketing restrictions. the industry signed off on that. what about receipts from those new taxes to fund public health programs such as counteradvertising. cessation of smoking efforts. communitybased antismoking programs. and all of these things that we are  thinking are wise to reduce smoking in the united states just to get people to  take it up in the beginning. to help those who are smoking cease that very dangerous habit. where did that come from. did that come from washington bureaucrats.  at all. the industry agreed to it in their dealings with the attorneys general. the fact is. the mccain legislation is based largely on the negotiations which produced the socalled global settlement. comprehensive settlement. last june. given the american publics distaste for new taxes. it is  surprising that the tobacco industry has seized upon the $1.10 increase in the price for a pack of cigarettes and has used this as a rallying cry of opposition. lets understand this. who is going to pay this tax. only people who smoke. if they give up smoking. they wont pay the tax. anybody who says -they dont like the tax. quit smoking and they wont have to pay a nickel of it. obviously. smokers are free to go on smoking. but i think we all ought to understand that all of us are paying when there are smokers in our society. why are they paying. because onethird of those smokers are going to suffer very severe sickness and illness as a result of their smoking. and the direct health care costsin other words. whether medicaid. medicare. or other forms of assistance to those who smoke. or are suffering from smokingrelated illnessesare paid for by all of us in society. it costs $60 billion a year to care for those individuals. and when you take the lost productivity and the disability payments. it is estimated that smokingrelated illnesses are causing american taxpayers over $100 billion a year. . even for somebody from washington. $100 billion is a lot of money. that is what these tobaccocaused illnesses are costing the taxpayers in the united states. madam president. i urge members of this body and the public also to look closely at the facts i have enunciated here and  to be dissuaded from doing the right thing.  to be dissuaded by this blitz from the tobacco industry and the lobbying that is taking place. s. 1415. the mccain bill. is a comprehensive bill. it is a good bill and addresses a very serious problem in our country. the time for action on it is . and i hope my colleagues will support efforts to pass the legislation. madam president. seeing one else wishing to speak. i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. without this amendment manyof the clean water state revolving loan fund programs would face severe financial hardship that would be detrimental to the health of the revolving loan fund program. once again. i would like to thank senators bond and mikulski for including this very important amendment in their managers package. fema
madam president. the conference report before the senate includes the tea 21. that is the transportation efficiency act of the 21st century. which some call the istea ii restoration act. it includes a technical corrections measure to that bill. the technical correction measure. which is part of the legislation before us. remedies errors made in h.r. 2400. which was the surface transportation bill we passed just before the memorial day recess. as everyone ks. just before we went out on that break for memorial day. there was a great desire to complete the legislation before us. we completed negotiations on thursday evening and delivered a very complex bill that had over 900 pages the first thing on friday morning. in other words. we completed the negotiations on thursday night. and by the next morning we had a bill of over 900 pages before us. inevitably. some errors were made. we have before us legislation to correct those errors. i emphasize this is just a technical corrections bill. many members have come to us in the ensuing days suggesting new items or changes that they wanted to be made because they felt in the original legislation they did  obtain them. but we resisted all such requests. this bill merely carries out the agreements of that conference on h.r. 2400. i will refer to it sometimes by the number. that is the original transportation legislation that we passed. the technical corrections in the legislation before us have been developed jointly by the house and the senate conferees. with valuable input from the u.s. department of transportation. i think it is important to e this legislation before us does  change the formula allocations agreed to in the conference. the technical changes in this legislation relate to apportionments. those that exist are made to ensure that the legislative instructions to the department of transportation on the formula will produce an apportionment to the states just as we agreed upon. in other words. the only changes we made in this legislation. socalled technical corrections. are to take care of things that were left out inadvertently or to clarify an intent that was there and clearly recognized in order to carry out that intent. this bill also corrects drafting errors relating to veterans smokingrelated disability benefits. this is to what the senator from west virginia was referring. the provisions of h.r. 2400 were intended merely to reverse a recent decision by the general counsel of the veterans administration. which decision had  yet been implemented. it is very important to remember that. we have been advised that the bill may be interpreted to deny benefits to some veterans who were eligible for benefits prior to the general counsels decision. in other words. it has come to our attention there may be situations that have arisen that. as a result of the language as we drew it. denied benefits to some veterans who were receiving them. what we meant to do was to reverse the general counsels decision as it might apply to future applicants in an entirely new category of benefits opened by the general counsel. and with this technical corrections bill. we reach that objective. there was an article in the washington post several weeks ago that has caused serious concern. that article suggested that congress had declared smoking "willful misconduct" by americas veterans. that was just plain wrong. that statement in the washington post. that we included smoking as "willful misconduct" by american veterans. gave great offense to some. i want everyone to k that was an incorrect reading of the legislation. section 1110 of title 38. which is the existing law and has hing to do with the transportation legislation. entitled veterans to compensation if they are disabled by servicerelated illness or injury. there are two exceptions to this entitlement in current law. the first exception is "willful misconduct." a veteran can get disability compensation if the illness or injury results from willful misconduct. that is the law. it has been the law a long time. the second exception denies benefits if the illness or injury resulted from alcohol or drugs. these two exceptions are in the current law. that is where they are. . h.r. 2400. the transportation legislation. added a third exception. it would have denied benefits where the illness results from smoking. this did  make smoking willful misconduct. this was a third exception to the provision that entitles a veteran to disability benefits. the first was willful misconduct. the second was alcohol or drugs. and the third was smoking related. from where did we get that language. that was suggested by the senate legislative counsel as the most straightforward means to reverse the great opening of benefits under the general counsels decision. this language had the unintended consequence of denying benefits to some veterans who would have qualified prior to the decision. this bill drops the language suggested by the senate legislative counsel. we just got away from all that language that we had in there and returned to the language which was suggested by the administration. which reverses the general counsels decision as it might apply to future applicants. veteran  entitled to benefits as a result of adjudication. or who has applied for such benefits. will be affected. this bill makes the following changes to the veterans subtitle: one. it clarifies that veterans who file claims for smokingrelated benefits are grandfathered. that filing isnt going to be eliminated. second. it makes clear that those activeduty service personnel who contracted a smokingrelated illness while in the service continue to qualify for disability compensation. we dont change that. third. we ensure that survivors and their dependents will receive a 20percent increase in education assistance benefits. madam president. we prepared a summary of this technical corrections bill. and i ask unanimous consent that this summary be printed in the record after my remarks.
yes. i would be happy to. the dwsrf is to be used to assist pubiic water systems to finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. public water systems that regularly serve at least 25 yearround residents or have a least 15 service connections qualify for assistance. the dwsrf may be used if it will significantly further the public health objectives of the act. we recognize that there are a few communities that are currently serviced by wells that are contaminated. and the best way to solve the existing public health problems intended to be addressed by the act may be to create a federally regulated public water system.
. this is a national disaster. there are 192 million firearms192 million firearmsin the possession of private citizens in our nation. and 35 percent of american homes contain at least one gun. each year. more than 500 children accidentally shoot themselves or a sibling. a family member. with a family gun. according to the centers for disease control. the firearmsrelated death rate. for american children under the age of 15i mean. i think it is important we realize what we are talking about here. these youngsters are under 15. the rate in the united states for the death rate of these children through guns is 12 times higher than that of the other 25 industrialized nations combined. one thing is certain. it is simply too easy for children to get a gun. at the very least. adults should be encouraged to store their guns in a manner and a place that is inaccessible to children. if they dont. and if the child uses the gun to harm himself or someone else. the adult should be held responsible. i find it hard to argue with that premise. as i say. if there is a pit bull. one would argue a bit that the pit bull should be chained up. we have seen incidentscertainly. i have seen them in my statewhere they are  chained and they maul some youngster terribly. the owner of that dog. that pit bull. is held responsible. and the owner of a gun that is far more dangerous than that pit bull should likewise be held responsible. are we embarking on something radical here. something that is unacceptable by the public. in april. an nbc/wall street journal poll was takena bipartisan poll by peter hart and bob teeter. whom most of us k. we k bob teeter. we have worked with him. others on the other side have worked with peter hart. this is the question: congress is considering legislation that holds adults criminally responsible if they allow young children to have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill aher person. do you favor or oppose this legislation. that was the question. you are going to hold adults criminally responsible if young children have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill aher. the answer was 75 percent said they favored this type of legislation. 21 percent said they opposed it. and 4 percent were undecided. it seems to me that it is time that we in congress caught up with the american people on this issue. here is an opportunity to encourage gun owners to act responsibly by keeping their weapons out of the reach of children. this amendment does  prevent anybody from owning a gun. that is a red herring. if anybody suggests that. it says if you are a gun owner who has reason to expect a child to be on the premises. you must store your gun safely. i dont think the national rifle association would object to that. certainly. it seems to me. they would encourage people to store their weapons safely. if they failed to store them safe: ly. and a child uses it to harm himself. or someone else. the gun owner can be held criminally liable. that makes total common sense to me. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense approach to gun safety. i thank my cosponsor who worked so hard on this. and i thank the chair.
 signed into law bipartisan legislation that provides greater portability of health insurance for working americans. today. i join with my colleagues. senator rockefeller. senator frist. senator jeffords. and senator collins. in the introduction of a bipartisan bill that will provide some of the same guarantees for medicare beneficiaries who buy medicare supplemental insurance or medigap policies. of the 38 million medicare beneficiaries. about 80 percent. or 31 million. have some form of medicare supplemental insurance. whether covered through an employersponsored health plan. medicaid or aher public program. or a private medigap policy. our bill does several important things for medicare beneficiaries who have had continuous coverage: first. it guarantees that if their plan goes out of business or the beneficiary moves out of a plan service area. he or she can buy aher comparable policy. these rules also would apply to a senior who has had coverage under a retiree health plan or medicare select if their plan goes out of business. second. it encourages beneficiaries to enroll in medicare managed care by guaranteeing that they can return to medicare feeforservice and. during the first year of enrollment. get back their same medigap policy if they decide they do  like managed care. under current law. if a senior wishes to enroll in a medicare managed care plan. he or she has two options. the medigap policy may be dropped if the senior chooses a managed care program. or the individual can continue to pay medigay premiums in the event that the policy is needed again some daya very costly option for those on fixed incomes. many seniors fear that if they lose their supplemental policy after entering a managed care plan. it may be financially impossible for them to reenroll in medigap. third. it bans preexisting condition exclusion periods for medicare beneficiaries who obtain medigap policies when they are first eligible for medicare. under current law. any time insurers sell a medigap policy. they can limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health conditions for a 6month period. fourth. it establishes a guaranteed open enrollment period for those under 65 who become medicare beneficiaries because they are disabled. under current federal law. medicare beneficiaries are offered a 6month open enrollment period only if they are 65. there are approximately 5 million americans who are under 65 years of age and are enrolled in the medicare program. currently. they do  have access to medigap policies unless state laws require insurers to offer policies to them. our bill provides for a onetime open enrollment period for the current medicare disabled. which will guarantee access to all medigap plan options for almost 5 million disabled americans. it is true that this bill does  go as far as some would like. our bill leaves to the states more controversial issues. such as continuous open enrollment and community rating of medigap premiums. i believe. however. that this legislation will provide seniors similar guarantees to those that we provided to working americans under the kassebaumkennedy legislation.
. i am very pleased today to introduce legislation to provide health insurance for millions of children who are  currently covered. before i talk about the bill. let me take a moment to thank all of the members of the bipartisan coalition who have worked so hard to put this legislation together. senator rockefeller. the lead democratic cosponsor and my colleague on the finance committee. deserves very special mention in this regard. senator rockefeller has worked for many. many years on these issues and i am personally grateful for all his leadership and hard work in this endeavor. he is a true hero when it comes to americas children. there are currently 10 million children in this country who do  have health insurance. many of these children li in families where one or both parents are working but do  have employee coverage and earn too much to qualify for medicaid. others. though eligible. simply fall through the cracks. while still others lose eligibility because of agebased restrictionsg. this is a tragic problem and our proposal tries to provide real solutions. the chafeerockefeller proposal offers the states additional federal matching funds if they choose to provide medicaid coverage to all children up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level. it is a completely voluntary programwe hope that all states will participate. but we leave that decision to the govers. states. like rhode island. that are already providing coverage at these levels will immediately begin to get additional federal matching funds once they have provided the 1year continuous coverage. our bill also provides grant funds for states to use for outreach to the 3 million children who are eligible for medicaid but  enrolled. i believe that the medicaid program is the best avenue to reach these uninsured children. expansions in the medicaid program over the years have done wonders in increasing coverage for children and pregnant women. we also have to keep an eye on cost. and medicaid is an inexpensive way to cover childrenwhile half of medicaid beneie s3849 ficiaries are children. children only account for 15 percent of overall medicaid spending. and medicaid is a program that already exists. so we dont have to create a new program or a new bureaucracy. in short. medicaid works and works well. by encouraging states to provide medicaid coverage to all children under 18 up to 150 percent of poverty. our proposal also tries to fix one of the programs problems: under the current medicaid program a childs eligibility depends  only on family income. but also on age. let me illustrate this for you: a 6yearold girl lives in a family of four whose annual income is $21.000. that little girl gets medicaid because federal law requires that all children 6 and under be covered up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. on her seventh birthday. that little girl doesnt get much of a birthday presentshe loses her medicaid coverage because federal law only requires that children between the ages of 7 and 13 be covered up to 100 percent of poverty. and her familys income level is slightly above that level. her 4yearold brother. however. keeps his medicaid coverage. at least for the next 2 years. how bizarre that there are two children in the same family and one gets coverage because hes under 6 and the other doesnt because shes older than 6. our proposal would give states the option to continue medicaid coverage for both children until they are 18. so. i am very pleased to introduce this legislation today along with this distinguished bipartisan group of senators. i look forward to working together toward the goal of getting critical health care coverage to these children.
 to extend mostfavorednation. or mal trading relations. status to china on a permanent basis. since 1989. congress has engaged in an annual. and very public. debate about the extension of mfn to chiria. these debates have been highly charged. but over the years. the repetition of this debate has carried a heavy price tag. with little to positive results to show for it. in fact. the constant debate as to whether or  the united states should continue mal trade relations with china has come at great expense to the overall health of the bilateral relationship between these two great and powerful nations. and that. in turn. has had realand negativerepercussions for the united states. its citizens. and even the chinese people themselves. we need to look toward a day where this annual mfn rollercoaster will be replaced by a stable. longterm ecoic foundation between these two superpowers. it is toward that end that we are introducing this legislation.
. i intend to vote for the hatchkennedy amendment. it is paid for by a 43centperpack increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes. we must do everything we can to discourage smoking and to advance good health policy. in my view. this does both. however. in doing so. i want to be very clear about my order of priorities in terms of addressing the childrens health crisis in this country. if the hatchkennedy amendment fails. and we do  get any additional spending for childrens health initiatives above and beyond the $16.8 billion already included in this budget resolution. i intend to place all of my energies behind strengthening the very cornerstone of our federal efforts to provide health insurance to poor childrenthe medicaid program. my first priority will be to work in the finanqe committee to enact the chafeerockefellerjeffordsbreaux bill which provide incentives-- mandates--to encourage states to expand their medicaid programs to cover all children aged 18 and under. up to 150 percent of poverty. through this voluntary medicaid expansion. which  has the support of a majority of the members of the senate finance committee. we can strengthen the system already in place across the country to reach up to 5 million more children. this is the most costeffective way to proceed. does  create any new entitlement programs. and is a kn quantity in every state. what am i saying here. let us strengthen the foundation before we build the building. in an environment of scarce resources. we must first work to reach the very neediest children through the medicaid progran before we create other programs with potentially overlapping objectives. i would have a very different view if we had unlimited resources. but we do . i would  like to recognize senators rockefeller and jeffords to get an indication of their priorities.
. we have worked very hard to ensure that this legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of medicaid beneficiaries and the managed care companies. i want to thank senators breaux and kerrey who helped craft this legislation and are original cosponsors. i also want to thank the many advocacy organizations for their input and support. and i also want to thank some of the managed care organizations who worked with us. i am especially pleased that some of these organizations. such as the hmo group which is an alliance of health maintenance organizations have endorsed this legislation. their support is critical to the success of medicaid managed care. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included in the record.
. we are facing an emergency here. this legislation. which came from the finance committee. proposes to do something about it. what is the situation. in 1950. which is 47 years ago. there were 16 workers for every retiree16 workers in the united states paying* into the hospital insurance fund and paying into social security.
as i said. 47 years ago. in 1950. there were 16 workers for every retiree. today. there are 3 workers for every retiree 16. but 3. twentyeight years from . in the year 2025. the ratio will fall to two workers for every retiree. so something has to be done if this medicare trust fund is going to survive. what we have proposed ii increasing the medicare eligibility age to conform with that of social security. in 1983. we raised the age of social security eligibility gradually. it comes into full force in the year 2025. by the year 2025. the retirement age will be 67.  the 65 that it is today. we have proposed that the medicare program step up in similar fashion. the key thing. . is to take these actions . dont wait until the baby boomers are all there collecting .and we cant do anything about it. . if we act. we can take these very gradual steps. for example. the first step will be in 2003. 6 years from . when the eligibility age for social security and medicare will go from 65 to 65 and 2 months. then it goes up to 65 and 10 months by the year 2007. then we take a break for 11 yearsexcuse me: in 2008. it will be at age 66. and then gradually it goes up by 2 months and 4 months and 6 months until the year 2025. when the retirement age for social security-
social security is already set. that goes to 67. we did that in 1983. that goes to age 67 in 2025. what we do in this program is to have medicare conform to that. . this is a very wise provision that we did. in a bipartisan manner. in the finance committee. and i certainly hope that it will withstand any attacks. i thank the chair and i thank the distinguished chairman of our committee.
. there are some saying. "oh. you are giving them a cadillac package." it is just  so. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a comparison between what medicaid provides. which some could say is a cadillac package. and what we have in here. which we provide. which is just what the blue cross provides. you can see as you look down the list that blue cross does  cover shoes and corrective devices. transportation to medical services. family counseling. hearing care or vision care. so we go with the blue cross package with the exception of adding vision care and hearing assistance.
i would like to address this. . if i might. to the distinguished chairman of the finance committee. it is also my understanding that a state would be able to use any new funds to provide health coverage for children under 200 percent of poverty and use existing state dollars. mally used for this purpose. in order to provide health care coverage for children over 200 percent of poverty.
. as well as democratic party leaders. to disavow and distance themselves from candidates who resort to mediscare demagoguery in their future political campaigns. the american people deserve a responsible debate on this difficult subject. and the centrist coalition will be working to see that this happens. this bill does include a number of helpful changes for medicare beneficiaries. lowincome children. and legal immigrants which i would like to briefly highlight. medigap provisions included in this bill. which i was pleased to author earlier this year. will do for medicare beneficiaries much of what the kassebaumkennedy health insurance bill did for working americans: it vastly improves portability and bans preexisting condition limitations for medigap policy holders. this bill also improves access to emergency services for medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. which is derived from legislation senator graham authored and i was glad to cosponsor earlier this year. this provision establishes a prudent layperson definition of emergency medical conditions to ensure that emergency services are properly covered. this legislation also includes expanded preventive health care benefits for medicare enrollees. including mammography. colorectal and prostate cancer screening. testing for osteoporosis. and improved coverage for diabetes and other important prevention measures. these enhanced services will be helpful to the more than 174.000 medicare beneficiaries in rhode island. one of my most important priorities. that of expanding access to health insurance for lowincome children. is also addressed in this bill. i am especially pleased that we are providing $24 billion for this purpose. this is a critical step forward for rhode islands children. 19 percent of whom live in poverty. many of these poor children38 percentlive in families where at least one parent is working. yet they are still poor. these funds are targeted to help these families especially. while i would have preferred greater specificity in terms of the benefits to be provided to children under this program. the final package is a significant improvement over some of the earlier proposals. i want to thank and ackledge senator rockefeller for his leadership and expertise in working to advance the cause for childrens health insurance. he was a strong partner in helping to make this a stronger and better program than it otherwise would have been. i also want to thank senator roth for helping me to ensure that rhode island can take full advantage of the funding provided under this program to continue its childrens health initiatives. the finance committee chairman was very responsive to the problems this legislation posed for states. like rhode island. that have already expanded coverage. we were able to work together to ensure that rhode island will  be penalized for choosing to expand coverage on its own. this bill also gives states critical new flexibility by allowing them to enroll medicaid beneficiaries into managed care without obtaining a waiver from the department of health and human services. at the same time. the legislation includes important safeguards for these beneficiaries. many of which were contained in legislation i introduced earlier this year. for example. disabled children. children in foster care and special needs children who have been adopted are protected from mandatory enrollment in managed care. women enrolled in medicaid managed care programs will continue to have the freedom to choose their family planning provider. even if that provider is  part of their managed care plan. this bill also restores medicaid coverage to thousands of children who were removed from the ssi rolls as a result of eligibility changes made in the 1996 welfare reform law. this will be emously helpful to many lowincome families whose children may longer be considered statutorily disabled but who nevertheless have significant special health care needs. let me take a moment to describe the provisions of this bill dealing with legal immigrants. as my colleagues k. the 1996 welfare reform law placed severe restrictions on the federal benefits that legal immigrants may receive. among these restrictions was a complete and immediate cutoff of supplemental security income [ssi] and food stamp benefits.  only for future immigrants but for those already in this country legally. for the elderly and disabled legal immigrants who last august were in the united states--including nearly 4.000 in my own state of rhode islandthe new ssi ban represented hing short of a crisis. for many. the loss of this critical federal aid would mean losing the ability to live independently. in turn. this would present a serious community and fiscal challenge to state and local governments. as immigrants who had lost benefits and faced destitution turned to nursing homes or other costly facilities for support. i was sorely troubled by these restrictions on immigrants. and pledged to do what i could to mitigate the most harsh of these during this congress. i am delighted to say that in this regard. we have been successful. the conference report before us  is identical to the senatepassed bill on which i and others of my colleagues worked very hard. it restores benefits to those legal immigrants who were receiving ssi as of last august. it also allows immigrants who were in the united states last august and who may become .disabled in the future to receive ssi. for my state. this means that 3.753 currently elderly and disabled rhode island residents--and many others who may become disabled in the futurewill be able to receive basic ssi assistance to allow them to live with dignity. . the immigrant provisions of this bill are  perfect. and i am disappointed that it does  contain the chafeegraham amendment on legal immigrant children and medicaid. or the provision dealing with ssi for those too disabled to naturalize. but the bill before us goes a long way toward restoring fair treatment for the thousands of legal. taxpaying immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when welfare reform was enacted. i want to commend senators damato. feinstein. dewine. and graham for all of their hard work in helping to solve this problem. since the introduction of our fairness for legal immigrants act in april. we have been working as a united team toward fair treatment for legal immigrants. with passage of this bill. our efforts will have met with success. in closing. i am hopeful that we can build upon the bipartisanship that was necessary to make this bill a reality when we turn to the more challenging task of advancing longterm budget and entitlement reforms in the future. i particularly want to address the entitlement reforms i strongly believe are necessary for medicare. although the provisions we worked hard onmeans testing the part b premium. increasing the age of eligibility from 65 to 67. the $5 home health care copayment--were dropped in the final package. etheless. i think it behooves all of us to continue our work on each of these measures. and certainly i will do everything i can to advance them. i thank the chair.
i would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank and ackledge the tremendous work of the senator from louisiana in connection with the medicare reforms that we undertook. one was a stouter soul in that effort to face up to what had to be done if we are going to continue to have medicare. it was the senator from louisiana who joined in leading the effort. in having the means testing in the part b premium and raising the eligibility age to 67 and having a copayment. a payment for the home health care visits. of 7 percent. i share the disappointment that the senator from louisiana has voiced in that these elements we worked on did  survive. but i see others here. the distinguished senator from new york was right in the lead in these efforts. all i can say is. disappointed though we were. despite the overwhelming vote that took place on the floor of the senate on both the means testing and the raising of the eligibility age. up or down votes--one got 70 votes. the means testing. 70 to 30. and the other got something like 62 to 38. in that neighborhood. over 60 votes. in raising the age to 67they didnt survive the conference because of objections from the other body. but this is what i want to say. . disappointed though we might be in those particular facts. those particular undertakings. etheless we have made some substantial achievements in having them so accepted here.
. i ask unanimous consent that the senate committee on indian affairs be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. october 8. 1997. at 9:30 a.m.. in room 485 of the russell senate building to conduct an oversight hearing on the indian provisions contained in the tobacco settlement between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry.
. i am pleased to support the ination of. dr. david satcher for u.s. surgeon general and assistant secretary for health. i have examined his qualifications and achievements. and i believe he has the capacity to serve this country well in the important role of the nations top physician. on tuesday of this week. i. along with senators graham and jeffords and representatives moran and leach. annced the formation- of the congressional prevention coalition. former surgeon general c. everett koop was kind egh to join us at the press conference. during the course of his remarks. it struck me how greatly we have missed having a national spokesperson on health issues the past three years. dr. koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use. lack of exercise. and poor diet. he didnt pull any punches--he gave a stern lecture to all of those present on the dangers inherent in the socalled couch potato lifestyle. i have reviewed dr. satchers statements before the senate labor committee. and he clearly is anxious to start in along the same lines. at his confirmation hearing. dr. satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. as he put it. "whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets. i want to send the message of good health to the american people." and i was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities in this role would be to put the health of our childen and grandchildren in the national spotlight. to my view. all of these matters fall directly within the job description of a u.s. surgeon general. as i said. we have been without a surgeon general for three years a period of time when we have been confronted with a staggering array of public health issues. the need for a surgeon general has never been greater. as we are seeing an increase in smoking among high school seniors. widespread substance abuse. continuing struggles with aids. and a startling rate of obesity among youngsters. and as we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research. i k that i. for one. would benefit from the perspective that a surgeon general could bring to this issue. several of my colleagues have expressed their misgivings about this ination. some have raised concerns about .dr. satchers views on late term abortions. others have questioned his role in a series of azt trials that were conducted in africa. as senator jeffords. the chairman of labor committee. and senator frist. the chairman of the public health and safety subcommittee. stated during the debate on the ination yesterday. however. these are  new charges. indeed. each of these issues was raised by the committee during dr. satchers confirmation hearing. and its my understanding that he responded satisfactorily. indeed. his answers on these and other matters have been available to all senators and the american people for some months  via the internet. dr. satchers participation in many aspects of the health care systemprovider. scientist. public and private administratorgive him the extensive kledge and experience necessaryr to fulfill his role as the u.s. surgeon general. he has dedicated his career to improving public health. i urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of dr. satchers ination.
madam president. last week i put into the record a statement expressing my support for the ination of dr. david satcher for u.s. surgeon general and assistant secretary for health. as i indicated then. i believe in his qualifications and achievements. and think he would serve well as the nations top physician. dr. satcher has excelled in many aspects of the health care system. he has been a provider. a scientist. a teacher. an administrator. in both the private and the public sector. i must say i was impressed that the american college of physicians. which is a very prestigious organization. awarded dr. satcher its james d. bruce memorial award for distinguished contributions in preventive medicine. dr. satcher has dedicated his career to improving public health. the united states has been without a surgeon general for a little over 3 years. this is unfortunate. i believe. just last week. dr. c. everett koop. former surgeon general of the united states. spoke at a press conference which i had the privilege of attending. in that press conference dr. koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use. lack of exercise. and poor diet. he did  pull any punches. he gave a stern lecture to all those who were present and hopefully beyond that. about the dangers in america to american young people and to all our citizens from the socalled couch potato lifestyle. i have reviewed the statements that dr. satcher has made before the senate labor committee and he is clearly anxious to follow in the footsteps of dr. koop and his successor. antonia ello. at his confirmation hearing dr. satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. this is what he said: "whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets. i want to send the message of good health to the american people." so i was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities would be to put the health of our children and our grandchildren in the national spotlight. all of these matters fall directly within the job description of a u.s. surgeon general. i might say. it seems to me what we are concerned with. madam president. is  just extending the life expectancy of americans. it is beyond that. we want to have americans in good health as they proceed in their elder years. and throughout all their lives. in other words. its what they call the quality of their lives that we are concerned with. it is  just living longer. its that they be healthy and be able to construct a healthy life and a happy one. where they feel good about themselves. . in the period we have gone without a surgeon general. we have been confronted with a host of tough public health issues. i believe the need for a surgeon general has never been greater. wehave these problems in my home state of a very substantial percentage. something like 27 percent. of our seniors in high school smoke. this is on the increase.  just in my state but throughout the nation. we have seen widespread substance abuse. and continued struggle with aids. and a startling rate of obesity amongst our youngsters. they just dont get out there and exercise. as we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research. i for one would benefit from the perspective that a surgeon general would bring to this issue several of my colleagues have ex- pressed misgivings about this ination. some have raised concerns about dr. satchers views on lateterm abortions. others have questioned his role in a series of azt trials that have been conducted in africa. i just heard the distinguished senator from missouri talk about concerns about the free needle exchange. or needle exchange program. as senator jeffords. the chairman of the labor committee. and senator frist. the chairman of the public health and safety subcommittee. stated during the debate on the ination last week. these are  new charges. i am  familiar with the needle exchange that was just being discussed here before. but apparently the azt trials and the lateterm abortion matters were thoroughly discussed in the committee and subcommittee. each of these issues was raised by the committee during dr. satchers confirmation and it is my understanding he responded satisfactorily--satisfactorily to the committee. they reported out the ination. indeed. his answers on those and other -matters have been available for all senators and the american people to view. so i want to say i am pleased that we have the ination for a new surgeon general before us. i applaud the majority leader for recognizing the importance of this post and moving the senate forward on this matter. so i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture and in favor of dr. satchers ination. madam president. i suggest the absence of a quorum.
madam president. this is what we might call a repeat offenders amendment. i filed it last friday so that our members would have a chance. and their staffs. to look at it and consider it. the amendment would strengthen and clarify the repeat drunk driving offenders section of the bill. that is. the underlying bill. the bill. as currently drafted. requires states to act and support penalties for drunk drivers who have a blood alcohol concentration of .15 or greater. and two things have to occurthe drunk driver is arrested. has a blood alcohol content of .15 or greater. and has been convicted of a second or third or more drunk driving offense within 5 years. this amendment. of which senator dewine is the lead sponsor. is cosponsored by senator lautenberg. senator warner. senator chafee. senator baucus. and senator dorgan. and what it does. it strikes the reference to the .15 blood alcohol concentration and lets the state law on blood alcohol concentration determine what is a "repeat offender." the amendment. therefore. clarifies that a person who is arrested for driving with a blood alcohol concentration level lower than .15. such as .08 or .10. still may be classified as a repeat offender if the state so chooses. so. in essence. madam president. what this amendment does. instead of our setting it at a federal level. we. let the states set the level for the second or greater offense that has occurred within the 5 years.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on agriculture. nutrition. and forestry be allowed to meet during the session of the senate on thursday. march 12. 1998. at 9 an. in sr328a. the purpose of this meeting will be to examine the reauthorization of expiring child nutrition programs.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on labor and human resources. subcommittee on public health and safety. be authorized to meet for a hearing on assessment of new health care techogies role of ahcpr during the session of the senate on thursday. march 12. 1998. at 9:30 a.m.
. over the course of the next month or two. the senate will have the opportunity to debate how best to address the most significant. preventable public health problem confronting this nation today: the scourge of tobacco use by our young people. the senate will face some difficult choices in this regard. the grim statistics about this epidemic. coupled with almost daily revelations of tobacco industry misdeeds. underscore the -need for our earnest action. we can all agree. where adults are concerned personal responsibility must be the rule. tobacco is a legal product and adults are free to make that choice. however. the same level of independent judgment can be said where fourteen yearolds are concerned. bear in mind. only one in ten smokers takes up smoking after the age of eighteen. the remainder start well before that stage. all of usdemocrats and republicans--share a deep and abiding concern about this problem. and a recognition that  is the time for action. however. each of us has different thoughts on how best to attack this problem. the commerce committee draft bill offers a good beginning. but it must be strengthened. senators harkin. graham and. i believe that an aggressive. but responsible approach is essential if we are to be successful in reducing teen tobacco use. this is why the kids act would force the price of cigarettes up by $1.50 over the course of two four. five or sixyears. the price hike must be significant and rapid in order to affect the purchasing behavior of children. the evidence solidly favors that position. simply put. a smaller increase of only $1.10 over a longer period of timein effect 20 cents per year in the commerce committee draftwill  achieve the desired result. as a result of our aggressive approach on price. the kids act would halve teen smoking within just three years. that is also why the kids act contains very stiff socalled lookback" penalties if the industry fails to meet the annual youth reduction targets specified in our bill. unlike the commerce.committee draft. the kids act emphasizes companyspecific penalties to ensure that the companies who do the addicting take the hit. additionally. our annual penalties are capped at $10 billion per year. as opposed to $3.5 billion in the commerce committee draft. these lookback penalties are the very heart of our efforts to curb youth tobacco use. if they miss the mark. the whole program is.the weaker for it. this is also why the kids act provides roughly $5.1 billion per year for antitobacco programs. including counteradvertising. school and communitybased prevention and education. programs. cessation and other initiatives. for those who think this is too much spending. we spend a lot more money on addressing other ills which kill far fewer than 400.000 americans per year. recognizing that the needs of each state are very different. the kids act hands. back -$6 billion per year to the states in recognition of the costs and damages they have incurred in treating tobaccorelated illnesses.. importantly. this funding could be used to meet the particular needs of each state. flexibility is. the key with -respect to the use of this funding. one pool of $3 billion per year could beused to meet any need. the other pool of $3 billion takes the form of a health. human services- and education block grant to meet virtually any humanneed. our bill also includes a state performance bonus pool to help incent and enlist states- in the war against teen tobacco use.- and we need all the stakeholders we can get. as a consequence of these provisions. the national govers association supports the state payment mechanism contained in the kids act. some have pointed out that the draftcommerce committeebill incorporates the cap on annual. liability payments included in our billalthough at $6.5 billion.  $8 billion. my response -is that the cap can be examined in isolatioir from the other parts of the legislation. if. for example. the youth smok. ingprovisions are  as tough as they should be. than i question the appropriateness.of a liability cap. . some people have said our bill is too tough and could. bankrupt the tobacco industry. says who. the tobacco companies. im  sure we can rely upon their representations if- past history is any judge. what about the securities analysts who understand the financial workings of. the tobacco industry. can we rely. upon. these individuals and firms when many of these- samecompanies manage pension. and mutual fund. portfolios with significant investments in tobacco stocks. frankly. i think the only reliable- measure of what the industry can truly afford would be an independent audit an illogical request of an industry which seeks a virtually unprecedented deal with the federal government. the several states and the american people.
. today i am introducing legislation regarding one small aspect of the national tobacco debate. this bill addresses the problem of secondhand smoke. also kn as environmental tobacco smoke. or ets for short. it is my hope that the ideas contained in this bill can be incorporated into any tobacco legislation acted on by the senate. the committee on environment and public works recently held a hearing on ets at which we learned that the principal victims of secondhand smoke are children who live with smokers. tobacco smoke has devastating consequences for children under 18 months of age. annually. up to 15.000 infants are hospitalized for lung infections caused by ets such as bronchitis and pneumonia. these severe lung infections claim the lives of hundreds of children each year. secondhand smoke is also responsible for less severe lung infections in 300.000 infants. 26.000 new cases of asthma among children. millions of middle ear infections. and roughly half the cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids). these preventable illnesses. but 40 percent of children in one multistate study were found to be routinely exposed to tobacco smoke. the bill i am introducing today would assign some of the funds cbllected under any national tobacco settlement approved by congress to a state grant program to educate parents about the dangers of smoking in the home. the statistics i just recited are  widely kn by parents. once aware of the profound risk ets poses for their child. most parents will go to great lengths to protect their child. and i believe that even includes parents who smoke. with the grant funds from this bill. states could provide information about ets to pediatricians and other child care professionals for distribution to parents. states also could develop advertising aimed at parents. we only need to arm parents with information. they will do the rest.
. the evidence is clear. the most effective thing we can do to prevent our children from taking that first deadly cigarette is to increase the price quickly and steeply. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the kennedy amendment. i thank the chair. 3 thank the floor managers.
madam president. i would like to address the question of the national tobacco policy and youth smoking reduction act. s. 1415. this aftern. which the senate is resuming consideration of today. this is a very important bill. and i k the occupant of the chair shares my concerns with this legislation and a concern that it be passed. this seeks to address a serious problemtobacco use among our young people. both conservatives and liberals fault this legislation. some say it is  strong egh. some say it goes too far. i think it strikes an appropriate balance and merits our support. it is  a perfect bill. but i dont think we should let perfection be the enemy of the good. by striving constantly for what each of us wants in the perfect bill. we wont end up with anything. i am concerned about that. madam president. if one counts the mondays and fridays as part of each working week. there are only 68 legislative days remaining in this congressional session before we adjourn for the midterm elections in the fall. sixtyeight days is  very long. time is of the essence if we are going to enact a comprehensive tobacco bill this year. i certainly believe congress should enact such legislation. thus. i am hopeful that. following a vigorous and healthy debate. the senate will pass the mccain bill and send it along to the house. given all the disinformation circulating about this legislationmost of it. i might say. initiated by the tobacco industryi would like to take a few moments of the senates time to review the bidding as to why we are considering national tobacco legislation at this time. the opponents of s. 1415. the socalled mccain bill. would have us believe that this legislation is a case of tax and spend liberalism gone wild. that this bill is an excessive response to a relatively mi social problemthat of tobacco use among the young peopleand that an antitobacco media campaign is all we need. that is an adequate response. well. for years the tobacco industry sought to discredit studies which linked smoking to cancer and other diseases. then the industry told us that nicotine was  addictive.  the industry says it doesnt target kids with any advertising or marketing programs and that this legislation is just aher opportunitythe mccain legislationfor washington to increase taxes on the u.s. public. lets look at the facts. there is indisputable consensus within the public health community that tobacco use constitutes the single most preventable cause of death in this country. in other words. of all the possibilities of reducing deaths in our country. including better exercise. reduction in fat consumption. conducting what we might call a healthful life. all of those things put together arent as effective in improving the health of the united states of america as giving up smoking would be. in other words. it is the single most preventable cause of death. who says that. is it i. senator chafee from rhode island.  at all. it is the centers for disease control. here is a chart. this chart says tobacco kills more americans than alcohol. car accidents. suicides. aids. homicides. illegal drugs. and fires combined. in other words. all the effort we go to in this country to lecture people to use seat belts in order to reduce automobile accidents or fatalities and injuries from automobile accidents. and all we do about counseling in connection with suicides. and the money we pour into aids prevention and attempted cures. and homicides. and the battle against illegal drugs and fires. and all we do to prevent fires from occurring in households. and the lectures on alcoholif you put all of those together. tobacco kills more americans than alcohol. car accidents. suicides. aids. homicides. illegal drugs. and fires combined. so if we are serious about doing something about improving the health of americans. we should try to make every effort to entice americans  to take up smoking and. if they are smokers. to cease smoking. here are the figures: tobacco kills 418.000 americans every year by tobaccorelated diseases. alcohol is 105.000. about onefourth of the deaths result from tobacco and fires. 4.300. illegal drugs. 9.000. and so forth. so you add them all together. and they dont amount to the figures that are causing the deaths resulting from tobaccorelated diseases. where is the problem. the problem lies in that every day it is estimated in the united states of america 3.000 children and young people start smoking in schoolyards. or wherever it might be. in our country. every day. 3.000 youngsters take up smoking. and onethird of these will die prematurely as a result of that habit. in other words. if they smoke. the chances are that about 33 percent will die prematurely because of the habit of smoking. each year. 1 million additional children3.000 a day times 365 gets you very close to 1 million1 million additional children become smokers. what we are aiming for in this legislation is to prevent that and reduce the number of children who take up smoking. there are those who say. "oh. well. tobacco use is a matter of personal choice." but is this true when you are talking about young people. impressionable children. 14. 15. 16. 17. in their teens. ninety percent of those who take up smoking do so before the age of 18. in other words. if you can get someone by the age of 18 without having taken up smoking. the chances are excellent that individual will  become a smoker. ninety percent of smokers have taken it up before the age of 18. children obviously dont possess the same level of maturity as adults. they cant be expected to make the most thoughtful decisions on this lifeanddeath matter of smoking. sometimes it is the "cool" thing to do. apparently. but the tobacco industry itself. in its own wordshere is the internal document from r.j. reyds. "if a man"or woman-"has never smoked by the age of 18. the odds are threetoone he never will." if you havent smoked by 18. the chances are pretty good that you wont smoke ever-"threetoone." by the age of 24. if you can hold off and  smoke at the age of 24. the odds "are 20toone" that that individual you will  take up smoking. that is where we want to concentrate our effortson these young people in their early teensand carry it up through the age of 24 when the chances are very. very good that an individual will  take up smoking. but the key group is 18 or younger. is there an epidemic of smoking amongst young people. you bet your life there is. in my home state. where i never thought there was a particular abundance of smokingit is  going like going to china. where everybody seems to be smoking. that doesnt seem to be true in my state. yet the centers for disease control say that 37 percent of high school childreni am  talking about high school seniors. i am talking about high school children. that would be the 12th. l1th. and 10th. and in some instances the 9th gradesmoke. that is more than 70.000 teen smokers in our state. we have 1 million people in our state. and 70.000 teen smokers. onethird of these high school students. will lose their lives prematurely because of this unhealthy habit. here is a graph that shows the increase in the rates of smoking among high school seniors.  we are talking seniors. it is remarkable. it went along pretty steadily at about 30 percent. then in 1982 it even dipped down to about 27 percent. then it shot up starting at about 1991. up until the middle 30s nationally. what has caused all of this. one of the things. obviously. that has caused it is the action of advertising to these young people. whether it is the marlboro man. or joe camel. or whatever it is. all the advertising from the tobacco companies has been oriented toward inducing the young people to take up smoking. it is the "in thing." they want to make it the "in thing." the tobacco companies clearly do. one of the ironies of the opposition of the tobacco companies to the mccain bill is the suggestion that this bill was somehow dreamed up by a bunch of washington bureaucrats. the fact of the matter is that most of the provisions in this bill have their origins in the global settlement the industry entered into with the 40 states attorneys general last june. in other words. about a year ago the tobacco industry entered into a deal with 40 of the attorneys general from our 50 states. in that. they made a whole series of concessions. it had hing to do with washington. dc. or washington bureaucrats. or taxandspend liberals in the u.s. congress. it was all initiated and agreed to by the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. lets tackle some of the things that came up in that agreement. what about the idea of a perpack tax on cigarettes to discourage teenagers from smoking. in other words. what is the idea of increasing the tax. or fee. if you will. on each package of cigarettes that is sold in order to discourage teenagers from taking up smoking. tobacco companies signed on to a 65centsperpack increase during the settlement negotiations. sixtyfive cents they agreed to. that had hing to do with washington. dc. that was out in the hinterlands. out in the states. working with the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. what about financial penalties on the tobacco companies for failure to meet the annual youth smoking reduction target. this is the socalled lookback provision. if there isnt a reduction of x percentthis is written out in the contract. in the dealif those reductions arent achieved by 40 percent or 50 percent. whatever it might be. by such and such number of years. then the tobacco companies will have to pay an additional penalty. that is the socalled lookback provision at the end. at the end of 5 years of this deal. you look back and see if there has been this percentage reduction in teenage smoking. where did that come from. out of the bureaucrats in washington.  at all. the tobacco companies agreed to this during the settlement with the attorneys general. what about advertising and marketing restrictions. the industry signed off on that. what about receipts from those new taxes to fund public health programs such as counteradvertising. cessation of smoking efforts. communitybased antismoking programs. and all of these things that we are  thinking are wise to reduce smoking in the united states just to get people to  take it up in the beginning. to help those who are smoking cease that very dangerous habit. where did that come from. did that come from washington bureaucrats.  at all. the industry agreed to it in their dealings with the attorneys general. the fact is. the mccain legislation is based largely on the negotiations which produced the socalled global settlement. comprehensive settlement. last june. given the american publics distaste for new taxes. it is  surprising that the tobacco industry has seized upon the $1.10 increase in the price for a pack of cigarettes and has used this as a rallying cry of opposition. lets understand this. who is going to pay this tax. only people who smoke. if they give up smoking. they wont pay the tax. anybody who says -they dont like the tax. quit smoking and they wont have to pay a nickel of it. obviously. smokers are free to go on smoking. but i think we all ought to understand that all of us are paying when there are smokers in our society. why are they paying. because onethird of those smokers are going to suffer very severe sickness and illness as a result of their smoking. and the direct health care costsin other words. whether medicaid. medicare. or other forms of assistance to those who smoke. or are suffering from smokingrelated illnessesare paid for by all of us in society. it costs $60 billion a year to care for those individuals. and when you take the lost productivity and the disability payments. it is estimated that smokingrelated illnesses are causing american taxpayers over $100 billion a year. . even for somebody from washington. $100 billion is a lot of money. that is what these tobaccocaused illnesses are costing the taxpayers in the united states. madam president. i urge members of this body and the public also to look closely at the facts i have enunciated here and  to be dissuaded from doing the right thing.  to be dissuaded by this blitz from the tobacco industry and the lobbying that is taking place. s. 1415. the mccain bill. is a comprehensive bill. it is a good bill and addresses a very serious problem in our country. the time for action on it is . and i hope my colleagues will support efforts to pass the legislation. madam president. seeing one else wishing to speak. i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. without this amendment manyof the clean water state revolving loan fund programs would face severe financial hardship that would be detrimental to the health of the revolving loan fund program. once again. i would like to thank senators bond and mikulski for including this very important amendment in their managers package. fema
madam president. the conference report before the senate includes the tea 21. that is the transportation efficiency act of the 21st century. which some call the istea ii restoration act. it includes a technical corrections measure to that bill. the technical correction measure. which is part of the legislation before us. remedies errors made in h.r. 2400. which was the surface transportation bill we passed just before the memorial day recess. as everyone ks. just before we went out on that break for memorial day. there was a great desire to complete the legislation before us. we completed negotiations on thursday evening and delivered a very complex bill that had over 900 pages the first thing on friday morning. in other words. we completed the negotiations on thursday night. and by the next morning we had a bill of over 900 pages before us. inevitably. some errors were made. we have before us legislation to correct those errors. i emphasize this is just a technical corrections bill. many members have come to us in the ensuing days suggesting new items or changes that they wanted to be made because they felt in the original legislation they did  obtain them. but we resisted all such requests. this bill merely carries out the agreements of that conference on h.r. 2400. i will refer to it sometimes by the number. that is the original transportation legislation that we passed. the technical corrections in the legislation before us have been developed jointly by the house and the senate conferees. with valuable input from the u.s. department of transportation. i think it is important to e this legislation before us does  change the formula allocations agreed to in the conference. the technical changes in this legislation relate to apportionments. those that exist are made to ensure that the legislative instructions to the department of transportation on the formula will produce an apportionment to the states just as we agreed upon. in other words. the only changes we made in this legislation. socalled technical corrections. are to take care of things that were left out inadvertently or to clarify an intent that was there and clearly recognized in order to carry out that intent. this bill also corrects drafting errors relating to veterans smokingrelated disability benefits. this is to what the senator from west virginia was referring. the provisions of h.r. 2400 were intended merely to reverse a recent decision by the general counsel of the veterans administration. which decision had  yet been implemented. it is very important to remember that. we have been advised that the bill may be interpreted to deny benefits to some veterans who were eligible for benefits prior to the general counsels decision. in other words. it has come to our attention there may be situations that have arisen that. as a result of the language as we drew it. denied benefits to some veterans who were receiving them. what we meant to do was to reverse the general counsels decision as it might apply to future applicants in an entirely new category of benefits opened by the general counsel. and with this technical corrections bill. we reach that objective. there was an article in the washington post several weeks ago that has caused serious concern. that article suggested that congress had declared smoking "willful misconduct" by americas veterans. that was just plain wrong. that statement in the washington post. that we included smoking as "willful misconduct" by american veterans. gave great offense to some. i want everyone to k that was an incorrect reading of the legislation. section 1110 of title 38. which is the existing law and has hing to do with the transportation legislation. entitled veterans to compensation if they are disabled by servicerelated illness or injury. there are two exceptions to this entitlement in current law. the first exception is "willful misconduct." a veteran can get disability compensation if the illness or injury results from willful misconduct. that is the law. it has been the law a long time. the second exception denies benefits if the illness or injury resulted from alcohol or drugs. these two exceptions are in the current law. that is where they are. . h.r. 2400. the transportation legislation. added a third exception. it would have denied benefits where the illness results from smoking. this did  make smoking willful misconduct. this was a third exception to the provision that entitles a veteran to disability benefits. the first was willful misconduct. the second was alcohol or drugs. and the third was smoking related. from where did we get that language. that was suggested by the senate legislative counsel as the most straightforward means to reverse the great opening of benefits under the general counsels decision. this language had the unintended consequence of denying benefits to some veterans who would have qualified prior to the decision. this bill drops the language suggested by the senate legislative counsel. we just got away from all that language that we had in there and returned to the language which was suggested by the administration. which reverses the general counsels decision as it might apply to future applicants. veteran  entitled to benefits as a result of adjudication. or who has applied for such benefits. will be affected. this bill makes the following changes to the veterans subtitle: one. it clarifies that veterans who file claims for smokingrelated benefits are grandfathered. that filing isnt going to be eliminated. second. it makes clear that those activeduty service personnel who contracted a smokingrelated illness while in the service continue to qualify for disability compensation. we dont change that. third. we ensure that survivors and their dependents will receive a 20percent increase in education assistance benefits. madam president. we prepared a summary of this technical corrections bill. and i ask unanimous consent that this summary be printed in the record after my remarks.
yes. i would be happy to. the dwsrf is to be used to assist pubiic water systems to finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. public water systems that regularly serve at least 25 yearround residents or have a least 15 service connections qualify for assistance. the dwsrf may be used if it will significantly further the public health objectives of the act. we recognize that there are a few communities that are currently serviced by wells that are contaminated. and the best way to solve the existing public health problems intended to be addressed by the act may be to create a federally regulated public water system.
. this is a national disaster. there are 192 million firearms192 million firearmsin the possession of private citizens in our nation. and 35 percent of american homes contain at least one gun. each year. more than 500 children accidentally shoot themselves or a sibling. a family member. with a family gun. according to the centers for disease control. the firearmsrelated death rate. for american children under the age of 15i mean. i think it is important we realize what we are talking about here. these youngsters are under 15. the rate in the united states for the death rate of these children through guns is 12 times higher than that of the other 25 industrialized nations combined. one thing is certain. it is simply too easy for children to get a gun. at the very least. adults should be encouraged to store their guns in a manner and a place that is inaccessible to children. if they dont. and if the child uses the gun to harm himself or someone else. the adult should be held responsible. i find it hard to argue with that premise. as i say. if there is a pit bull. one would argue a bit that the pit bull should be chained up. we have seen incidentscertainly. i have seen them in my statewhere they are  chained and they maul some youngster terribly. the owner of that dog. that pit bull. is held responsible. and the owner of a gun that is far more dangerous than that pit bull should likewise be held responsible. are we embarking on something radical here. something that is unacceptable by the public. in april. an nbc/wall street journal poll was takena bipartisan poll by peter hart and bob teeter. whom most of us k. we k bob teeter. we have worked with him. others on the other side have worked with peter hart. this is the question: congress is considering legislation that holds adults criminally responsible if they allow young children to have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill aher person. do you favor or oppose this legislation. that was the question. you are going to hold adults criminally responsible if young children have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill aher. the answer was 75 percent said they favored this type of legislation. 21 percent said they opposed it. and 4 percent were undecided. it seems to me that it is time that we in congress caught up with the american people on this issue. here is an opportunity to encourage gun owners to act responsibly by keeping their weapons out of the reach of children. this amendment does  prevent anybody from owning a gun. that is a red herring. if anybody suggests that. it says if you are a gun owner who has reason to expect a child to be on the premises. you must store your gun safely. i dont think the national rifle association would object to that. certainly. it seems to me. they would encourage people to store their weapons safely. if they failed to store them safe: ly. and a child uses it to harm himself. or someone else. the gun owner can be held criminally liable. that makes total common sense to me. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense approach to gun safety. i thank my cosponsor who worked so hard on this. and i thank the chair.
in response to the senator from louisiana. of course. the funds which the senator is going after  are  earmarked for highways at all. they are  earmarked for anything. they go into the general fund. he  wants them earmarked. the alcohol and tobacco taxes earmarked. for highways. will the senator please tell me what the relationship between alcohol and tobacco and the highways is55.000 people are killed on our highways every year. and i can think of a better argument for taking that money and putting it into mass transit. so those people would  be on the highways in the first place. believe me. that would cut down the death rate faster than any highway safety program.
from the taxpayers. the weicker amendment says that one shall participate in the use of the funds prior to 1973. which means that we have to go back to the voters to indicate our stand on this matter. i suspect that someone may come up to me if i were one of the unlucky ones to have voted for the pastore amendment. and he might say to me. "senator. how come i have been out of work for several months. yet the priority of business in the united states senate has been to vote itself campaign funds." or. "senator. how come it is that we can go ahead and have my family taken care of in the way of decent health facilities. when you fellows have a priority on the use of funds for your campaigns." or. "senator. i can move because we do  have a transportation system in this country. but how come it is that you can move so fast as to give yourself funds for a campaign." if i were so unlucky as to vote for the pastore amendment. how would i respond. i might say. "well. it is established  as a fact of life in the united states and we will worry about the criticism later." that seems to be a problem of credibility. i say. let us give some dignity and ho to our profession.
. it is interesting to e that e of the communications i have received were in response to requests by the junior senator from connecticut in relation to this bill. i wish to read one letter which sums up the allencompassing aspects of the problem we are dealing with.  just the mobility.  just the environmental aspect. but the health of all americans. this letter came independently to my office. the letter is from the respiratory disease association in farmington. conn.. and is dated july 17. 1972. the letter reads:
. i appreciate the comments of my colleague from connecticut. senator riicoff. and share his concern for progress in the medical sciences. the work of organizations like the connecticut digestive disease societymultiplied throughout the nationis of emous benefit to the battle against crippling disease. after little more than 3 years of work. cdds is already supplementing governmental funding in the field of gastroenterological research. organizations like cdds direct the life blood of philan-" thropy to help cure the physical. threatsto our wellbeing and happiness. i commend their efforts and appreciate being designated the recipient of their 1974 award.
 right  . i would like to comment. if i might. on the matter of cloture before us because i do  think we should be permitted to allow such a historic occasion to go by uniced. i say historic because this will be the first time in the history of this body that such a rapidfire series of cloture votes came to pass in the number that have occurred here. specifically. we are  about to enter upon the fifth cloture vote. keep in mind. i say historic because never before relative to any other issue have so many "rapidfire" cloture votes taken place.  in the cause of housing. ever.  in the cause of civil rights. ever.  in the cause of health legislation. ever.  in the cause of transportation or job opportunities. ever. a first for the u.s. senate. five rapid fire cloture votes in the name of political greed. pure and simple. amazing that we have never gone through this procedure for all the great causes that have arisen in the land during the course of our 200 years. and especially those that demand solution today. the cutoff came. usually. at three votes. sometimes it went to four. but usually stretching a point at three. and i would say the m is probably two attempts to invoke cloture. but in this particular instance when it is the political ox that is being gored. by whatever side. then we go ahead and go through the exercise of cloture upon cloture upon cloture. i find this to be an extraordinary commentary on our priorities here in the u.s. senate.
. i have reviewed all the major national health insurance programs. the ribicofflong approach makes sense. i am pleased to lend my support to this legislation and will push actively for its adoption during this congress.
i will concede to the senator that which is unique to his resolution. that is. specific prohibitions on income. et cetera. but i think that the senator will have to concede to me that. with respect to precision and total identification. the amendment at the desk far outstrips anything presented by the committee. i am  going to sit here and get into a debate over a particular aspect of the disclosure. but just right across the board there can be any evasion of this disclosure provision because there is hing one can hold back. as a matter of fact. the only concession i made to my colleagues was charitable contributions. they could lump the amount so they could  be harassed by everyone or criticized by everyone for what they did give and did  give. also i conceded medical expenses. which will  have to be specifically identified. those are the only concessions i made. otherwise. our whole life is out there in the altogether as far as finances are concerned before ones constituency. that the senators resolution does  do. it does many things. that it does  do as mine does. by the same token. it is also true. having made that statement as far as i am concerned. i then say let the constituency decide whether something is proper or . there is where we differ.
. although an estimated 8 to 10 million children attend some 10.000 camps each summer. there are uniform national standards governing health and safety conditions at these camps. for almost 12 years my colleague from connecticut. senator ribicoff. has been working to try to provide some meaningful protection for the youngsters who attend summer camps. i have been pleased to serve as a principal cosponsor of senator ribicoffs children and youth camp safety act. yesterday. the senate child and human development subcommittee conducted a hearing on s. 258. the ribicoff youth camp safety bill. and on the overall issue of health and safety conditions at youth camps throughout the country. senator ribicoff appeared as the leadoff witness and i submit his statement to the committee to be printed in the record. the statement follows:
the only message that is being sent to the bureaucracy by whatever amendment is going to be proposed here in a few minutes has hing to do with the regulations on firearms. the only message that is being sent is that we are going to go ahead and cut the law enforcement of the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. why just  propose that the appropriation be cut $3.6 millionthat is very simplewithout any other language. because that is what the senator is doing as it relates to the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. this is . considering the language that has already been obtained by the committee. merely either a reason to go ahead and cut the general appropriation or it is to make certain of our colleagues heroes in the eyes of certain lobbyists. it has hing to do with the threat that was put out there by various bureaucrats in the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. let me read very specifically. first of all. as to what it is that would be cut: the budget cut would affect all activities of the bureau. including its ability to assist state and local criminal investigations. its enforcement of federal revenue laws. and its important regulatory responsibilities in the liquor area. in addition. batf will be forced to eliminate almost twothirds of its technical training. which includes training of state and local police in bombing and firearms investigative techniques. and would have to reduce important aspects of its antiterrorism activities. major illegal firearms investigations would also be adversely affected. what was proposed by the bureau. has hing to do with the regulations whatsoever. aside from the report language. and i do  see how you can be more specific than that. we will  implement these proposals without receiving from congress the funds to do so. i do  k how you can be more specific. so i appreciate the business of sending a message via the appropriations process. indeed. i am trying to do the same thing with some of the agencies right . if i received the type of assurances from the various agencies that i am riding herd on that we received from the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. believe me. i would be totally satisfied. this is very clear cut in what it is that they are promising  to do. so. please understand that when this amendment comes up. if it does. the funds that are being cut are going to have absolutely hing to do with the regulations. it sticks in my craw. as much as any other senators in the chamber. it is merely going to come out of the general law enforcement effort of batf. period.
i would like the senator to tell me what he is going to add by virtue of his amendment to the following language of the bill: provided. that funds appropriated herein shall be available for administrative expenses in connection with consolidating or centralizing within the department of the treasury the records of receipt and disposition of firearms maintained by federal firearms licensees or for issuing or carrying out any provisions of the proposed rules of the department of the treasury. bureau of alcuhol. tobacco and firearms. on firearms regulations. as published in the federal register. volume 43. number 55. of march 21. 1978. what does the senators amendment add to the provisions of this bill relative to those regulations  being implemented.
. for the reasons cited above. i urge the adoption of the language proposed by the senator from washington that permits federal funding of abortions where medically necessary. the decision whether or  the abortion procedure is medically necessary to the health of the woman is one that should be left to the doctor and his patient. we in the congress are  physicians equipped to make those kinds of decisions and we should  put ourselves in the position of controlling those decisions. of the greatest importance has to be the clear understanding of what it is our position represents. it is  a furtherance of any religionany. it is to assure that all can practice their beliefs. their religious beliefs. in total freedom and with interference from their government. . there are those who would like to stand on the senate floor and do away with the medicaid program or that policy which assures federal funding for that which is medically necessary. that you have the power to do. but to selectively target that policy so as to circumvent the law of the land and. more importantly. to circumvent one of the great principles upon which this nation is based.  that is an improper use of the power granted to us under the constitution. clearly. the proper thing to do would be to take the language of the supreme court and use it as the guideline for what we federally fund. that has  been done. as i said what you are doing here is to make a compromise. but what cxxv- 1223---part 15 bothers me is it is  a legislative compromise. you are compromising the law of the land. you are compromising the constitution of the united states. you are cheapening the independence of the judiciary. we can afford that kind of compromise. it sounds great for those who are benefited by that compromise. but i think it important to understand that sooner or later each one of us is going to be in the position of wanting independence of thought and remedy from the judiciary. but once this precedent has been established. then all of us are subject to de facto control of the judiciary by the legislative branch of government. that would be a disgrace and the end of all freedom
. i must stress that a piecemeal approach of building upon the existing system is  the way to guarantee quality and affordable health care to every american in this country. what is needed is embodied in the kennedy health care for all americans act: comprehensive benefits. universal coverage. the strongest possible quality and cost controls. system reforms to encourage preventive medicine and prepaid group practice. in addition. it gives a meaningful role to the private sector insurers. if we build on the best in both the private sector and the government. we will attain that goal. the health care for all americans act of 1979 makes sense. to me. this is what a national health insurance plan should include. what the congress should pass. and most importantly. what the people of this country deserve. again. i am pleased to lend my support to this legislation and will push actively for its adoption during this congress.*
i indicated on october 22 when we considered the district of columbia appropriations bill that that was the last time the fight was going to be fought on the grounds of those who advocate federal funds for abortions. that is going to be the case. because after we dispose of this matter. and i hope we defeat it. there are two amendments which i will be ready to offer. and i will offer them in time to get the matter going the other way. one of them will say: e of the funds provided for in this act shall be used to perform abortions after the second trimester of pregnancy. except where the life of the mother would be endangered. or where. as determined by the attending physician. health damage to the mother would result. if the pregnancy were carried to term. in other words. all i am asking us to do is conform policy to what is the law of this country. that is the law. the second amendment would say: e of the funds provided for in this act shall be used to perform abortions except where: the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest. when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service. or except in those instances where severe and longlasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians. or except where the fetus is at risk for genetic disorders. chromosomal abmalities. or has been exposed to a kn teratogenic agent. or except where the mother has sickle cell disease. . in this amendment. we would add the element which has been totally disregarded by everybody in the debate. that is. the health of the child. i am  here arguing against this amendment offered by the senator from th carolina because it in any way impairs the right of those serving the armed forces of the united states. i think that is important. but there is one common deinator which is more important. that is that we are all citizens of the united states. and it is to all americans that the law is directed. for whom policies are devised. it was only a matter of time before we got the hyde amendment before us in its purest form. indeed. what i would say here is that we should go to an even purer form and. instead of having those who advocate the tenets of a particular religious faith run around robin hoods barn. we should have on the floor of the u.s. senate the direct issue of whether or  abortion is legal. period. let us make that decision. instead of coming at it in a backhanded way. the policy of the united states has already been made amply clear by the senate. and the house. and presidents to the extent that any serious medical procedure is going to be funded by this government. is there anybody. on the other side of the "abortion issue." who would deny that an abortion is a serious medical procedure. why. then. do we have the issue before us. we have it before us because those who advocate the tenets of a particular religious faith k that. were the issue up or a vote on the question of the legality of abortions. they probably could  carry the day. i hope that we shall start to understand what it is that we are doing here in the constitutional sense. that is our jobagain. i repeat the words i said a few weeks ago to take up the slack for what somebody can do from the pulpit on sunday. that is  our job. our job is to see to it. both by our actions on the floor and the position that we enjoy as leaders of this nation. that we give support to what is the law of the land. the law of the land is that the mothers right to abortion is a constitutionally guaranteed right. within the parameters of the roe against wade decision. only after the fetus has reached viability can the government proscribe abortion. slowly but surely. this position has been nibbled to death. if you will.  we are confronted with the penultimate decision here. on the floor of the u.s. senate.
. barring any comment from anybody on my side of the aisle and going ahead and moving to a vote. again i repeat. i hope that we will reject this amendment. it is $500 million without any conditions. without any guarantees. it is naked. it is out there for all to see. it is $500 million to the chrysler corp. after all the promises that the taxpayers money is to be safeguarded by the administration. by the secretary of the treasury. by the senate committee. by the house committee.  we come down to the barebones issue here which is whether or  we are going to give them. whatever they need. safeguard or safeguard. i think this is probably the most important amendment to this bill. because it will probably signal the eventual outcome of the bill. in the sense that anybody who votes for it will. in essence. have voted for the bill. there is hing that will come before us that will be less restrictive than this particular amendment. i am sorry it has  been withdrawn. it is my understanding that the chrysler corp. or the uaw or whatever. finds it unacceptable. well. come on . let us stand up and use our good judgment on this matter.  what other people are trying to tell us about what is acceptable. if they had listened to advice. they would  have been in the predicament where they have to come to us for our help. we do  ask medical advice from a dying man. we are the ones who have to prescribe here. we are the ones who have to go ahead and use what is sound. healthy judgment. are we going to make an unrestricted loan to a group that is before us in a near state of bankruptcy. come on. it is  your money. it is  my money. it belongs to the taxpayers of this country. we have a fiduciary obligation. it is just as important to my friends on the appropriations committee. they ought to k what this takes away from the appropriations process. if we wrap it up in this bill. there will be appropriations process. it wraps it up in the bill so that the appropriations committee is totally excluded from the process. i hope we reject it. i am ready to vote.
. i ask unanimous consent that prior to acting on the amendment of the senator from connecticut. as amended by the amendment of the senator from nebraska. already agreed to. that the following langauge be inserted at line 11. after the word "service": " are payments prohibited for drugs or devices to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum. or for medical procedures necessary for the termination of an ectopic pregnancy."
. again i will restate a few of the matters that were covered in my brief opening remarks. which were touched upon by the distinguished senator from idaho when he referred to the quality of life in cuba precastro. the fact is that cuba. in 1958. was based on a society where only a small miity of the people. plus those american tourists that came in. could enjoy education and health care and housing. and all those things which are the basic rights of all people throughout the world. i do  yearn for the good old days of fulgencio batista in cuba. indead. wha batista did in cuba is exactly wh is repeated time and time again thrighout the caribbean. central america. and south america. and which gives ground for communism to come in to exploit it and to grow. does the senator from idaho. for example. recognize the fact that under batista education was the privilege of the elite and . because of an aggressive education initiative by the government. by the latest figures of the united nations. literacy in cuba is 96 percent. that is all the people.  some american tourists.  some mafioso in their gambling casi.  a few businessmen.  those who exploited all the people of cuba.  what we are talking about  is a nation that has access to education. a nation that has accessto health care. and a nation that has access to housing. imperfect. certainly. by our standards. hing to be desired by any american. but to say this country is wbrse off in 1982 than it was in 1958 fails to recognize the exact problem that we are confronted with in this part of the world. which is that cuba has used herself as a showcase as to what can be achieved by a system of government somewhat different than the paternalism offered by the united states in the past or by the form of dictatorship offered by batista. what i am suggesting to the senator is that i do  want my gereration to live with the policy that he wants to continue to extend which permits the soviet union to grow in central america and the caribbean and south america. and it will continue to grow until the basic necessities of life are available to all the people of those nations.
. i wish to thank my distinguished colleague for his remarks. i am indeed proud to receive this award from asha. i am especially pleased at the consistent. firm. and effective support asha has demonstrated for individuals with communicative disorders. this last year they have been successful in working with congress to maintain the federalstate program for the education of handicapped children (public law 94142) and with the administration in having the occupational safety and health administration issue a reasonable regulation to protect the hearing of millions of workers in industry. i am sure that all who wish to improve the lives of handicapped individualsparticularly those who can communicatewill find the members. leaders. and staff of asha. headed by frank t. spahr. ph. d.. executive director. true and effective allies.e
. the secretary of health and human services. the secretary of education. and the congress of the united states. the council. its distinguished chairman. howard a. rusk. m.d. and executive director. carol berman. have done an outstanding job which reflects the substantial effort and time that the council has invested in 1981. this report contains an insightful critique on the activities of the rehabilitation services administration and the national institute of handicapped research. and a statement on the status of research concerning handicapped persons in the united states. among the many topics covered by the national council on the handicapped during 1981. a dominant subject was the current and potential impact of executive and legislative proposals relating to the future structure of programs concerning handicapped people. from their thorough and intensive study. the council has developed astute recommendations which i especially want to call to my colleagues attention. i ask that this executive summary and table of contents be printed in the record.
. while there is much more that is good to be said about this bill. we must recognize that it is cureall for dwindling voter participation. political apathy is a disease which ks racial barriers. but because miities have borne the brunt of voting rights abuses. they are understandably more inclined to feel that their vote is inconsequential. that conviction can be erased but it will require vigilant and vigorous enforcement of this act from local election officials right up to the attorrey general. all of us must take seriouslyand  for grantedour right and responsibility to vote. the key to good government lies therein. as the washington post pointed out in an editorial earlier this year. "the voting rights act was  intended to be a substitute for the political process. but rather to enable it to work." with that in mind. i commend this bill to my colleagues and urge its speedy passage.
. i ask unanimous consent that the subcommittee on health. of the committee on finance. be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on thursday. september 16. at 9:30 a.m.. to hold a hearing to consider hospital reimbursement systems used by private thirdparty payers.
. the designation of national diabetes month will help call the effects of the disease to the attention of the american people and will provide an opportunity for greater public and patient awareness and education of the effects of diabetes. i urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this resolution. i ask unanimous consent that the names of the following senators be added as cosponsors of senate joint resolution 257. to designate ember 1982 as national diabetes month.
. americas disabled citizens are at long last beginning to be recognized as full. equal. productive. and participating members of society. this is happening thanks to several factors. among which is the constant commitment of the federal government to laws insuring rights and services of disabled people. critical to the success of disabled people. however. is the dedicated competence of rehabilitation professionals and i proudly call my colleagues attention to one such professional from my state of connecticut: mr. edmund s. mclaughlin. mr. mclaughlin. on wednesday. october 27. will be hoed on his 25th anniversary as executive director of the faster seal rehabilitation center of eastern fairfield county. inc. in his quarter of a century as center executive. mr. mclaughlin has developed the original crippled childrens workshop of bridgeport into one of our nations finest comprehensive outpatient medical rehabilitation facilities. throughout this perpd. he has never wavered in his insistence of excellence and the results achieved for bridgeport area people have been outstanding. mr. mclatighlins vitality. however. has  been confined 1ithin his center. he has reached out to other health providers within his community to effect maximum coordination of. and efficiency in. the delivery of services to disabled people. he has galvanized his fellow rehabilitation professionals on both state and national levels into meaningful voices for disabled people. additionally. he has participated in the development of accountability standards for servioe pro viders to insure that the highest standards are both recognized and met. i commend mr. mclaughlin on his record of achievement and extend best wishes to him for much continued success in meeting the needs of the disabled.
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1984 public witness hearings on thursday. april 28. friday. april 29. monday. may 2. and conclude on tuesday. may 3. these hearings will be preceded by a hearing on wednesday. april 27 when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is tuesday. march 15. all requests must be in writing and should be addressed to me in care of the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd186. washington. d.c. those persons whose requests are received by march 15 will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be friday. may 6. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and 3 copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
. the legislation which i am introducing today authorizes the secretary of health and human services to accept accreditation by the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities (carp) in determining the medicare eligibility of outpatient rehabilitation facilities. the bill simply gives the secretary the discretion to recognize carp accreditation in lieu of certification by a state medicare agency. under present law. all rehabilitation agencies and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities which provide medicare services must be certified by state medicare agencies. each year. the state agency must survey each facility and certify that it meets the standards required to be a medicare provider. this process insures that beneficiaries under the program are receiving the quality services to which they are entitled. many of the same facilities which must undergo annual surveys by their state agencies also seek accreditation by carp. carp is a private. profit organization established by and for the field of rehabilitation to adopt and supply standards in facilities throughout the united states. rehabilitation facilities seek carf accreditation because it is a symbol of excellence among health care professionals and the public. in order to receive carps approval. strict adherence to quality service is required. carp surveys are conducted by recognized experts who are kledgeable in the delivery of services to individuals with disabilities. surveyors are selected based on their familiarity with the particular type of programs operated by the facility requesting accreditation. site survey teams spend approximately 11/2 days in the facility applying the standards and making a determination of the specific strengths and weaknesses of the facility and program with respect to the standards. a detailed survey report is then prepared. the report goes to the carp board of trustees which makes the final accreditation decision. the commissions member organizations have grown over the years to include a number of national organizations involved in rehabilitation. these members. which effectively provide a broad base of representation of the various segments and points of view in rehabilitation. include: the american hospital association. goodwill industries of america. inc.. the national easter seal society. the national rehabilitation association. and the united cerebral palsy associations. inc. the board of trustees of the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities is composed of representatives of these members. plus atlarge trustees appointed by the board. a few years ago. some of the sponsoring members of carp asked the secretary of health and human services to create "deemed status" for carpaccredited facilities. the officials at the health care financing administration (hcfa) who undertook the long and tedious process of evaluating and comparing them with medicare regulations for outpatient providers were impressed with the commissions standards. the director of health standards and quality bureau indicated that carfs program is "an effective standardization instrument and is symbolic of the excellence of your total organization. efforts directed toward improving the quality of rehabilitation services." in the final analysis. however. hcfa officials indicated that they were precluded by statute from granting "deemed status" to carp. hcfa based its decision on an opinion by the office of general counsel which stated that the "failure to provide the authority" was apparently "an oversight on the dart of congress. rather than a conscious choice." my bill would give the secretary the discretion to accept carf accreditation if it is determined that carfs standards meet the criteria. in the medicare regulations. it would  mandate the secretary to do so. furthermore. if "deemed status" is established for carfaccredited facilities. those facilities which are  carf accredited could continue to provide medicare services as long as they are certified by the state medicare agency. the measure. if approved. would simply eliminate the need for outpatient rehabilitation facilities to undergo two essentially duplicative surveys. this would  only save the facilities administrative expenses incurred from site surveys. but would also reduce unnecessary government expenditures. my bill has been endorsed by the national easter seal society. the easter seal society of connecticut. inc.. and the seven easter seal rehabilitation centers in the state of connecticut.e by mr. percy (by request):
. the amendment of the distinguished senator from utah is acceptable to the majority. i k of the senators interest in this matter of home health care and training personnel adequate to meet the new requirements of the law. and i am delighted to join him in this endeavor.
. i intend to be relieving the distinguished senator from oregon at his chair in this matter. when i take over that chair. i intend to raise the section on laborhhs. with all the education amendments. science amendments. health amendments. and everything else. if one is here. i am going to go ahead and pass them as controversial amendments. so anybody that has any problem with that section--it is the biggest section with the exception of defense on the billhe better get on the floor. because in 1 hours time i intend to be done with my section of this bill.
. i want to call my colleagues attention to a particularly significant item within the billamendment  144 to h.r. 3069under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on labor. health. and human services. and education and related agencies. i want to emphasize the need for a research and training center focusing on pediatric rehabilitation needs and reiterate the directive in the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report that this center be located at the university of connecticut. furthermore. the bill addresses the unique rehabilitation needs of the pacific basin and establishes a research and training center in this area. the conferees directed that this center be located at the university of hawaii. the need for the establishment of these two centers is reflected  only by this supplemental appropriations bill. but is also clearly addressed in the provisions of s. 1340. the rehabilitation amendments of 1983. s. 1340. passed by the senate on july 26. specifically authorizes a pediatric and a pacific basin research and training center. the committee report for s. 1340 likewise directs that the pediatric rehabilitation center be located at the university of connecticut and that the pacific basin center be located at the university of hawaii. by affirming the need for tnese two centers in two separate bills. and specifying their location in both reports. we have clearly indicated our intent regarding the establishment of pediatric and pacific basin research and training centers. following enactment of this supplemental. the administration should act expeditiously to establish these two vitally needed research and training centers at the two locations directed by congress.
. currently in 42 u.s.c. 165. the basic enabling legislation for saint elizabeths hospital. there is a provision concerning the duties and responsibilities of the superintendent of the hospital which mandates that lie shall reside on the piemises". this is an archaic provision in law that dates back to the 19th century and was appropriate for an era when modern communications systems. available today. were existent or scarce. the superintendent and other physiclans and - psychiatrists critical to the operation of the hospital are accessible and on call through telephones and "beeper" contact 24 hours a day. also. the hospital follows an administrative rotation procedure where the superintendent and chief hospital administrators share. on a rotation basis. weekend and holiday assignment coverage. the continued requirement that the superintendent must reside on the premises is longer justified. with the arrival of new superintendent. this archaic provision needs to be rectified. therefore. at the request of the department. this amendment is offered which states. again. repeating the amendment asit was read: during fiscal year 1984 and thereafter the superintendent of saint elizabeths hospital may reside off the premises of the hospital. withstanding section 4839 of the revised statutes (42 u.s.c. 165).
. i do  believe in standing here and making speeches for appearances sake. so i will tell you exactly what my feelings are with respect to the amendment of the distinguished senators from georgia and arkansas. i understand fully the problem to which you are directing your energies and your cuts. i would like to examine it. you have my word that i will. but i think that it has to be done in .more judicious way because i do  believe that you really mean to achieve that which will be achieved under terms of this amendment. this amendment will strike directly at the national institutes of health. the national cancer institute. the heart and lung institutes. the national institute on arthritis. diabetes. and digestive ind kidney diseases. alcohol and mental iaealth programs. and the centers for disease control. much of their work is being done by consultants. i can believe that is what you want to accomplish with this amendment. i have problem with a welldirected amendment relative to consultants. i do  like them any better than you do. so. in a sense of giving the chairman a message. you have done that. i hope the amendment will be withdrawn on my assurance that i will work with you in achieving an amendment which we will put on an appropriations bill in this regard. in the absence of thatand i hope that is the way we can dispose of the amendmentyes. i can take it to conference. since i have already expressed my opinion on the amendment. you can take it from there. i really do  have much further to say about this subject. i compliment both sponsors of the amendment. again. i repeat. you make a valid point. and as long as we can rifleshot it instead of having a shotgun approach. i have problem dealing with this problem in a positive way in the next appropriations bill.
. i say to my distinguished friend from massachusetts. one feels more strongly than this senator on this matter. i might add that it was the subject of some rather intense questioning when the secretary of the health and human services appeared before the appropriations subcommittee. it was the subject of some rather intense followup letters requesting the reappearance of the secretary before the subcommittee. it was at that time. as the senaitor well ks. that the administration indicated that it had a plan on this matter. the administration indicated that it was expecting to agree upon a health plan for the unemployed. it was only on that assurance that the subcommittee withheld any action. of course. the plan that came foth from mr. stockman a little later onthat is. that the unemployed should go ahead and pay their own health premiumswas  exactly what was envisioned by this senator or. i am sure. by the senator from massachusetts. so. insofar as the problem is concerned and the attention that should be devoted to it. those thoughts expressed by the senator from massachusetts have the complete concurrence of the senator from connecticut. i would hope that the matter would  find its way onto this bill only in the sense that i gather there still is work to be done on it. senator dole *and others with authorizing responsibility are obviously going to have to be ipart of the scenario of a solution. and. again. i can only implore my good friend  to jeopardize the passage of this bill. the first in 5 years. but. krather to try to work it out in the reg. ular process. i assure the senator he is igoing to have my full support on any -matter that comes to this floor along these lines.
the senator has the assurance of this senator. in whatever role he plays. that i would support him in getting that kind of an upordown vote. the senator is also going to have my support  just to have an upordown vote. but against any proposal that calls for the unemployed to pay their own health premiumns. that is unacceptable. it is to me. it is to the senator from massachusetts. so the senator can also rest assured that on the substance of the matter he is going to have the support of this senator.
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1985 public witness hearings on thursday. april 12. tuesday. april 24. wednesday. april 25. thursday. april 26. and conclude on tuesday. may 1. these hearings will be preceded by a hearing on wednesday. april 11 when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is wednesday. march 7. all requests must be in writing and should be addressed to me in care of the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd131. washington. d.c. 20510. those persons whose requests are received by march 7 will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be friday. may 4. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and three copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
. blacks fought side by side with whites to safeguard these truths: that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. that among these life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. the resolution i am introducing today recognizes their contributions and encourages government at all levels. and private organizations too. to appropriately remember these individuals. more than 200 years have passed. but their unselfishness and heroism stand as an important monument to the american ideal of freedom. i urge my colleagues to join me in giving tribute to these unsung americans.6 by mr. lautenbero (for himself. mr. dole. and mr. pell): s.j. res. 222. joint resolution de.signating the month of june 1984 as "student awareness of drunk driving month." to the committee on the judiciary.
. in the present regulatory climate where each major payer of health services. including the federal and state governments. is aggressively pursuing cost control. it is essential that the distribution of health services  become a function of formula regulation. the explosion in total revenues spent for health care has  resulted in equal availability. medically underserved areas continue
. i should like to address myself further if i may. to matters contained in the amendment before us. specifically to explain that aspect of the amendment which relates to the increased funding. which. in turn. could translate into additional dollars for both education and health. my emphasis being on the health side of it. it is true that i was one of the original sponsors of the chafeewelcker amendment. in that amendment. we sought.  1. to redirect priorities in the sense of reducing defense spending and upping the funding for health and education in the same dollars. or  in the same amountso that. indeed. what would be effected would be a reduction in the deficit. we would accomplish both a reduction in defense spending. a less than equivalent amount of money then going back into health and education. with the total dollars being less and. therefore. a reduction in the deficit. the amendment also called for one cap in order that defense would  be isolatsd in the course of the appropriations committees determination. that is what we lost by one vote. we went back to the drawing boards and talked to the leadership on this side. that. in essence. resulted in what we have before us. with two able changes. first. we are back to a twocap situation. and. second. defense dollars were  reduced. am i disappointed in the fact that we still have two caps. the answer is yes. hing was accomplished on that score. however. on the matter of defense dollars. as a practical matter. i would expect that the conference procedure and the position of the house will have some impact on the senate numbers. in other words. during the course of the entire legislative process. i would suspect that the reduction in defense dollars will be even greater than that proposed in the chafeewelcker amendment. we are. in effect. doing in two steps what that amendment did in one. with the exception of the cap situation.  the question has been raised on the matter of the education and health moneys. how did we ever guarantee that the moneys sought by senator bradley and senator stafford and senator weicker. those moneys that relate to education and health. will come forth in the numbers that had been discussed and agreed upon. i shall let senator stafford speak for himself. but i can address myself to the health numbers. i can also address myself to the general situation as it relates to the appropriations committee. the chairman . the chairman of the education subcommittee . and myself as chairman of the laborhhs committee. neither senator hatfield. as chairman of the full committee.  i as chairman of the laborhhs committee can stand here on the floor and deliver the votes of the members of our committee and subcommittee respectively. we can do that. so that. obviously. as a legal technical matter. there is still a question mark there. however. the distinguished chairman of the full committee has given me his word that he will do everythingas indeed he already had before this compromise was every arrived atto see that the figures for health funding would be at the level which i had set forth visavis the preparation of the chafeeweicker amendment and as had been envisaged in the amendment of the distinguished senator from new jersey. hing has changed. i still have the word of the chairman of the appropriations committee. i give my word to my colleagues that i expect to get those numbers out of my subcommittee. . there is fakery here. i do  want to get my good friend.from new mexico mad because i do  want by implication to indicate there was any fakery in the original figures. but i will say this. that during the negotiating process the administration indicatedif i may have the attention of the distinguished senator from new jerseythat the moneys would be supplied by some changes that could be found later on down the line. and that was  satisfactory to either me or to the senator froni the appropriations committee because that we have control over. and i mean e. we are  even a vote in that process. we rejected that approach. so we specifically received a commitment for $2 billion additional to go into the ap. propriations process. of which we are a part and where we can vote as individuals. i want the record to be clear that my position on the $650 million for biomedical research. as stated in the subcommittee hearings. as envisaged in the preparation of chafeeweicker. ac presented to the chairman and the republican leadership in the drafting of the baker compromise. has  changed one iota. will  change one iota in the weeks ahead as the appropriations committee does its work. the senator from. new jersey and my colleagues within this chamber on both sides of the aisle have my word as a senator. as chairman of the subcommittee of laborhhs. that those figures will be attained and will be a part of the additional moneys produced out of either synfuels or a transfer of funds. that figure of $650 million holds. and it is  subject to the whims of the executive branch but. admittedly. it is subject to the votes of my subcommittee and the full committee. and i might add those votes are going to come as much from the senators side as they are from this side. if the senator wants any other statement which i can deliver on. never mind speculative. if the senator wants any other statement to be male in terms of commitment. he hes every right to ask it and he will get it on the floor of the senate from me..
. this amendment eliminates $31.3 million from the national endowment for democracy. that we might bett.er understand exactly what the national endowment for democracy consists of. it consists of the republican national committee. the democratic national committee. the aflcio. and the chamber of commerce. that is big business. big labor. and big politics. this is a $31.3 million slush fund in order that these institutions. these four institutions. might best convey the meanings of our political beliefs to the world. i would suggest to my colleagues. and i do  intend to make a long speech. that there are many ways that we can do that without having to channel money through these particular institutions. my amendment calls for the elimination of the moneys for the endowment entirtly. it is my understanding that the senator from new hampshire has an amendment in the nature of a seconddegree amendment to call for the elimination of the moneys that go to the republican and democratic national committees. it is also my understanding that hard on the heels of this will come an amendment from the distinguish .d senator from south carollna wihich will take these moneys and transfer them into fellowships. humphrey fellowships and fulbright scholarships. that is as good a point. as any to start off with. if you want to k how democracy can communicate best. believe me. it connuniicates well through the humphrey fellowships and the fulbright scholarships. it is a matter of bringing students from all over the world to our shores and ours going abroad. can you think of a better way for this nation -to communicate than through our young people. through the idealism that they represent. communicating that. abroad. and bringing persons to our shores that they might see the greatest educational system in the world at work in a democracy. we do  need the aflcio or the republican national committee or the chamber of commerce or the democrat ic national commit t ee to do that. we do  needi any middleman. let our young people speak for what we believe in and let us show what we have to the young people of the world. as most of you k. i sit as chairman of laborhhs in the appropriations subcommittee that has charge of all financing of education. health. and science. i was talking to my good friend. dr. krause. chairman of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. malaria kills about 5 million people around the world. it is  a great problem in this country but it is in the world. we are wilhin a very short space of overcoming the disease of malaria. we are on the verge of developing an effect.ive malaria vaccine. can you imagine what. dr. krause could do with $31 million to conquer nialaria. can you think of anything better that would speak for democracy and what we are capable of doing if we could eradicate inalaria. education. science. i could go down the whole checklist. i will  take the time of my colleagues to do it. to say that yes. we can certainly present a face to the world that will have people believing in our system. but we do  need t lie middlemen of tie republican national committee or the chamber of commerce or the aflcio or the democratic national committee. i understand. for example. if you want to k how ridiculous these little projects are. the chamber of commerce. in using their funds last year. used ned funds for travel to international conferences in stockholm. bonn. and brussels. can anybody tell me why bonn. stockholm. and brussels need any lessons in democracy.
. i would like to bring my colleagues attention to a report just completed by my staff on the subcommittee on the handicapped. this report is the result of visits across the country to federally funded institutions for mentally retarded persons. it is a report which documents abuse and neglect. lack of prdgramming. and inappropriate placement in these institutions as national problems. these are institutions which receive $2.3 billion federal dollars per year. i would also like to submit for the record the results of recent surveys of institutions by the u.s. department of health and human services. these surveys confirm the existence of nationwide problems in institutions for mentally retarded people. in a joint hearing this morning before the subcommittee on the handicapped and the appropriations subcommittee on labor/hhs/education and related services. secretary heckler confirmed the existence of these problems in our nations institutions. i intend to continue investigations of these institutions by the subcommittee on the handicapped. i will also pursue legislative proposals to address these problems. i urge my colleagues to join me in addressing these problems and securing appropriate treatment and safe living conditions for our nations mentally retarded citizens.
. this amendment adds $2 million to the health care financing administration [hcfa] appropriation to provide for increased monitoring of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded eicmprs]. in order to improve the quality of care provided to the residents of these institutions. this $2 million would enable hcfa to hire 45 additional developmental disability and health care personnel who would be responsible for surveying icfmrs on an annual basis to ensure that federal certification standards are being met. earlier this year. members ofmy staff visited seven icmfrs nationwide. and found substandard conditions. including overuse of medication and physical restraints. lack of active treatment. physical surroundings that were barren at best and life threatening at worst. residents living in institutions who appropriately belong in the community. and. at every institution. superintendents reported abuse of patients. in july. secretary heckler testified before my joint handicapped and laborhhseducation subcommittees hearing that recent hhs visits to 17 icfmrs found everyone operating under substandard conaitions. at the conclusion of the hearing. i requested that secretary heckler determine how much in the way of financial resources and personnel would be necessary to survey these institutions in order to obtain compliance with certification standards. hhs  estimates $2 million is necessary to accomplish these surveys. with these additional funds. hcfa will be able to survey all institutions with 300 or more residents. 40 percent of institutions with 16 to 299 residents. and 20 percent of icfmrs with 15 or fewer individuals. our nations institutionalized mentally retarded deserve the highest quality of care that we can provide. and this amendment would be a first step toward ensuring that they receive that level of care. i urge adoption of this amendment.
. my amendment does  increase the community health center appropriation. but rather allows funds  used to pay the salaries of federal assignees under the nhsc to be used instead to make supplemental grants to health centers to help them meet the cost of hiring the nhsc obligees. without such language. the complete burden of payment rests with the health centers. who too often in the past have had to cut back on health and preventive services in order to meet nhsc conversion costs.
. i certainly share the deep concern of the senator from california that we remain committed to the goal of finding the means to treat and ultimately prevent aids. and i am pleased to reassure the senator that his understanding is correct. i have been advised by the department of health and human services that out of the nih appropriation in the bill nih would use at least $15.431 million more for the aids research than the $45.663 million originally planned for that purpose in the administrations fiscal year 1985 budget. thus. under the committee bill there is a total of at least $61.094 million in the nih appropriation for aids.
. i share the senators concern for  only his state. but for citizens in other areas of the country. to what extent is the centers for disease control [cdc] actively involved in a program to remedy this public health problem.
i appreciate the senators kind words and i am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the cirids. this is a congressionally mandated program that the committee feels has been highly successful and should continue to receive strong support. in answer to the senators inquiry. the committee believes that its bill does provide the latitude for the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to create new cirids. the committee recognizes that the frequency and characteristics of immuogic diseases vary among different regions of the country and among different ethnic groups. the committee also believes dissemination of information in the area served by a cirid is a vital function of these centers. the committee would therefore be pleased if the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases found that it would be appropriate to establish new cirids. with consideration s1i1704 given to geographic distribution of the centers.
. i believe it is necessary to clarify the legislative history with respect to the appropriations bill we are considering today. on june 29. 1984. the senate committee on appropriations reported an original bill. s. 2836 senate report 98544. making appropriations for the departments of labor. health and human services. education. and related agencies. at the time of reporting that legislation. the committee also authorized us to offer committee amendments to any housepassed bill which we might subsequent ly recve. thus. h.r. 6028 has been printed to reflect the action of tile appropriations committee on s. 2836. the amendments of the committee which have been considered nerely riflet our (arlier commit tee considerat ion. because the two bills are identical in substance. the report of the commit tee on s. 2836 also governs the intent of the appropriations committee with respect to the amendments offered by the committee to ii.r. 60218. we. therefore. expect that the departments and agencies funded by this legislation will follow the guidance of the committee as provided in seinatie report 98544.
. the senator from california and i. in a colloquy last friday. stated our concerns for adequate funding for aids research. i remain committed to the goal of finding the means to treat and ultimately prevent this devastating disease. i am. therefore. prepared to accept this amendment which adds $11.2 million to the centers for disease control. $2.606.000 to the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases. and $822.000 for the alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health admiristration. these funds are to be used to intensify the efforts being made in aids research and surveiliance.
. i want to point out to my colleagues what will be involved if indeed we go to the continuing resolution rather than to pass this bill as we  have it before us. as to the department of labor. the job corps. there is a $34 million difference between this bill and the house continuing resolution. and without these funds. program quality would suffer by increasing the size of the classes. and caselopds of counselors and supervisors. 2.400 enrollees would be cut. community service employment for older americaos. $17 million would he denied as between this bill and the house continuing resolution. the addition of 3.400 jobs for the lowincome ellerly would be denied. health and human services. miternal and child health. the house continuing resolution is $79 million low the bill on the floor here ii t le senate. services for crippled childrt n. the provision of newborn gevntic screening. sudden infant death s rvices. lead poisoning prevention scivices. and prenatal medical services are. among others. provided through allocations to the states. and those allocations would be reduced by $79 million. these are the people who would suffer by virtue of accepting the house continuing resolution compared to the senate bill. community health services. $8.650.000 below the senate bill. kssential prevent ioiented primary care services for the medically underserved populations provided for more than 4.700.000 people in 1974. the senate mark would permit service to be provided to aher 350.000. that would be denied if we go to the continuing resolution. health resources and services administration. we could train 1.100 new doctors in family medicine. including geriatrics. we could support 1.700 more r(eidents in general internal medicine and pediatrics than were funded in 1984. the senate bill calls for the establishment of 24 new geriatric academic administrative units in universities. specifically to train doctors in nil aspects ol geriatric medicine. that is  includee in the house continuing resolution. we could provide for 9 new area health education center projicts which. added to the 10 continuntion projects. would cover 19 states with a geographic area of 420 counties and a total population of 41 million people in primarily rural areas who lack adequate health services. that is  in the house continuing resolution. it is in the senate bill. four thousand two hundred more disadvantaged students would be able to receive financial assistance to become health professionals. 3.000 more students would be able to receive advanced nurse training. 1.000 more students would be able to enroll in the professional nurse traineeship program under the senate bill. 160 more people would receive traineeships in order to assist them to become nurse anesthetists. the senate bill provides $5 million to establish the center for nursing research. funds were provided in 1984 to support programs on educational and clinical nursing restarch. training. and information disseminat ion. head start: the senate bill is $79.309.000 more than the house continuing resolution. these funds would permit enrolling 32.000 more children in head start. denial of this money would require a cut of 1.000 children below the level currently served. nutrition for the elderly. $15.301.000 less than the house continuing re:.olution. the average number of meals per day served to needy elderly persons could be increased by 32.000. without these funds. the. current level of 806.000 average daily meals could  be sustained due to the impact of inflation. lowincome energy assistance with winter coming on. $65 million more than the house continuing resolution. these funds repri sent a 3percent increase over last years level. in order to offset rising energy costs. without thesc funds. fewer lowincome people will be provided assistance in meeting fuel bills this winter these additional funds would serve an estimated 300.000 households. refugeetargeted assist ance. $27.500.000. targeted assist ance funds would be limited to $50 million. a onethird reduction from fiscal year 1984. targeted assistance funds serve localit ies highly impacted by heavy concentrat ions of refugees. community services block grant. $20.272.000 more than the house continuing resolution. it is estimated an additional 1.1 million impoverished people would be served with the higher amount in the senate bill. 40 new community action agencies would be open to provide antipoverty programs in unserved areas. compensatory education for the disadvantaged: $16.6 million more in the senate bill than the house cont inuing resolution. and the lower house amount results in approximately 220000 fewer migrant children. and 12.000 fewer handicapped children in state institutions being served. libraries: $63 million. the house bill provides increase in public library service. and completely eliminates federal matching funds for library construction reatijn. the senate bill includes mathscience funds. $200 million. includes desegregation assistance. $75 million. includes the special olympics as presented by the distinguished senator from utah. these are all in the senate bill. i think maybe this is the place to draw the line on the issue that has brought us to this impasse. once again. we have a prayerinschool amendment. if everybody wants to go ahead and pray that things are going to work out all right for the poo-. for the homeless. for the diseased. and for the retarded. go ahead and do so. i am sure it has its effect but i suggest that a few dollars are necessary to accomplish the ends of giving them a better life. hope for the future. and. indeed. in many cases. life itself. . that is what this bill is about. it is the united states of america speaking from its heart to those who need our special care. to the smallest. and to the least powerful of our citizensthe least powerful in the sense of their physical condition. mental condition. ecoics. or whatever. prayer is a powerful thing. and we all believe in it. let each one do his own thing. but that is  going to help these people. what is needed is dollars. what is needed is programs. and what is needed is people committed to their neighbor. in the some 25 days of hearings that took place. i wish all of you could have shared those moments with the committee and with those persons afflicted with certain diseases king that their only hope for life for either themselvesbecause many of them spoke for themselvesor for their children. or loved oneslay with the united states of america with its national institutes of health. and with the various programs going on in the universities of this nation. jod. how hard it is to fight for a few pennies for life in this nation compared to the billions we spend on destruction. but  we come down to the ultimate pray your way out of it. this is one of the finest work products to come out of this body in this session in terms of the hope that it delivers to so many. whether tihe hope is in terms of an education. or whether the hope is the financial help necessary to achieve that education. i mention in here the fact that this bill calls for the establishment of 24 new geriatric academic administrative units in the universities. do you realize at the present time in this nation we only have two such units in our universities that arc dedicated to geriatrics. do you understand the rapid multiplication that is going on right  as to our elderly ppulation. and that we are totally unprepared for it. only 2 out of the some 123 university medical complexes arc devoted to the specialty of geriatrics. i hope. again. staff will provide me with the exact figures as to what is happening to the elderly population in the united states by the year 2000. and the year 2010. the figures are staggering. we can all sit there and admire our parents. and those growing old around us. but i suggest to you again we had better do something instead of either packing them off to nursing homes or telling them to get down on their knees and say a prayer. it seems to me we can do something. that is what this bill provides for. i think many of us felt there was something special to the bill in the sense it was  just appropriating money the old way. but again foreseeing the complexities of the future. and preparing in terms of the elderly of this nation.
. if the senate increase of $80.400.000 for head start is ultimately enacted in law. as i hope it will be. there will be plenty of room to accommodate utilizing $1.600.000 for the bia projects. these projects would naturally have to compete with other aplications for head start expansion funding. but given the set of circumstances described by the senator from mississippi. i would expect the department of health and human services to give them every possible opportunity for full and fair consideration.
. i do  have any direct jurisdiction within my subcommittee. that belongs to agriculture and senator cochran. but i wish my good friend from california would  pursue this amendment. to the extent that every single request that has come forth from nih. centers for disease control. every single addon that has been requested. if indeed it has been sent over from the house for aids research. it has been granted. there is really hing further that money is going to do insofar as the problem is concerned. both the senate and the house have been 100 percent sympathetic to what needs to be done in this area. quite frankly. rather than go through a point of order. this is  authorizedi believe that is still within the province of the chairman of the committeei would just like to assure my good friend from california that i am as committed as he is to this area. and. believe me. request for ey has been turned down. this is  going to further the achievement of the end that the senator desires. and i hope he would  pursue this.
. i want to respond to my good friend from west virginia. first. i compliment him for pursuing the cancer center in west virginia. also to express along with .him my admiration both for the senior senator from west virginia and his deceased wife and say what a wonderful thing it is to see this institution named after her. indeed. the subject matter was discussed in detail during the course of the conference and it was the intention of the conferees that such sums as are in the bill and mentioned by the senator go for the construction of that center. i think it was a job well done. for all the tributes in the sense of our wordsand they are well meant alsosomething like this is a lasting tribute.
. i want to express my sincere appreciation to congressman bill natcher. the chairman of the house subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies. the passage of this conference report would  have been possible without his steady hand at the helm. it takes dedication to the job and compassion for the needs of those affected by this appropriation bill. bill natcher has both and it is always a pleasure to work with him and his colleagues in the house.
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1984 public witness hearings on thursday. april 28. friday. april 29. monday. may 2. and conclude on tuesday. may 3. these hearings will be preceded by a hearing on wednesday. april 27 when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is tuesday. march 15. all requests must be in writing and should be addressed to me in care of the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd186. washington. d.c. those persons whose requests are received by march 15 will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be friday. may 6. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and 3 copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
. the legislation which i am introducing today authorizes the secretary of health and human services to accept accreditation by the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities (carp) in determining the medicare eligibility of outpatient rehabilitation facilities. the bill simply gives the secretary the discretion to recognize carp accreditation in lieu of certification by a state medicare agency. under present law. all rehabilitation agencies and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities which provide medicare services must be certified by state medicare agencies. each year. the state agency must survey each facility and certify that it meets the standards required to be a medicare provider. this process insures that beneficiaries under the program are receiving the quality services to which they are entitled. many of the same facilities which must undergo annual surveys by their state agencies also seek accreditation by carp. carp is a private. profit organization established by and for the field of rehabilitation to adopt and supply standards in facilities throughout the united states. rehabilitation facilities seek carf accreditation because it is a symbol of excellence among health care professionals and the public. in order to receive carps approval. strict adherence to quality service is required. carp surveys are conducted by recognized experts who are kledgeable in the delivery of services to individuals with disabilities. surveyors are selected based on their familiarity with the particular type of programs operated by the facility requesting accreditation. site survey teams spend approximately 11/2 days in the facility applying the standards and making a determination of the specific strengths and weaknesses of the facility and program with respect to the standards. a detailed survey report is then prepared. the report goes to the carp board of trustees which makes the final accreditation decision. the commissions member organizations have grown over the years to include a number of national organizations involved in rehabilitation. these members. which effectively provide a broad base of representation of the various segments and points of view in rehabilitation. include: the american hospital association. goodwill industries of america. inc.. the national easter seal society. the national rehabilitation association. and the united cerebral palsy associations. inc. the board of trustees of the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities is composed of representatives of these members. plus atlarge trustees appointed by the board. a few years ago. some of the sponsoring members of carp asked the secretary of health and human services to create "deemed status" for carpaccredited facilities. the officials at the health care financing administration (hcfa) who undertook the long and tedious process of evaluating and comparing them with medicare regulations for outpatient providers were impressed with the commissions standards. the director of health standards and quality bureau indicated that carfs program is "an effective standardization instrument and is symbolic of the excellence of your total organization. efforts directed toward improving the quality of rehabilitation services." in the final analysis. however. hcfa officials indicated that they were precluded by statute from granting "deemed status" to carp. hcfa based its decision on an opinion by the office of general counsel which stated that the "failure to provide the authority" was apparently "an oversight on the dart of congress. rather than a conscious choice." my bill would give the secretary the discretion to accept carf accreditation if it is determined that carfs standards meet the criteria. in the medicare regulations. it would  mandate the secretary to do so. furthermore. if "deemed status" is established for carfaccredited facilities. those facilities which are  carf accredited could continue to provide medicare services as long as they are certified by the state medicare agency. the measure. if approved. would simply eliminate the need for outpatient rehabilitation facilities to undergo two essentially duplicative surveys. this would  only save the facilities administrative expenses incurred from site surveys. but would also reduce unnecessary government expenditures. my bill has been endorsed by the national easter seal society. the easter seal society of connecticut. inc.. and the seven easter seal rehabilitation centers in the state of connecticut.e by mr. percy (by request):
. the amendment of the distinguished senator from utah is acceptable to the majority. i k of the senators interest in this matter of home health care and training personnel adequate to meet the new requirements of the law. and i am delighted to join him in this endeavor.
. i intend to be relieving the distinguished senator from oregon at his chair in this matter. when i take over that chair. i intend to raise the section on laborhhs. with all the education amendments. science amendments. health amendments. and everything else. if one is here. i am going to go ahead and pass them as controversial amendments. so anybody that has any problem with that section--it is the biggest section with the exception of defense on the billhe better get on the floor. because in 1 hours time i intend to be done with my section of this bill.
. i want to call my colleagues attention to a particularly significant item within the billamendment  144 to h.r. 3069under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on labor. health. and human services. and education and related agencies. i want to emphasize the need for a research and training center focusing on pediatric rehabilitation needs and reiterate the directive in the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report that this center be located at the university of connecticut. furthermore. the bill addresses the unique rehabilitation needs of the pacific basin and establishes a research and training center in this area. the conferees directed that this center be located at the university of hawaii. the need for the establishment of these two centers is reflected  only by this supplemental appropriations bill. but is also clearly addressed in the provisions of s. 1340. the rehabilitation amendments of 1983. s. 1340. passed by the senate on july 26. specifically authorizes a pediatric and a pacific basin research and training center. the committee report for s. 1340 likewise directs that the pediatric rehabilitation center be located at the university of connecticut and that the pacific basin center be located at the university of hawaii. by affirming the need for tnese two centers in two separate bills. and specifying their location in both reports. we have clearly indicated our intent regarding the establishment of pediatric and pacific basin research and training centers. following enactment of this supplemental. the administration should act expeditiously to establish these two vitally needed research and training centers at the two locations directed by congress.
. currently in 42 u.s.c. 165. the basic enabling legislation for saint elizabeths hospital. there is a provision concerning the duties and responsibilities of the superintendent of the hospital which mandates that lie shall reside on the piemises". this is an archaic provision in law that dates back to the 19th century and was appropriate for an era when modern communications systems. available today. were existent or scarce. the superintendent and other physiclans and - psychiatrists critical to the operation of the hospital are accessible and on call through telephones and "beeper" contact 24 hours a day. also. the hospital follows an administrative rotation procedure where the superintendent and chief hospital administrators share. on a rotation basis. weekend and holiday assignment coverage. the continued requirement that the superintendent must reside on the premises is longer justified. with the arrival of new superintendent. this archaic provision needs to be rectified. therefore. at the request of the department. this amendment is offered which states. again. repeating the amendment asit was read: during fiscal year 1984 and thereafter the superintendent of saint elizabeths hospital may reside off the premises of the hospital. withstanding section 4839 of the revised statutes (42 u.s.c. 165).
. i do  believe in standing here and making speeches for appearances sake. so i will tell you exactly what my feelings are with respect to the amendment of the distinguished senators from georgia and arkansas. i understand fully the problem to which you are directing your energies and your cuts. i would like to examine it. you have my word that i will. but i think that it has to be done in .more judicious way because i do  believe that you really mean to achieve that which will be achieved under terms of this amendment. this amendment will strike directly at the national institutes of health. the national cancer institute. the heart and lung institutes. the national institute on arthritis. diabetes. and digestive ind kidney diseases. alcohol and mental iaealth programs. and the centers for disease control. much of their work is being done by consultants. i can believe that is what you want to accomplish with this amendment. i have problem with a welldirected amendment relative to consultants. i do  like them any better than you do. so. in a sense of giving the chairman a message. you have done that. i hope the amendment will be withdrawn on my assurance that i will work with you in achieving an amendment which we will put on an appropriations bill in this regard. in the absence of thatand i hope that is the way we can dispose of the amendmentyes. i can take it to conference. since i have already expressed my opinion on the amendment. you can take it from there. i really do  have much further to say about this subject. i compliment both sponsors of the amendment. again. i repeat. you make a valid point. and as long as we can rifleshot it instead of having a shotgun approach. i have problem dealing with this problem in a positive way in the next appropriations bill.
. i say to my distinguished friend from massachusetts. one feels more strongly than this senator on this matter. i might add that it was the subject of some rather intense questioning when the secretary of the health and human services appeared before the appropriations subcommittee. it was the subject of some rather intense followup letters requesting the reappearance of the secretary before the subcommittee. it was at that time. as the senaitor well ks. that the administration indicated that it had a plan on this matter. the administration indicated that it was expecting to agree upon a health plan for the unemployed. it was only on that assurance that the subcommittee withheld any action. of course. the plan that came foth from mr. stockman a little later onthat is. that the unemployed should go ahead and pay their own health premiumswas  exactly what was envisioned by this senator or. i am sure. by the senator from massachusetts. so. insofar as the problem is concerned and the attention that should be devoted to it. those thoughts expressed by the senator from massachusetts have the complete concurrence of the senator from connecticut. i would hope that the matter would  find its way onto this bill only in the sense that i gather there still is work to be done on it. senator dole *and others with authorizing responsibility are obviously going to have to be ipart of the scenario of a solution. and. again. i can only implore my good friend  to jeopardize the passage of this bill. the first in 5 years. but. krather to try to work it out in the reg. ular process. i assure the senator he is igoing to have my full support on any -matter that comes to this floor along these lines.
the senator has the assurance of this senator. in whatever role he plays. that i would support him in getting that kind of an upordown vote. the senator is also going to have my support  just to have an upordown vote. but against any proposal that calls for the unemployed to pay their own health premiumns. that is unacceptable. it is to me. it is to the senator from massachusetts. so the senator can also rest assured that on the substance of the matter he is going to have the support of this senator.
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1985 public witness hearings on thursday. april 12. tuesday. april 24. wednesday. april 25. thursday. april 26. and conclude on tuesday. may 1. these hearings will be preceded by a hearing on wednesday. april 11 when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is wednesday. march 7. all requests must be in writing and should be addressed to me in care of the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd131. washington. d.c. 20510. those persons whose requests are received by march 7 will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be friday. may 4. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and three copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
. blacks fought side by side with whites to safeguard these truths: that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. that among these life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. the resolution i am introducing today recognizes their contributions and encourages government at all levels. and private organizations too. to appropriately remember these individuals. more than 200 years have passed. but their unselfishness and heroism stand as an important monument to the american ideal of freedom. i urge my colleagues to join me in giving tribute to these unsung americans.6 by mr. lautenbero (for himself. mr. dole. and mr. pell): s.j. res. 222. joint resolution de.signating the month of june 1984 as "student awareness of drunk driving month." to the committee on the judiciary.
. in the present regulatory climate where each major payer of health services. including the federal and state governments. is aggressively pursuing cost control. it is essential that the distribution of health services  become a function of formula regulation. the explosion in total revenues spent for health care has  resulted in equal availability. medically underserved areas continue
. i should like to address myself further if i may. to matters contained in the amendment before us. specifically to explain that aspect of the amendment which relates to the increased funding. which. in turn. could translate into additional dollars for both education and health. my emphasis being on the health side of it. it is true that i was one of the original sponsors of the chafeewelcker amendment. in that amendment. we sought.  1. to redirect priorities in the sense of reducing defense spending and upping the funding for health and education in the same dollars. or  in the same amountso that. indeed. what would be effected would be a reduction in the deficit. we would accomplish both a reduction in defense spending. a less than equivalent amount of money then going back into health and education. with the total dollars being less and. therefore. a reduction in the deficit. the amendment also called for one cap in order that defense would  be isolatsd in the course of the appropriations committees determination. that is what we lost by one vote. we went back to the drawing boards and talked to the leadership on this side. that. in essence. resulted in what we have before us. with two able changes. first. we are back to a twocap situation. and. second. defense dollars were  reduced. am i disappointed in the fact that we still have two caps. the answer is yes. hing was accomplished on that score. however. on the matter of defense dollars. as a practical matter. i would expect that the conference procedure and the position of the house will have some impact on the senate numbers. in other words. during the course of the entire legislative process. i would suspect that the reduction in defense dollars will be even greater than that proposed in the chafeewelcker amendment. we are. in effect. doing in two steps what that amendment did in one. with the exception of the cap situation.  the question has been raised on the matter of the education and health moneys. how did we ever guarantee that the moneys sought by senator bradley and senator stafford and senator weicker. those moneys that relate to education and health. will come forth in the numbers that had been discussed and agreed upon. i shall let senator stafford speak for himself. but i can address myself to the health numbers. i can also address myself to the general situation as it relates to the appropriations committee. the chairman . the chairman of the education subcommittee . and myself as chairman of the laborhhs committee. neither senator hatfield. as chairman of the full committee.  i as chairman of the laborhhs committee can stand here on the floor and deliver the votes of the members of our committee and subcommittee respectively. we can do that. so that. obviously. as a legal technical matter. there is still a question mark there. however. the distinguished chairman of the full committee has given me his word that he will do everythingas indeed he already had before this compromise was every arrived atto see that the figures for health funding would be at the level which i had set forth visavis the preparation of the chafeeweicker amendment and as had been envisaged in the amendment of the distinguished senator from new jersey. hing has changed. i still have the word of the chairman of the appropriations committee. i give my word to my colleagues that i expect to get those numbers out of my subcommittee. . there is fakery here. i do  want to get my good friend.from new mexico mad because i do  want by implication to indicate there was any fakery in the original figures. but i will say this. that during the negotiating process the administration indicatedif i may have the attention of the distinguished senator from new jerseythat the moneys would be supplied by some changes that could be found later on down the line. and that was  satisfactory to either me or to the senator froni the appropriations committee because that we have control over. and i mean e. we are  even a vote in that process. we rejected that approach. so we specifically received a commitment for $2 billion additional to go into the ap. propriations process. of which we are a part and where we can vote as individuals. i want the record to be clear that my position on the $650 million for biomedical research. as stated in the subcommittee hearings. as envisaged in the preparation of chafeeweicker. ac presented to the chairman and the republican leadership in the drafting of the baker compromise. has  changed one iota. will  change one iota in the weeks ahead as the appropriations committee does its work. the senator from. new jersey and my colleagues within this chamber on both sides of the aisle have my word as a senator. as chairman of the subcommittee of laborhhs. that those figures will be attained and will be a part of the additional moneys produced out of either synfuels or a transfer of funds. that figure of $650 million holds. and it is  subject to the whims of the executive branch but. admittedly. it is subject to the votes of my subcommittee and the full committee. and i might add those votes are going to come as much from the senators side as they are from this side. if the senator wants any other statement which i can deliver on. never mind speculative. if the senator wants any other statement to be male in terms of commitment. he hes every right to ask it and he will get it on the floor of the senate from me..
. this amendment eliminates $31.3 million from the national endowment for democracy. that we might bett.er understand exactly what the national endowment for democracy consists of. it consists of the republican national committee. the democratic national committee. the aflcio. and the chamber of commerce. that is big business. big labor. and big politics. this is a $31.3 million slush fund in order that these institutions. these four institutions. might best convey the meanings of our political beliefs to the world. i would suggest to my colleagues. and i do  intend to make a long speech. that there are many ways that we can do that without having to channel money through these particular institutions. my amendment calls for the elimination of the moneys for the endowment entirtly. it is my understanding that the senator from new hampshire has an amendment in the nature of a seconddegree amendment to call for the elimination of the moneys that go to the republican and democratic national committees. it is also my understanding that hard on the heels of this will come an amendment from the distinguish .d senator from south carollna wihich will take these moneys and transfer them into fellowships. humphrey fellowships and fulbright scholarships. that is as good a point. as any to start off with. if you want to k how democracy can communicate best. believe me. it connuniicates well through the humphrey fellowships and the fulbright scholarships. it is a matter of bringing students from all over the world to our shores and ours going abroad. can you think of a better way for this nation -to communicate than through our young people. through the idealism that they represent. communicating that. abroad. and bringing persons to our shores that they might see the greatest educational system in the world at work in a democracy. we do  need the aflcio or the republican national committee or the chamber of commerce or the democrat ic national commit t ee to do that. we do  needi any middleman. let our young people speak for what we believe in and let us show what we have to the young people of the world. as most of you k. i sit as chairman of laborhhs in the appropriations subcommittee that has charge of all financing of education. health. and science. i was talking to my good friend. dr. krause. chairman of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. malaria kills about 5 million people around the world. it is  a great problem in this country but it is in the world. we are wilhin a very short space of overcoming the disease of malaria. we are on the verge of developing an effect.ive malaria vaccine. can you imagine what. dr. krause could do with $31 million to conquer nialaria. can you think of anything better that would speak for democracy and what we are capable of doing if we could eradicate inalaria. education. science. i could go down the whole checklist. i will  take the time of my colleagues to do it. to say that yes. we can certainly present a face to the world that will have people believing in our system. but we do  need t lie middlemen of tie republican national committee or the chamber of commerce or the aflcio or the democratic national committee. i understand. for example. if you want to k how ridiculous these little projects are. the chamber of commerce. in using their funds last year. used ned funds for travel to international conferences in stockholm. bonn. and brussels. can anybody tell me why bonn. stockholm. and brussels need any lessons in democracy.
. i would like to bring my colleagues attention to a report just completed by my staff on the subcommittee on the handicapped. this report is the result of visits across the country to federally funded institutions for mentally retarded persons. it is a report which documents abuse and neglect. lack of prdgramming. and inappropriate placement in these institutions as national problems. these are institutions which receive $2.3 billion federal dollars per year. i would also like to submit for the record the results of recent surveys of institutions by the u.s. department of health and human services. these surveys confirm the existence of nationwide problems in institutions for mentally retarded people. in a joint hearing this morning before the subcommittee on the handicapped and the appropriations subcommittee on labor/hhs/education and related services. secretary heckler confirmed the existence of these problems in our nations institutions. i intend to continue investigations of these institutions by the subcommittee on the handicapped. i will also pursue legislative proposals to address these problems. i urge my colleagues to join me in addressing these problems and securing appropriate treatment and safe living conditions for our nations mentally retarded citizens.
. this amendment adds $2 million to the health care financing administration [hcfa] appropriation to provide for increased monitoring of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded eicmprs]. in order to improve the quality of care provided to the residents of these institutions. this $2 million would enable hcfa to hire 45 additional developmental disability and health care personnel who would be responsible for surveying icfmrs on an annual basis to ensure that federal certification standards are being met. earlier this year. members ofmy staff visited seven icmfrs nationwide. and found substandard conditions. including overuse of medication and physical restraints. lack of active treatment. physical surroundings that were barren at best and life threatening at worst. residents living in institutions who appropriately belong in the community. and. at every institution. superintendents reported abuse of patients. in july. secretary heckler testified before my joint handicapped and laborhhseducation subcommittees hearing that recent hhs visits to 17 icfmrs found everyone operating under substandard conaitions. at the conclusion of the hearing. i requested that secretary heckler determine how much in the way of financial resources and personnel would be necessary to survey these institutions in order to obtain compliance with certification standards. hhs  estimates $2 million is necessary to accomplish these surveys. with these additional funds. hcfa will be able to survey all institutions with 300 or more residents. 40 percent of institutions with 16 to 299 residents. and 20 percent of icfmrs with 15 or fewer individuals. our nations institutionalized mentally retarded deserve the highest quality of care that we can provide. and this amendment would be a first step toward ensuring that they receive that level of care. i urge adoption of this amendment.
. my amendment does  increase the community health center appropriation. but rather allows funds  used to pay the salaries of federal assignees under the nhsc to be used instead to make supplemental grants to health centers to help them meet the cost of hiring the nhsc obligees. without such language. the complete burden of payment rests with the health centers. who too often in the past have had to cut back on health and preventive services in order to meet nhsc conversion costs.
. i certainly share the deep concern of the senator from california that we remain committed to the goal of finding the means to treat and ultimately prevent aids. and i am pleased to reassure the senator that his understanding is correct. i have been advised by the department of health and human services that out of the nih appropriation in the bill nih would use at least $15.431 million more for the aids research than the $45.663 million originally planned for that purpose in the administrations fiscal year 1985 budget. thus. under the committee bill there is a total of at least $61.094 million in the nih appropriation for aids.
. i share the senators concern for  only his state. but for citizens in other areas of the country. to what extent is the centers for disease control [cdc] actively involved in a program to remedy this public health problem.
i appreciate the senators kind words and i am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the cirids. this is a congressionally mandated program that the committee feels has been highly successful and should continue to receive strong support. in answer to the senators inquiry. the committee believes that its bill does provide the latitude for the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to create new cirids. the committee recognizes that the frequency and characteristics of immuogic diseases vary among different regions of the country and among different ethnic groups. the committee also believes dissemination of information in the area served by a cirid is a vital function of these centers. the committee would therefore be pleased if the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases found that it would be appropriate to establish new cirids. with consideration s1i1704 given to geographic distribution of the centers.
. i believe it is necessary to clarify the legislative history with respect to the appropriations bill we are considering today. on june 29. 1984. the senate committee on appropriations reported an original bill. s. 2836 senate report 98544. making appropriations for the departments of labor. health and human services. education. and related agencies. at the time of reporting that legislation. the committee also authorized us to offer committee amendments to any housepassed bill which we might subsequent ly recve. thus. h.r. 6028 has been printed to reflect the action of tile appropriations committee on s. 2836. the amendments of the committee which have been considered nerely riflet our (arlier commit tee considerat ion. because the two bills are identical in substance. the report of the commit tee on s. 2836 also governs the intent of the appropriations committee with respect to the amendments offered by the committee to ii.r. 60218. we. therefore. expect that the departments and agencies funded by this legislation will follow the guidance of the committee as provided in seinatie report 98544.
. the senator from california and i. in a colloquy last friday. stated our concerns for adequate funding for aids research. i remain committed to the goal of finding the means to treat and ultimately prevent this devastating disease. i am. therefore. prepared to accept this amendment which adds $11.2 million to the centers for disease control. $2.606.000 to the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases. and $822.000 for the alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health admiristration. these funds are to be used to intensify the efforts being made in aids research and surveiliance.
. i want to point out to my colleagues what will be involved if indeed we go to the continuing resolution rather than to pass this bill as we  have it before us. as to the department of labor. the job corps. there is a $34 million difference between this bill and the house continuing resolution. and without these funds. program quality would suffer by increasing the size of the classes. and caselopds of counselors and supervisors. 2.400 enrollees would be cut. community service employment for older americaos. $17 million would he denied as between this bill and the house continuing resolution. the addition of 3.400 jobs for the lowincome ellerly would be denied. health and human services. miternal and child health. the house continuing resolution is $79 million low the bill on the floor here ii t le senate. services for crippled childrt n. the provision of newborn gevntic screening. sudden infant death s rvices. lead poisoning prevention scivices. and prenatal medical services are. among others. provided through allocations to the states. and those allocations would be reduced by $79 million. these are the people who would suffer by virtue of accepting the house continuing resolution compared to the senate bill. community health services. $8.650.000 below the senate bill. kssential prevent ioiented primary care services for the medically underserved populations provided for more than 4.700.000 people in 1974. the senate mark would permit service to be provided to aher 350.000. that would be denied if we go to the continuing resolution. health resources and services administration. we could train 1.100 new doctors in family medicine. including geriatrics. we could support 1.700 more r(eidents in general internal medicine and pediatrics than were funded in 1984. the senate bill calls for the establishment of 24 new geriatric academic administrative units in universities. specifically to train doctors in nil aspects ol geriatric medicine. that is  includee in the house continuing resolution. we could provide for 9 new area health education center projicts which. added to the 10 continuntion projects. would cover 19 states with a geographic area of 420 counties and a total population of 41 million people in primarily rural areas who lack adequate health services. that is  in the house continuing resolution. it is in the senate bill. four thousand two hundred more disadvantaged students would be able to receive financial assistance to become health professionals. 3.000 more students would be able to receive advanced nurse training. 1.000 more students would be able to enroll in the professional nurse traineeship program under the senate bill. 160 more people would receive traineeships in order to assist them to become nurse anesthetists. the senate bill provides $5 million to establish the center for nursing research. funds were provided in 1984 to support programs on educational and clinical nursing restarch. training. and information disseminat ion. head start: the senate bill is $79.309.000 more than the house continuing resolution. these funds would permit enrolling 32.000 more children in head start. denial of this money would require a cut of 1.000 children below the level currently served. nutrition for the elderly. $15.301.000 less than the house continuing re:.olution. the average number of meals per day served to needy elderly persons could be increased by 32.000. without these funds. the. current level of 806.000 average daily meals could  be sustained due to the impact of inflation. lowincome energy assistance with winter coming on. $65 million more than the house continuing resolution. these funds repri sent a 3percent increase over last years level. in order to offset rising energy costs. without thesc funds. fewer lowincome people will be provided assistance in meeting fuel bills this winter these additional funds would serve an estimated 300.000 households. refugeetargeted assist ance. $27.500.000. targeted assist ance funds would be limited to $50 million. a onethird reduction from fiscal year 1984. targeted assistance funds serve localit ies highly impacted by heavy concentrat ions of refugees. community services block grant. $20.272.000 more than the house continuing resolution. it is estimated an additional 1.1 million impoverished people would be served with the higher amount in the senate bill. 40 new community action agencies would be open to provide antipoverty programs in unserved areas. compensatory education for the disadvantaged: $16.6 million more in the senate bill than the house cont inuing resolution. and the lower house amount results in approximately 220000 fewer migrant children. and 12.000 fewer handicapped children in state institutions being served. libraries: $63 million. the house bill provides increase in public library service. and completely eliminates federal matching funds for library construction reatijn. the senate bill includes mathscience funds. $200 million. includes desegregation assistance. $75 million. includes the special olympics as presented by the distinguished senator from utah. these are all in the senate bill. i think maybe this is the place to draw the line on the issue that has brought us to this impasse. once again. we have a prayerinschool amendment. if everybody wants to go ahead and pray that things are going to work out all right for the poo-. for the homeless. for the diseased. and for the retarded. go ahead and do so. i am sure it has its effect but i suggest that a few dollars are necessary to accomplish the ends of giving them a better life. hope for the future. and. indeed. in many cases. life itself. . that is what this bill is about. it is the united states of america speaking from its heart to those who need our special care. to the smallest. and to the least powerful of our citizensthe least powerful in the sense of their physical condition. mental condition. ecoics. or whatever. prayer is a powerful thing. and we all believe in it. let each one do his own thing. but that is  going to help these people. what is needed is dollars. what is needed is programs. and what is needed is people committed to their neighbor. in the some 25 days of hearings that took place. i wish all of you could have shared those moments with the committee and with those persons afflicted with certain diseases king that their only hope for life for either themselvesbecause many of them spoke for themselvesor for their children. or loved oneslay with the united states of america with its national institutes of health. and with the various programs going on in the universities of this nation. jod. how hard it is to fight for a few pennies for life in this nation compared to the billions we spend on destruction. but  we come down to the ultimate pray your way out of it. this is one of the finest work products to come out of this body in this session in terms of the hope that it delivers to so many. whether tihe hope is in terms of an education. or whether the hope is the financial help necessary to achieve that education. i mention in here the fact that this bill calls for the establishment of 24 new geriatric academic administrative units in the universities. do you realize at the present time in this nation we only have two such units in our universities that arc dedicated to geriatrics. do you understand the rapid multiplication that is going on right  as to our elderly ppulation. and that we are totally unprepared for it. only 2 out of the some 123 university medical complexes arc devoted to the specialty of geriatrics. i hope. again. staff will provide me with the exact figures as to what is happening to the elderly population in the united states by the year 2000. and the year 2010. the figures are staggering. we can all sit there and admire our parents. and those growing old around us. but i suggest to you again we had better do something instead of either packing them off to nursing homes or telling them to get down on their knees and say a prayer. it seems to me we can do something. that is what this bill provides for. i think many of us felt there was something special to the bill in the sense it was  just appropriating money the old way. but again foreseeing the complexities of the future. and preparing in terms of the elderly of this nation.
. if the senate increase of $80.400.000 for head start is ultimately enacted in law. as i hope it will be. there will be plenty of room to accommodate utilizing $1.600.000 for the bia projects. these projects would naturally have to compete with other aplications for head start expansion funding. but given the set of circumstances described by the senator from mississippi. i would expect the department of health and human services to give them every possible opportunity for full and fair consideration.
. i do  have any direct jurisdiction within my subcommittee. that belongs to agriculture and senator cochran. but i wish my good friend from california would  pursue this amendment. to the extent that every single request that has come forth from nih. centers for disease control. every single addon that has been requested. if indeed it has been sent over from the house for aids research. it has been granted. there is really hing further that money is going to do insofar as the problem is concerned. both the senate and the house have been 100 percent sympathetic to what needs to be done in this area. quite frankly. rather than go through a point of order. this is  authorizedi believe that is still within the province of the chairman of the committeei would just like to assure my good friend from california that i am as committed as he is to this area. and. believe me. request for ey has been turned down. this is  going to further the achievement of the end that the senator desires. and i hope he would  pursue this.
. i want to respond to my good friend from west virginia. first. i compliment him for pursuing the cancer center in west virginia. also to express along with .him my admiration both for the senior senator from west virginia and his deceased wife and say what a wonderful thing it is to see this institution named after her. indeed. the subject matter was discussed in detail during the course of the conference and it was the intention of the conferees that such sums as are in the bill and mentioned by the senator go for the construction of that center. i think it was a job well done. for all the tributes in the sense of our wordsand they are well meant alsosomething like this is a lasting tribute.
. i want to express my sincere appreciation to congressman bill natcher. the chairman of the house subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies. the passage of this conference report would  have been possible without his steady hand at the helm. it takes dedication to the job and compassion for the needs of those affected by this appropriation bill. bill natcher has both and it is always a pleasure to work with him and his colleagues in the house.
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1986 public witness hearings on thursday. may 2. tuesday. may 7. wednesday. may 8. thursday. may 9. and conclude on tuesday. may 14. these hearings will be preceeded by a hearing on wednesday. may 1 when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is friday. march 15. all requests must be in handwriting and should be addressed to me in care of the labor health and human services education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd131. washington. dc. those persons whose requests are received by march 15 will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for. those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be tuesday. may 21. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and three copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
. the end of this month marks the retirement from yale university of a man who has done much to effect a solid and productive partnership between yale and its local. state. and federal governments. that man. louis j. kaplan. associate medical dean for community. government relations. and alumni affairs. has since 1965 worked tirelessly as an advocate for biomedical research and medical education. in increasingly responsible positions at yale. lou has been an invaluable resource for connecticuts elected officials on the activities of the university community in particular and the needs of medicine in general. active in human services work since he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from new york university. lou began his career with yotingsters at the madison square boys club in new york city. and he never lost his sensitivity to or concern for the individual. whether working to improve services to connecticuts mentally ill. communicating the needs of miity students to the medical school. or marshaling the resources of yale to meet the health needs of the hill community. lou acted because he saw an individual in need. while at the university his concerns expanded to the whole range of medical service questions and it is due. in small part to his efforts. that one of our nations comprehensive cancer centers is established at the university. i commend lou kaplan for the many and critical insights he has provided me and my colleagues over the years. his careful and considered competence have contributed substantially to the improved quality of life we all seek.e
ial commissions recommendation. congress passed the mental health systems act. which provided protection and advocacy services to these citizens. but this legislation was repealed with the passage of the 1981 budget act. which replaced most federal mental health programs with a block grant. in effect. passage of the protection and advocacy for mentally ill persons act of 1985 will restore to the mentally ill the protection we have already recognized as essential for their full citizenship. as we have seen. the interests of tranquility and secrecy require that the voices within these walls be muffled and the truth. where it is told. be related in whispers between agonized family members and isolated advocates. in this climate the clear and insistent demands of the constitution and federal statutes exist as little more than rumors of hope. this condition may fit well the passivity of this administrations legal officers or the bottom line of some state budgeteers. but it must longer reflect the attitude of the congress toward a group of our most dependent citizens. . i urge my colleagues to examine the record on these issues and join me in this vital reform. i ask unanimous consent that the protection and advocacy for mentally ill persons act of 1985. in its entirety. be printed in the record.
. through this agreement with the majority leader and the senate budget committee chairman we are maintaining our investments in better health vital community and clinical health services. and a properly trained health manpower pool. and -other dividends so vital to our. and our childrens futures.
. i rise today to urge my colleagues to support s. 974. the protection and advocacy for mentally ill persons act of 1985. on april 23. i introduced this bill as a specific response to the findings of a subcommittee on the handicapped investigation into conditions in institutions for mehtally disabled persons. this investigation and 3 days of hearings documented the tragic fact that the institutionalized mentally disabled citizens of our nation are often the victims of serious abuse and neglect. the legislation before us today will go a long way toward alleviating the intolerable situations in which too many of our mentally disabled citizens find themselves. the bill provides for the establishment of a protection and advocacy system for the mentally ill in each state. similar to the protection and advocacy system already established for our developmentally disabled citizens. it will thus afford mentally ill persons access to a system which will assist them in securing their rights which are guaranteed under federal and state statutes and the u.s. constitution. the bill also enumerates a bill of rights for the mentally illrights which currently exist as title v of the mental health systems act. this bill before us today is a bill which was developed after hours of negotiating between senators and their staffs of the committee on labor and human resources. i would particularly like to thank senator orrin hatch. chairman of the committee on labor and human resources. for his assistance and support in developing the compromise bill. which is so critical for our nations mentally ill citizens. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. and thus send a message to the nation that congress will  tolerate the abuse and neglect of the most vulnerable citizens of our country.
chairs. there was about $126 million in the bill for research on aids. which has the potential for being a real blight on civilization if it is  conquered. senator weicker told the witness. "you tell us what you want. and we will give it to you."  many people in this country will oppose that. because we all k the potential disaster that aids holds for this entire nation. so everything around here is always a matter of priorities. there are priorities that the american taxpayers do  object to seeing their money spent for. and those are to save lives and to prevent further polluting. they believe in trying to bring all the people of this country up to a high standard. so i trust and certainly hope that our colleagues will vote to table the helms amendment. becaise citizens of rural communities continue to have critical water and waste disposal needs and health needs. i believe it is crucial that the important fmha loan and grant programs be maintained at existing levels. i want to express my appreciation to my colleagues on the appropriations committee for their support of my efforts to see these funding levels continued. and to ask them  to vote to table that amendment. . i suggest the absence of a tquorum.
this is removing the text of the committee amendment regarding pay of public health service personnel. it has been discussed on the democratic side. it is just tabling this excepted committee amendment.
i share the concern of the senator. full utilization of new techniques in biotechogy should be a priority at nih. especially as they pertain to the pediatric vaccines that protect our childen from the ravages of disease. i will direct nih to report to this body as to their allocation of resources in the area and the steps they have taken toward safer and more effective immunizing agents for our children.e
 i can reconsider my concern. because to say that means a prisoner has a choice. a full range of options for his or her care. the prisoner does  have that choice. that is exactly the point i am making. they can. on their own volition. run to see any physician or exercise a choice to have whatever diet they want. the prisoner does  have those choices. the senator is imposing his standardand i respect that and i have problem with that. because i am a free man. i can fight back in a variety of ways. a prisoner is  a free person. that is the difference. that is the constitutional issue. 
. we are presently spending almost 12 percent of our gross national product on health care while millions of americans are still underserved. health planning is one of the necessary tools to ensure that this expenditure is made most wisely and for the benefit of all our citizens. i urge my colleagues to support this measure.e
. i am pleased to advise the senate that the appropriations subcommittee on labor. health and human services. education and related agencies will hold its fiscal year 1987 public witness hearings on tuesday. april 29. thursday. may 1. tuesday. may 6. thursday. may 8. tuesday. may 13. and thursday. may 15. the hearings will be preceded by a hearing on thursday april 24. when the subcommittee will take testimony from members of congress. the deadline for interested groups and individuals to submit their requests for an opportunity to testify is tuesday. march 4. all requests must be in writing and should be addressed to me in care of the labor. health and human services. education and related agencies appropriations subcommittee. sd131. washington. dc. those persons whose requests are received by march 4. will receive a letter providing instructions for their appearance before the subcommittee. in addition. the deadline for those who only wish to submit statements for the hearing record will be tuesday. may 20. such statements must be longer than seven doublespaced pages. and three copies should be sent to me in care of the subcommittee.
only our ability to spend in anticipation of greater savings has enabled us to respond to certain problems in the nation. especially. as an example. a serious disease like aids. dr. myron essex. chairman of the department of cancer biology at the havard school of public health said the following in an interview published in the new york times magazine last sunday: the centers for disease control has been trying to inform the public without overly alarming them. but we outside the government are freer to speak. the fact is that the dire predictions of those who have cried doom ever since aids appeared havent been far off the mark. there isnt just one aids virus but a score that we k ofand countless others. because it mutates at a hundred times the rate of other viruses. so. making an effective vaccine will be extremely difficult. the effects. of the virus are far wider than most people realize. in zaire. zambia. and rwanda. its been spreading rapidly by means of heterosexual intercourse. in rwanda as many women as men have aids. and infected women are giving birth to infected- babies. in short. aids is clearly a serious threat to the entire population. all is  grim on the subject of aids. last year. the congress and the administration responded to give the national institutes of health every nickel it requested to battle this disease. there are promising reports from this battlefront. precisely because we were able last year to marshal a portion. of the nations resources against this disease. but there is great danger ahead. 80 percent of the people with aids die within 2 years. this incurable disease is spreading quickly. some 8.000 americans were found to have aids in 1985. 15.000 more are expected to get a similar diagis in 1986 and the figure is expected to double again in 1987. it is vital that the nation maintain the flexibility to deal  only with this crisis. but any that presents itself. i say to my good friend from maryland. there is a great deal wrong in the sense of the deficits of this nation. there is a great deal wrong with the inability of individual congressmen and senators to stand up and be counted. and there is a great deal wrong with the american people for failure to kick out those who imbalance the budget or reward those who do balance the budget. but there is  one thing wrong with the constitution of the. united states. it sits alone in its magnificence. matter how banal our actions on the floor or how uncaring the participation of the american voters.
madam president. i am pleased that the senate will  turn to adoption of the conference report on s. 974. the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act of 1986. this bill is a landmark in the history of this nations commitment to the care and treatment of its mentally ill citizens. this bill was developed in response to a 9month senate investigation of state institutions for the mentally ill. during the course of this investigation. one thing became painfully obvious: mentally ill individuals in residential facilities are vulnerable to abuse and neglect. and all too frequently. there is effective system to protect the rights of these individuals.. the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act of 1986 takes a step toward remedying these problems. it provides for the establishment of a protection and advocacy system for the mentally ill in each state. similar to the protection and advocacy system already in existence for our developmentally disabled citizens. federal funding will be provided to the protection and advocacy agency serving the developmentally disabled. and that agency may provide services directly to mentally ill persons. or it may subcontract with an existing state or private profit entity currently engaged in the provision of advocacy services. the protection and advocacy agency will have the authority to receive and investigate complaints of abuse and neglect. and to pursue administrative and legal remedies to ensure the protection of mentally ill individuals. ten million dollars in fiscal year 1986 are already available for fiscal year 1986 to carry out this act. and with enactment of this bill. we expect that these funds will be released expeditiously to begin this new program. i urge the senate to adopt this conference report. as the house overwhelmingly did yesterday. in order to protect its most vulnerable citizens from the abuse. neglect and substandard living conditions that are too often their fate. i would also like to thank senator hatch. as chairman of the committee on labor and human resources. and representative henry waxman. chairman of the house subcommittee on health and the environment. for their determined efforts to reach a compromise of which we can all be proud.
. i am somewhat constrained to move to table this amendment. i think we have discussed it in rather great detail. i am  going to do that if it is going to offend anyone. but i have to say this. that the subject matter which we are referring to here today. in the main. has been entrusted to this senator and his subcommittee both in terms of the universities. in terms of grants to the various centers. cancer centers. alzheimer centers. various scientific endeavors. et cetera. which all falls under the aegis of the subcommittee of labor. health and human services. i and the other members of the subcommittee are well aware of our responsibilities and certainly 99 percent of what occurs under the peer review process. but to say that that does  allow the individual senators to make a case for circumstances within their state. then there is  much point in having an appropriations committee or indeed to act as a u.s. senator. i am going to tell you right . considering the status of priorities in this nation. hing delights me more than when every one of you interest yourself in a university or in a cancer center. the priorities are so damn out of whacki mean this fellow controls almost all the money in the budget for defense and it is hard to get anybody excited about the business of life. whether it is kledge. science. or whatever. the more that you do. the more that you interest yourself in these matters. the better it is for the whole budget. i think you will all agree as you have made your requests. it is  going to be a pork barrel process at all. invariably what we are talking about is helping the less fortunate. it is very little political reward for the type of matter that we are discussing here today. so. without in any way denigrating the comments of those who propose the amendment. i also have to say i am very proud of both our profession and the work that it has done within that profession insofar as the u.s. senate is concerned. there is hing to apologize for. . with those brief comments. i would hope that we could get on with the business of voting in terms of a tabling motion on the amendment. and certainly i do  want to foreclose anyone else from demanding that it is thoroughly covered.
. i am recommending a one time transfer of lowincome/lowenergy funds due to the availability of funds to the states in the exxon overcharge case. the transfer is to be to the national institutes of health for experimental drug therapy programs. i urge adoption of the amendment.
i thank the senator. i appreciate the senators leadership on this issue over the past year. and willingness at this time to seek a resolution that saves money as well as preserving the health and safety of miners. the secretarys proposed solution in my view may be an appropriate way for us to resolve this issue in conference with the house of representatives. however. for the time being. i believe most of the funding for new inspectors should be kept in the bill. and the report language approved by the appropriations committee should be retained.
i would like to thank the senator from new jersey for his interest in this question. research on the causes. prevention. and treatment of aids is essential. but. we must  forget the importance of getting new .and updated information to health workers as quickly as possible. i believe that a timely flow of current information on aids research and developments in the field is vital * to the success of the effort against this disease and more should be done.
. much will be said during the course of the debate about affecting the drug problem through additional law enforcement and harsher punishments. the fact remain that i firmly believe the three most important areas are.  1. education with respect to the young.  2. scientific research as to the problem of addiction.  3. the matter of rehabilitation. the amendment that the senate has before it  addresses the area of scientific research. and i think it is rather dramatic insofar as its subject matter is concerned. the amendment urges the alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health administration to pursue research on neuronal receptors. rather than do a bad job as a layman in describing the subject matter. i will read a letter addressed to me by dr. donald ian macdonald. the administrator of the alchol. drug abuse. and mental health administration. i hope senators will be patient with me. because i think they will understand. on the basis of what is said here.  1. the complexity of this drug problem and.  2. how it eventually will be resolved. the letter reads: dear : it was a pleasure meeting with you yesterday. as we discussed. research into the neurobiological bases of drug abuse has been both a stimulus to and beneficiary of recent advances in the understanding of the brain and behavior. i appreciate your interest and would like to take this opportunity to elaborate further on this subject and its critical significance in addressing the drug abuse crisis both in the united states and abroad. the brain is composed of billions of individual nerve cells. these nerve cells come in a variety of specialized forms and are arranged in distinct functional units. the functions of these nerve cells depend on: (1) their location in the brain. (2) their degree of specialization. (3) the kinds of substances they ordinarily use to communicate with each other. (4) the manner in which they are grouped together in bundles (nuclei). and (5) how they are wired together (nerve tracts). for example. your eye is made up of specialized nerve cells that are particularly responsive to light. the visual information received by the eye is sent to other parts of the brain composed of nerve cells dedicated to receiving and processing information about the world around us. a similar description can be made for the other special sensory organs (ear. e. tongue. etc.) that tell us about our immediate environment. but whatever their specialized (or general) nature. the characteristic that these nerve cells have in common is their capacity for transmitting "information" in the form of electrical energycalled a nerve pulsefrom one cell to aher. moving from the "geography" of nerve cells. e.g. how they are grouped or wired together. to the cellular level. we see that nerve cells are separated from one aher by a small space called a synapse. a nerve impulse must cross this gap to create a "closed circuit" if the brain is to perform any of its multitudis functions. this "circuit closing" or bridging function is performed by chemical substances produced by the brain that are called neurotransmitters. these substances are released from the end terminals of a messagesending (presynaptic) cell. cross over the synaptic gap. and make contact with the messagereceiving (postsynaptic) cell which is next in line along the pathway. this physical activity which takes only the minutest fraction of a second to complete (and is occurring in millions of cells simultaneously) is responsible for the most complexhuman thought processes and the most elemental human behaviors. how is the message from one nerve cell to aher actually received at the molecular level where the substances released by the presynaptic cell interact with the postsynaptic cell. it is made possible by specialized structures on the "postsynaptic cell. called receptors. these receptors are activated by specific neurotransmitters which generate a new nerve impulse in a postsynaptic cell to which they are connected. (this is analogous to a key being able to open a specific lock if the fit is "just right.") in order for the nerve impulse to be turned off (so that the specific activity engendered by the nerve impulse does  continue on indefinitely) the neurotransmitters are almost immediately inactivated by a variety of mechanisms shortly after they have created the circuit which delivers the "message." abused drugs and alcohol exert their deleterious influence on brain function by interfering with a number of the mechanisms described above. they. interfere with: (1) the transmission of the nerve pulse within an individual cell. (2) the release of neurotransmitters. (3) the inactivation of neurotransmitters. and (4) the receptor themselves. it is precisely these processes that scientists are studying when performing research on drug effects on the brain through highly sophisticated methodologies and creative techniques. unfortunately. it is both figuratively and literally true that when people abuse drugs they are performing "experiments" on themselves to alter their brain function (with unforseeable consequences). the results are sometimes merely unpleasant. and  infrequently disastrous. with this as background. i would like to discuss recent discoveries with direct relevance to the problems of heroin and cocaine addiction. in the early 1970s it was generally assumed that opiate drugs. such as heroin. must act on the nervous system through specific receptors in nerve cells. at that time a search was undertaken for these receptors. and in 1973 several groups of scientists discovered the "opiate receptor." all drugs have specific chemical shapes or configurations. the opiate receptor is specialized to be activated by only one class of drugs. going back to the analogy used earlier. if you view drugs as keys and receptors as locks. then the opiate receptor (lock) will only allow opiate drugs (keys) to fit the slot. this discovery immediately explained aher phee that scientists had observed for some time. that there were drugs called opiate antagonists that actually blocked the effects of heroin. it was very clear that while all opiatelike drugs might fit the slot.  all had the exact configuration to turn the key (and activate the cell). some drugs (i.e. the antagonists) while occupying the slot. permitted other keys. such as heroin. to have access to the lock. this concept opened up whole new avenues of research into the development of drugs with specific abilities to block. antagonize. or minimize undesirable effects of opiate drugs. with the discovery of the opiate receptor. scientists theorized that the brain must contain some internally produced. opiatelike chemicals to activate it. it did  seem reasonable that the evolutionary process had created a special cell in the brain that was responsive only to substances which are found in nature in certain limited areas of the globe (i.e. the poppy plant). indeed. in the midseventies a whole variety of endoges (the scientific term for chemicals made by the body) opiatelike substances called enkephalins. were discovered. this finding. as well as the discovery of the opiate receptor. was made entirely by adamha supported scientists. that is adamha. that is our unit. our governmental unit. if you will. the alcohol. drug abuse and mental health administration. of which dr. macdonald is the head. as is so often the case in basic research and kledge development. the discovery of endoges opiatelike drugs had implications for a wide variety of other biomedical areas. essentially every research program at the nih is  supporting research in this and related areas. the possible benefits of this research include the treatment of high blood pressure. stroke. obesity. and pulmonary disease. current drug abuse research is also aimed at attempting to understand the genetic mechanisms which control and regulate opiate receptors and endoges opiatelike substances. one hypothesis being investigated is that some people may be particularly vulnerable to opiate addiction because of an abmality in their endoges opiate system. for example. it is thought that the opiate system may play a role in mood regulation. some people may  secrete egh enkephalins (one of the endoges opiatelike substances referred to above) to feel "mal". and they may be particularly at risk of becoming addicted if they are exposed to outside (exoges) opiates like -heroin. in a sense. some addicts may be conceptualized as having an enkephalin deficiency syndrome in a similar way to which a diabetic suffers from inadequate insulin availability. i must emphasize that this is only a hypothesis and in any case would  explain all of heroin addiction. while the problem with heroin has been with us for far too long. the recent epidemic of cocaine use has caused us to refocus attention on this drug. while some research is being directed at identifying a "cocaine" receptor this may  prove fruitful. we do. however. have a reasonable. if incomplete. idea about how cocaine works. as mentioned above. nerve cells communicate through the release of neurotransmitters. after performing their function the neurotransmitters are inactivated. one way in which this occurs is through a process of "reabsorption" of the neurotransmitter by the same nerve cell that released it. cocaine is a "reuptake blocker" in that it prevents this process of reabsorption and causes the neurotransmitters to remain in the synapse with constant activation of the next nerve cell in the chain. moreover. this effect of cocaine occurs at a place in the brain that appears to play a major role in modulating feelings of wellbeing as well as intense craving for the drug. this intense craving can occur in the absence of physical dependence on the drug. in fact. recent studies have shown that two distinct sites in the brain can be identified. one controlling physical dependence on drugs. and aher controlling drugseeking behavior. kledge of cocaines actions has led us to explore a number of ways of treating cocaine abuse. these have focussed on ways to counteract cocaines effect on neutrotransmitters and to replace deficiencies in neurotransmitters that can occur after chronic cocaine exposure. some of these approaches appear to hold reasonable promise of success. of course. this brief summary can only touch upon the advances made in the neurosciences as they relate to drug abuse. i anticipate major expansions of kledge and understanding in the very near future. our research program will focus on developing new prevention and treatment approaches based on fundamental kledge of brain mechanisms. for example. we are seeking to develop narcotic antagonists that will block the effects of opiate drugs for prolonged periods of time and we are developing new approaches to diminishing the intense craving and drug seeking behavior that is a part of drug addiction. as we understand more and more about the biochemical nature of the brain and the relationship between the structure of brain chemicals and behavior. we will have profound capabilities for altering human capabilities and experience. we will. in the very real sense of the word. begin to understand the essence of what we are. that is what this amendment is about. scientific research.  coming after the fact in terms of punishment or during the fact in terms of law enforcement. but indeed to the best of our scientific abilities see that there is problem to begin with or at least see that the problem is caught at its earliest stages. there is hing very dramatic about this. it really makes us think rather than appreciate the violence of either the problem of the solution. in the long term. the subject matter of this amendment is by far and away probably one of most important matters which we will include in this legislation this evening. i move adoption of the amendment.
. during this time that we have debated and discussed ways of reducing drug trafficking in our nation. and ways of increasing treatment and prevention of alcohol and drug abuse in our country. we have directed the department of health and human services. through the alcohol. drug abuse and mental health administration. to help in these efforts. specifically. we have asked the department of health and human services to assist in the new treatment programs under title iv. subtitle a and the education and preseptember 27. 1986 cois vention programs under title iv. subtitle b. we are also requiring the expansion of the current alcohol and drug abuse clearinghouses maintained at the alcohol. drug abuse and mental health administration. requiring several studies to be undertaken at the department of health and human services. and that the department of education coordinate and report to congress on state education and prevention activities. here in this bill is there a line item authority to pay for these additional and necessary activities.
i tell you why i think it would be a bad way to handle it. i think we are going to lose. i mean. my sense of priorities is somewhat different than the priorities that have been consistently acted by this session of the congress. and if we start down that road. i can tell you what is going to happen. we will maintain all the programs that you and i probably have fought against and the money is going to be taken from the alcoholic and the mentally ill. et cetera. and we will wind up exactly where we wind up . which is under my jurisdiction of education and health and science. i have $33 billion. how much does my friend from the defense committee have.
i gather the answer of the senator from massachusetts is that it is  authorized.  2. i think i should point out to my colleagues that the funds for this amendmenti find myself in a strange position of opposing both the senator and the white house. who tried to do the same thing with the drug program as the senator from massachusetts is  trying to do for health planning. taking the money out of maternal and child health care. out of nih. out of alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health. and all the rest of the programs to fund an unauthorized program. i think clearly. when we tried to craft the budget. consideration was given to the very meager funds allotted to this aspect of our national priorities. quite frankly. as an unauthorized program. this had to wait its place in line. i am sure the distinguished senator from oregon will have more to say about that later. but in any event. i think i should point out to my colleague that this money is coming out of direct help to those who are suffering from various afflictions and diseases that are treated in those very institutes from which the money comes.
a concurrent resolution commending hadassah. the womens zionist organization of america for 75 years of dedication to the high ideals shared by the jewish and american people. i ask my colleagues to join with me in commemorating the many achievements of hadassah as it celebrates its diamond jubilee tomorrow. since its funding by 12 members of the daughters of zion study circle under the direction of henrietta szold. hadassah has become the largest volunteer womens organization in the united states. boasting over 385.000 members in all 50 states and puerto rico. hadassah for 75 years has embodied the spirit of tzedakah. the hebrew word for charityand for righteousness. an act of tzedakah is an act of sharing resources and skills. of reaffirming ancient values. and renewing commitments. few organizations understand more clearly the indispensable relationship between charity. moral values. and religious obligation than hadassah. few. if any. organizations can match its extraordinary record of caring and service over the yearsa record of success that is a tribute to all who have. worked so. hard on behalf of hadassah. one of the most impressive symbols of the values shared by hadassah and its members is the outpouring of support for the land reclamation and reforestation projects in israel. through hard work and dedication. hadassah has become the single largest contributor to the jewish national fund in the worldthus giving new meaning to the ancient mandate of the prophet isaiah. that "the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them. and the desert shall rejoice. and blossom as the rose." perhaps the most impressive symbol of hadassahs commitment to israel is the hadassah medical organization in jerusalema superb facility dedicated to providing the best in health care to all who are in need. during a trip to israel last december. i had the opportunity to visit hadassah medical organizationmy first trip in over a decadeand was most impressed by the leaps of progress achieved by the hospital. i was able to tour an area of the hospital which can be converted into emergency operating rooms within minutes and had a chance to speak with the superb medical personnel and review the many advances in techogy since my last visit. it was also at hadassah that. michael shirman received his longoverdue bone marrow transplant from his sister. inna flerov. i personally worked with the soviet authorities to secure the release of irma flerov from the soviet unionwhose departure had been prevented by the soviet authorities. although the soviets resisted innas departure until a dangerously late date. we are hopeful that michael will recover fully. michael shirmans case has underscored for me in a personal way the outstanding commitment hadassah has made  only to israel. but to people in need across the earth. through its medical training prograins in africa and asia. its youth programs in the united states and in israelyouth aliyah. youth judaea and hamagshimimand so many other programs. hadassah has established itself as an indispensable part of americas support for the cause of israel. on this 75th anniversary. let me say this: may your next 75 years be even greater than your first. i urge my colleagues to support this concurrent resolution.
. i rise as a cosponsor of the bill introduced today to establish a congressional advisory panel on acquired immune deficiency syndrome [aids]. the rapid spread of a fatal disease such as aids demands that we  only provide the resources and activities necessary to limit and eventually stop the aids epidemic. but we must also ensure careful coordination and oversight of this countrys aidsrelated activities. the advisory panel established by this bill is in way intended to usurp or duplicate the efforts of any of the federal agencies. i k firsthand how much time. effort. and resources the public health service has devoted and continues to devote to aids research. disease surveillance. and epidemiology. i would also be the first to insist that congress maintain its oversight authority in these program areas. i believe congress should continue to aggressively monitor developments in the aids epidemic and carefully evaluate the federal programs designed to address this problem. but aids is a complex problem and requires the coordination of a number of different programs to address a number of different aspects of the disease. the recent report by the national academy of sciences provided a superb overview of the aidsrelated issues facing us today and outlined the directions the academy believes this country should be taking to confront aids in public health. health care. and research. i believe this kind of scientific. political report to congress provides the information congress needs to make informed responsible recommendations for all aidsrelated activities and the coordination of them. the bill introduced today ensures the continuation of such aids reports to congress over the next 5 years. the surgeon general estimates that by the end of 1991. 270.000 cases of aids will have occurred with 179.000 deaths within the decade since the disease was first recognized. the bill before the senate is a small step toward addressing such devastating numbers but it is an important step toward understanding the magnitude of the problem and how we are going to respond to a disease that has already claimed the lives of nearly 18.000 people and threatens to claim hundreds of thousands more in the future.
. the time has come for congress to clearly affirm the health of the american people. and for that matter people all over the world. as a top priority in this country. and there is more unerring measure of a countrys priorities than its budget. while this budget may  be perfect. it takes yet aher step. a very positive step. toward increasing the level of spending this country should be supporting for its health programs. support for basic biomedical research in this country has resulted in unprecedented scientific breakthroughs and advances. scientists have recently begun to identify the cause of alzheimers disease and are currently experimenting with a new drug treatment for the disease. scientists have also discovered a gene that they believe may well trigger a form of mental depression. and it was precisely our commitment to basic research that resulted in the ability of scientists to identify. isolate. and clone the aids virus in just a few short years.
. congress appropriated $413 million. it is longer just a question of azt. there are other drugs which show even greater promise than azt. but they have come to pass by virtue of our commitment. commitments of minds and money to resolving this deadly threat. it was  cheap and it is  going to be cheap to resolve it. and i can say to you that the money spent on azt will result in life for those who get it. it may . you are only prolonging the time that they can live. hoping that in the meantime something will come along to give them life. that is the theory. that is the hope. already we k that since i stood on this floor a year ago we have made even larger strides toward achieving a better chance of some form of chemoprophylactics. i repeat that is  the vaccine. the matter of the vaccine. and i will get into that. certainly is a ways off. probably sooner than the point i am trying to make is that we have responded in a traditional way toward this threat of disease. we have never asked people in the past. and we should   ask. how did you get your disease. we never passed judgment on lifestyle or any other matter. if there has been a threat we have met it. we have always spoken loudly for life in this nation. we have never asked why. we have merely understood that threat and we have gone to meet it. we have never engaged in moralistic debate over disease ever. such as is going on  in the higher echelons of the administration. we have left the conquering of diseases to the men and women of science.  to the politicians and  to the philosophers. i do  rise to oppose the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina on the basis that i am a liberal and he is a conservative. that has absolutely part in this debate. what has part in this debate is that every single credible scientific source opposes what the senator from th carolina is asking for. states rightsi am going to oppose his amendment on a states rights basis. i certainly am . may i remind you it is the administration that more than once through spokesmen has said this is really a matter of education for local school boards. and let the states decide.  it is . this is a threat posed to the united states of america. the aids virus or hiv virus has absolutely kledge of state lines or boundaries. we did  ask connecticut to go ahead and do its part in world war ii. and we did  ask texas or california to act on their own. we faced that threat as a nation. and we have to face this as a nation. why oppose mandatory testing in cases of an application for a marriage license. first of all. the implication is. with an amendment such as this. that we have a test which is completely accurate. the testing process. as indeed the chemoprophylactic drug process. as indeed the process for developing vaccine. is far from perfect. we have a good test. but in ise a perfect test. there are those that say there should be an awareness of those that test positive and we should ensure the protection of their rights. that is an issue. but for 1 minute i would like to cite the other aspect of the test which does  receive as much discussion. those that test negative when in fact they may be positive there are those that test negative. are told they do  have aids when indeed they are positive. and so they may go out in the world. to infect further people with the supposed kledge that they are  infected when in fact they are. the fact is that there is period of time anywhere from 2 or 3 weeks to 3 months in the incubation of the virus and if the test takes place during that time. it can come out negative. when. the person is positive and clearly a risk.
i would agree entirely with all of the observations of the distinguished senator from massachusetts. he. along with a handful in this body. has been involved in aids issues as the threat has grown. the points that he is making are  philosophical points. they are  the points of a new englander or a democrat. they are derived from the advice of men and women of science whom he has listened to over the past several years. as. indeed. has this senator. i agree completely with all of his remarks. i might add. because i think it is significant. i have a letter in front of me that was written by dr. koop. the surgeon general. to dr. robert wilson. a new hampshire state representative. let me just read one paragraph. because it confirms those remarks the distinguished senator from massachusetts has made. the surgeon general writes: currently there are proposals in several states to provide mandatory testing for aids (e.g.. those applying for marriage licenses). while well intentioned. such laws would spend a lot of money testing a group for aids at low risk and finding few cases. exactly the point the senator from massachusetts was making: scarce public funds would be better spent providing aymous voluntary test sites for those who believe they may have been exposed. this method would uncover more cases. be more cost effective and lead to more behavioral changes. i am  opposed to strong laws. but rather favor laws and programs that will enhance public health and contain the aids epidemic. this letter from the surgeon general of the united states very well confirms what the senator from massachusetts said and what those that have been monitoring this disease k. let me also say that for those who think that testing is some simple device without expense. we are talking here about probably somewhere in the area of $105 million to $125 million. testing has to go with counseling. and that procedure costs about $42 to $50 per person. the dollar amount does  bother me. very frankly. as i said. whatever is needed we are going to go ahead and provide.
let me respond to the distinguished senator from missouri. the senator from missouri raises a good point insofar as how to gain more resources in this fight. i do  disagree. but i have to say to the distinguished senator from missouri that those who have opposed funding for basic biomedical research have opposed additional aids money and they are going to oppose $30 million so that people might live longer. a chance they might live. period. and they are often with those who say. "new taxes." it is usually the same group.
to my distinguished colleague. i would have to say. number one. it is  the only point made by the surgeon general.- the senator from massachusetts. or by me.  2. i have conceded that this is a fine point. to go ahead and raise the funds.
the main point that i made. and i will also read from the surgeon generals report. was that unfortunately the test is  totally conclusive. the surgeon general in this pamphlet "acquired immune deficiency syndrome." which i think should be in the home of every american. states that. "compulsory blood testing of individuals is  necessary. the procedure could be unmanageable and cost prohibitive. it can be expected that many who test negatively might actually be positive due to recent exposure of the aids virus and give a false sense of security to the individual and his or her sexual partners concerning necessary protective behavior. the prevention behavior described in this report. if adopted. will protect the american public* * *" the point i have tried to make about mandatory testing is that there are imperfections with the test medically and what is at risk here is  just a medical risk but a risk in terms of the individuals life.
again. i am a layman. all i can say is that i do  have a percentage or a figure to give you. what i am saying is that these are the opinions delivered both by the centers for disease control. the surgeon general. and the institutes of medicine.
the fact remains that there are two big problems here. the biggest problem to me is the person who tests negative. who goes out there with a false sense of security. the other problem is the person who tests positive and is . that can ruin a life as well as aids can take a life. i might add the report of the centers for disease control indicated that if indeed we pass this kind of mandatory testing law. then testing should be accompained with those laws that guarantee confidentiality and privacy.
the problem is that we do  k all the answers. you are going to have to make a judgment. as i had to make a judgment. when i stood on the floor last year and asked for $47 million to allow the clinical trials to proceed for aids drugs such as azt. i could look like a fool if azt had  proved effective. it still might  be effective. but it has brought some relief and it probably is a precursor to more efficacious drugs that will come on the market. what i am saying is that the same question marks will apply to you. you will  havethe certainty you are looking for any more than the doctors. scientists. and researchers have. this is probably one of the most complex problems that has ever been posted in the world. all i can tell you is there is apparently a lack of satisfaction by the scientific community that these tests are of a nature or are so guaranteed of result that we should impose them on lowrisk groups in a mandatory fashion. i am  pleading states rights. i am  pleading philosophy. i am saying that the best medical scientific advice that i have would indicate that they are  up to the task that is presented to them.
senator. i do  have the answers. the medical profession. the research people. do  have the answers. if we had the answers. there would be debate on this at all. but what we are confronted with is  specific. insofar as dollars for research and dollars for testing are concerned.
we are being asked to take a step which every aspect of the medical community advises against. for the following reasons: number one. you will drive those people away that should be tested and you are going to give false security to some who test negative but may well be positive. second. very franklyyou have  addressed the matter of privacy and civil rights for those who test positive. there is a whole range of reasons that obviously cause those that have greater kledge than i to say this is  the way to go. i might add. in the matter of the other part of the amendment that deals with immigrants. the public health service has made a recommendation there.  we have a conflict. the second part of the amendment addresses immigrants. the public health service has apparently made a recommendation to the administration that there be a screening of the more than 530.000 immigrants who seek permanent residence in the united states. the national academy of sciences and the institute of medicine. however. has stated: the u.s. government has recently proposed adding clinical aids to the list of "dangerous contagious diseases" for which aliens may be denied admission to the united states. this action ackledges the risk that such people may pose to sexual contacts and the burden that they may put on the u.s. health care system. it overlooks. however. the risk posed by the larger number of seropositive aliens without aids and. more important. the vastly larger number of u.s. citizens already infected with the virus. who are the most likely source of infection for others in the united states. if much effort goes into excluding infected people from the united states. it will waste resources that could otherwise go to more effective control measures. it may also result in other countries establishing restrictions on travel from the united states. so there is a dispute in this particular area. there is dispute on the matter of mandatory testing for those who are seeking marriage licenses.
absolutely. i am sure that those considerations very definitely went into the reports issued by the centers for disease control. the surgeon general. and the national academy of sciences. absolutely. indeed. as the senator well ks. for those groups at high risk there has been advocated. in some instances put into place. mandatory testing. there may be a value to it. ody is going to deny that.
which funds are to be used to assure that those who have been on a clinical trial. during the course of which trial they have received the medication free. can continue that lifeprolonging drug even though they themselves do  have the funds to pay for it. it includes  only azt but there could be other drugs which are as effective or maybe even more effective than azt. the fact is that during the clinical trial period for azt. burroughs wellcome co. gave the drug for the purposes of those trials. it was free. in any event. those that had aids did  pay for it. at the time the drug was approved for general use then the "free" stopped. if you will. and  somebody has to pay. some of those who have aids have thirdparty payers such as medicaid or private health insurance which will cover the cost of azt. but there is a large bodyaround 7.500that do  have the funds to pay to continue this lifeprolonging drug. they then would be the beneficiaries of these funds. again. azt is  going to save their lives forever. there is  any cure involved here but. rather. in the additional time allotted by the drugand it has been found to be lifeprolongingmaybe something better might come along to save them from death.
well. i am delighted to go ahead and have the question posed because it should have been posed 2 or 3 or 4 years ago so far as our national priorities are concerned. yes. the business of life is expensive.  as expensive as the business of death. there are  many questions posed around here on that multibilliondollar budget. it is expensive. let us get that right out front. and we have had to beg and borrow steala paltry sum of money every year on this budget debate for the national institutes of health basic research for cancer. for heart disease. for diabetes. i can go right on down the checklist. does the senator realize we pay $2.000 per person in this nation on health care costs. $2.000 health care costs per person. and we spent $25 on research per person. i would suggest that if we go ahead and get that turned around we can also get the matter of priorities turned around as to what is important. every day person after person says to each other in this nation. "you dont have anything if you dont have your health." that is  the way we translate it when it comes to the national budget. . let me give you a little figure. just so you understand what is involved here. again in the surgeon generals report: aids is a lifethreatening disease and a major public health issue. its impact on society is and will continue to be devastating. by the end of 1991. an estimated 270.000 cases of aids will have occurred with 179.000 deaths within the decade since the disease was first recognized. in the year 1991. an estimated 145.000 patients with aids will need health and supportive services at a total cost of between $8 billion and $16 billion. the senator is a member of the finance committee. this is his province. i would hope that if i do my job as a member of labor. health and human services appropriations committee -and the labor and human resources authorizing committee that maybe i can reduce what you are going to have to pick up down the line. but the only way i am going to reduce it is through the channels of science and research. and i need the money  just to go ahead and tend to the dying. what satisfaction do you think that gives me. that is the $30 million. that is the dying. i want the money for research and for life. believe me. i can get that out of this administration or this congress. so when you turn to me and say: "hey. this is going to be expensive." it is going to be expensive. it is going to be even more expensive if we do  turn our priorities around as to what is important in this nation. we are discussing catastrophic health insurance around here and i think that is very important. but i suggest that the figure of $25 per person for researchwe are far better spending money on research so that we do  get to the catastrophic costs.
wait a minute. what i have given to you in the way of figures is what i got from the national institutes of health and centers for disease control. if you will cite your source. maybe we can see a difference. i am  trying to mislead and i do  want to create a sense of panic. more than that sense of panic has already started. the numbers reported. as of may 11. in the united states: cases reported. 35.219. deaths. 20.352. number infected. 1.5 million. cases expected by 1991. 270.000. deaths by 1991. 179.000. i can go ahead and cite any other figures because they would be speculative by me.
my response comes in several parts. first of all. the technical side of it. roughly talking about 7.500 individuals who would  be covered by thirdparty payments. it would  make any difference to me whether it was one person. the problem is that i have to put myself in this persons shoes. never mind being a u.s. senator. i have a lifethreatening disease. i am a human being. i want to live. i want to live as long as possible. i want to have a chance at life. i can say to you that aids has been my special cause while i have been in the senate. because i have been out there pounding on the doors on behalf of every conceivable disease in this nation and for giving everybody a chance at life. but. yes. very frankly. if it is only one or two people. i am  going to say to them: " you cant have this. we dont have egh money. if you dont pay. you die." all i am saying to you is that i am doing the best i can for those who are infected and/or dying. i am giving them the greatest chance at life. very frankly. i recognize my obligations. and i do  even want it to come to your doorstep. where you have to pay $8 billion to $16 billion for medicaid. i am doing the best i can at the other end of the spectrum so far as research is concernedbasic research and aids research. what should bother you. for example. is that the president of the united states annced to the public that we are going to have $100 million for aids research and everybody says how great that is. while he is cutting the basic research of nih by $649 mil. lion. this is the same president who would go ahead and gut basic research. i am saying. in terms of aids or any other disease in this nation. yes. life comes probably even more expensive than death. we hand out the money for death willynilly around here. with here the debate and discussion you and i are having.
if that is going to be the essence of this debate. you may have senator helms staff. i will take the centers for disease control and the national institutes of health and the surgeon general of the united states. i have tried to give you the figures. i might add. do we all think there might be more out there. we might. but as we proceed down this road and this debate. i think it is absolutely necessary that we stick to science. otherwise. the situation is going to get out of control. mally. an amendment like this would  bother me too much. but it is going to set the pace for the debate on aids. i am going to do the best i can to make sure that what is happening in the administration. in the oval office. is  going to happen on the senate floor. i am  going to get into a debate between philosophers and scientists. this is a matter of science.
that is my opinion. obviously there are others that feel there ought to be a limitation. and that is fair egh. forget we are talking about aids. let us say that there is a promising development in cancer and it is imminent and i have a chance to live and probably will be the beneficiary of the new development. do i want my government to spend a few dollars on that. god ks. we spend egh as i said on the business of death. how about life and the chance at it. so to me this is  an aids argument. i get back to the point i made earlier in the debate. i feel in all areas of research. in all areas of science. we ought to spend a great deal of money. a great deal more than we ever conceived of. the national academy of sciences has recommended $1 billion in education and $1 billion more in research between  and 1990. that is a big chunk of dough. should we go ahead and spend it. this is aids we are talking about . i say yes we should spend it. indeed. i repeat to the senator i would far rather have the money in research and have a product which cures aids than to have to spend money on prolonging life. but at least what i think i ought to do while that is going on. since the research effort on the vaccine and appropriate chemoprophylactic drugs is going on. at least i ought to give that person who is dying  the chance of being the beneficiary of such a discovery.
first of all. let me say that since i think it necessary to get my figures from sources which have the kledge i ask staff to once again contact cdc and the low side of these who are infected is 1.5 to 2 million and that comes from the centers for disease control. 1.5 to 2 million. if a staff member has better figures. fine. the senator may use them. but i am trying to give him facts. and i can do that when i give it to him and then i find it contested by some lay person who comes roaring out of the republican cloakroom. that to me is  a debate as it should take place on this issue. on the matters of cost and dollars. i tried to indicate to the senator exactly what the dollars are. i have tried to indicate to him we do get into the area of opinionthat we need to do whatever is necessary to prolong life. to save life. i do  k the overall tab. i can only tell him what the tab is both in the bill and the bill coming up in the 1988 appropriations bill. but. the senator is correct. he is absolutely correct when he says we are dealing with a problem of emous proportions. it is the biggest problem this place will ever deal with.
this is the type of argument i am going to kk down when i see it on the floor. whether a good friend philosophically of mine like the senator. or my friend from th carolina. who i oppose on just about every issue. i already indicated to the senator that the $10.000 figure is accurate right  but that probably is going to decline precipitously within a short matter of time. to go ahead and use that in light of the facts i have given the senator i think in some ways is to overegg the pudding a little bit on the cost side. i think the point that the senator wants to make which would be entirely valid is this is going to be an expensive proposition. yes. it certainly is going to be an expensive proposition. just think of the medicare figures that i have already cited to the body. $16 billion. that is the high side of koops estimate. by 1991. the senator is on the finance committee. has he prepared for that one. we talk about balancing the budget. is he prepared for $16 billion in additional medicaid costs. it is expensive. then. again. i have to repeat i would seek this money for a lot of other illnesses and have and will continue to do so. but i think that what i do have to say is that i will only try to come before the senator and this body with dollar amounts and with scientific analysis that is  of my conjecture or my staffs conjecture. but rather emanates from the office of the surgeon general and centers for disease control and national academy of sciences and others who are qualified to opine.
well. that is one of the problems the distinguished senator raises which is a valid point. as the distinguished senator ks. the public health service has recommended mandatory aids testing for the 530.000 immigrants seeking permanent residence. and that  goes to secretary of health bowen and to the office of management and budget. to the white house. for their approval. it raises a whole other problem. and. i might add. on the amnesty program. that again has to be addressed. one of the points i am suggesting to the senate and also to the individual. the senator from th carolina. who proposes the amendment is.  1. on the immigration question. that is in the mill from the public health service to dr. bowen to be resolved by them. and this amendment here. in effect. changes the immigration laws on a supplemental and that is  the way to go ahead and handle it. so. again. to get the proper response. both as to those seeking permanent residence and those that come under the new immigration laws which were so carefully crafted by the distinguished senator from wyoming. these matters require far more thought than an amendment to the supplemental. appropriation bill and. i might add. far more action.
. i am  going to rehash the arguments. i think they were effectively presented by the distinguished senator from th carolina. i tried to present the other point of view on this matter. specifically that every medical authority of government has advocated against mandatory testing for marriage license. i made the point that the test as we  k it is  always accurate. that in going ahead and conducting it. very frankly. we could have people wandering around with a false sense of security and infecting others. i made the point that this amendment changes the immigration laws of the united states. i made the point that the cost of this. in both instances. is probably a half a billion dollars. which we are attaching with the amendment of the senator from th carolina. i am  going to rehash all of that. because i think we have tried to address it. the point that i agree on with the distinguished senator from th carolina is that he should have an up or down vote on his amendment and there ought to be an up or down vote on whether or  we are going to appropriate these moneys to enable those that are presently dying from aids to have a chance at life. . i pleaded with the distinguished senator from missouri  to phrase the question that way to the senate. we ought to stand up and get counted on both issues. and. for his own reasonsand i am sure they are good oneshe decided it was far better to go the pointoforder route. i am  disputing that. but what i am saying to you is that i am  willing to have that happen. . i have appealed the ruling of the chair. we have the yeas and nays. maybe there is some way that we can get votes so that people can vote up or down on these matters. which are quite pertinent to the crisis facing the nation. but. again. i agree with the distinguished senator from th carolina. we are  going to tiptoe into recess without at least assuringeven if we do  have it todaywithout assuring that we are going to have up or down votes. that is what we are here for. how are we going to win this battle against aidswe might be coming at it from two different directions. but neither one of us is denying the magnitude of the diseaseif we tiptoe away from our responsibilities. what i would like to do is suggest the absence of a quorum so that the parties involved here might sit down in the quiet of some room to see exactly how we can get this particular thing to a point where we can vote up or down. because i can assure youand i think the senator from th carolina feels as i dowe are  going to sit here and vote on a point of order today or. if we are. we will do everything we can to bring it around to where we overrule the chair. and clearly there are matters here where the chair probably should be sustained. what i would like to do is to see whether or  a discussion can take place to resolve this.
again. i want to repeat. the senator from missouri is a dear friend of mine. but i am afraid there was confusion because of the debate between the two of us. after the debate was over i once again contacted the centers for disease control. one and a half million americans are affected. the may 18 statistics say there are 35.658 reported cases. one and a half million people in the united states are infected by the hiv virus.
 this is a onetime appropriation under the public health emergency fund for those individuals that received azt free on the clinical trials and are  unable to pay for it and for those who are medically eligible for azt but can afford to pay for it. that is what this provides for. you have roughly 7.500 people who do  receive thirdparty payments. many of whom will be medically eligible for azt.
again. this is an emergency. it comes from the public health emergency fund. that fund is authorized with $30 million. we are  creating a new program. it is authorized at $30 million. the funds cover those who are medically eligible but can afford to pay for the treatment. that is what the money is used for. for an existing program with an existing authorized amount. if this is  an emergency. i do  k what is. these people will die if they do  get the money.
. we owe each and every american access to essential health care. this legislation takes an important first step toward securing that access. without a commitment to adequate health care. this nation can go forward in science or business or education or any other sector of society through which our progress grows. i urge expeditious consideration of this critically needed legisla.tion.* by mr. evans (for himself. mr. murkowski. and mr. hecht):
 of the united states has indicated the regulations will be implemented. i do  k if the managers are on the floor or . but i would suggest. so that we can get on with the business of the senate. that we separate the two issues. let the matter of the $30 million stand by itself and let the matter of the hiv virus being placed on the list of dangerous contagious diseases stand by itself. in order to accomplish that. it would be necessary for this body  to raise the point of order on the matter of adding the hiv virus to the dangerous contagious diseases list. because indeed it is legislation on an appropriations bill. i would be willing to give my word that i would  raise such a point of order and. indeed. if anybody did. there would be agreement as to this matter. this way the distinguished senator from th carolina can make his point regarding those applying for permanent resident visas and the matter of adding the hiv virus to the dangerous contagious diseases list. i would point out that at the present time there are those who could very well  afford the lifeprolonging drug azt. they should  be put in the position. in effect. of dying for a lack of funds when the $30 million from the public health emergency fund would be available to them to continue their treatment.
. a parliamentary inquiry. it is my understanding that the committee amendment embodying the $30 million in the public health emergency funding. which was an excepted amendment. has been agreed to and that there is further action needed on that committee amendment.
 for those statements. but then comes. the next sentence. final judgment is up to god. of what other disease do we say this. are we indeed in this nation going to judge people on how they die or are we going to judge them on how they live. the distinguished senator from texas said we are dealing with a communicable disease problem.  a social problem. i agree completely and have agreed for years. why is it that we should assess blame as far as this particular disease is concerned. do we assess blame on those who die from cancer from smoking or cirrhosis of the liver from drinking. in this nation. when you hurt. we take care of you. if you are dying. we want you to live. we do  start making moral judgments or saying the judgment is up to god. the only judgment that we are concerned with on this floor is that which can bring relief to pain and from death. and that is something we have within our power with dollars going to science. amount of rhetoric. amendments that put the focus on immigrants. can get away from that final responsibility. whether it is the education of our children. which should be explicit. or whether it is the money that goes to research. one thing is -for sure: the present state of the art is such that if you have aids. you die. over and out. there is point in coming along later and saying. "i should have told my child more. you better tell them the whole story  as early as possible there is also point in coming along late and saying. "i wish we had invested more money in research." we invest it . whether it is a sacrifice of our sensibilities or a sacrifice of our money. this is really what it comes down to. and this body will be called upon time and again to supply the wherewithal to accomplish both of these things. i will vote for the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina.  because it is the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina. but because it is a recommendation of the public health service. and that is the last point i want to leave with my colleagues. if the driving force comes from science behind whatever we do. we will be all right. if it is a matter of politics or philosophy. we will do very wrong and the price will be very. very high for our error. i urge that we support this particular amendment. advising my. colleagues that the next matters they will be voting on will. have very large dollar signs :attached to therm that will be a tougher vote than the one they. will  dispense with. i thank the chair. - :
. i rise today with my colleague from rhode island. senator chafee. to introduce the medicaid home and community quality services act of 1987. this legislation will restructure the current system of funding medicaid services for people with severe disabilities- in order to increase their independence. productivity. and integration into the community. further. it will replace the current fragmented leadership on disability issues within the federal medicaid bureaucracy with a centralized unit that will oversee medicaid disability policy and ensure the delivery of highquality services. as lawmakers. it is our responsibility to enact legislation consistent with the constitutional principle of providing for the general welfare. we have adapted this principle to changing perceptions of disabled individuals. we have made mistakes. we have learned from them. and we have moved on to new responses. with disabled americans themselves  in the leadership of this movement. only during the last 20 years or so have we truly begun to break down the barriers that placed opportunity for disabled individuals in a class below opportunity for all americans. disabilities are  selective about the families they touch. we are all potential candidates. but how we support individuals with disabilities is  just an issue for families. it is an ecoic and a humanitarian issue that touches the essence of what we stand for as a nation. today. we can be proud that many laws. such as the education of the handicapped act. the rehabilitation act. and the developmental disabilities act. reflect the current state of our kledge about the abilities of people with disabilities. these individuals have shown us that almost anything is possible. with the right support. yet despite over $3 billion commitment to carrying out these visionary laws. we are still spending nearly the same amount of federal funds to support an antiquated system of services for the disabled through medicaid. indeed. the medicaid program is the largest financial aid program for people with disabilities. with most of the funding going to the "intermedicate care facility for the mentally retarded" [icf/mr] program. in 1986 the amount expended by the federal government and the states for this program was estimated at over $5 billion. and still rising. for the most part. the money is used to fund large. public institutions. which at best offer limited opportunities and custodial care. and at worst promote segregation from families and society. encourage dependence. and allow the abuse and neglect of those very individuals for whom the system was created. when congress created the icf/mr program to fund services for disabled people 16 years ago. it assumed that federal medicaid dollars would be directly linked with quality services. at the same time. however. the program was structured in a biased manner. with funding going primarily to state institutions and few dollars directed toward keeping people with disabilities in their homes and communities. this system has turned out to be very costly. average costs vary between states. but one estimate for 1985 says more than $32.000 was spent per year per person. recent statistics from my own state of connecticut indicate an annual cost of approximately $73.000 per person per year. yet we k that these institutionbound funds do  necessarily buy quality services. in fact. the results of hearings on conditions in institutions. conducted last session by the subcommittee on the handicapped. indicated just the opposite. these hearings. and the investigation which preceded them. found that the programs funded with medicaid dollars often provide inadequate services and protections to people confined within institutional walls. while medicaid enforcement efforts have been stepped up since that time. and some improvements made. serious deficiencies continue to exist in many federally supported institutions. and it is shameful that today. such conditions as were unveiled during those hearings continue. and are financed with federal funds. this situation is particularly disturbing given our recognition that people with disabilities need  be bound to a barren life of inactivity and segregation. indeed we  k that very often these same individuals confined to institutions could be living in the community. where they could have meaningful work and experience the daytoday joys and sorrows of life among family and friends. but the existing medicaid system of financing services to people with disabilities inhibits and frustrates the development of needed community supports. yet the need for such communitybased assistance is greater than ever. twelve years ago. congress enacted public law 94142. which marked the beginning of the end of an era of segregation and discrimination against children with disabilities in our public schools. most of these students have been raised in the mainstream of life. they want to stay there. and their families want them there. but. as i was reminded at one of our handicapped subcommittee hearings. too often these students find themselves at the end of their schooling "all dressed up with place to go." we can truly realize the promise of integration which is at the heart of public law 94142. until disabled person is forced to abandon their bright hopes for the future because there are alternatives. people with severe disabilities in our country deserve full access to quality services that are least restictive in terms of their personal freedom and most effective in terms of providing personal opportunity. and i believe that the changes- in the current system of medicaid funding for people with disabilities which we propose today are critical in assuring this will happen. specifically. the bill requires that every state participating in the institutional aspect of the medicaid program also develop an array of quality community services and supports. it will allow for choice among the various available services. and choice among a variety of living situations. most of us take the choices we have in our lives for granted. but for many people with disabilities and their families. there have been choiceseven when that choice could result in less cost to the federal government. and what of the institutions. the bill we introduce today has  forgotten them. it contains numerous provisions to increase the quality of their services by strengthening the leadership. guidance and support at the federal level. and through increased training of those whose job is to review the quality of services they provide. but the bill sends a clear message that the future for people with disabilities is  segregation from the mainstream of life. because it is outside the locked doors of the institution that the land of opportunity lies. with the passage of this bill. those doorsand otherswill open. it will require the dedicated efforts of everyone: families. service providers. politicians. and disabled individuals themselves. but that opportunity will  be denied. finally. i would like to extend my special thanks to senator chafee for his leadership in developing this legislation. he has been a tireless advocate for the development of family and community services for people with disabilities. i look forward to working with him. and other members of the finance committee. as work on this legislation proceeds.
in response to the senator from georgia. i would like to have a rollcall vote on it. we are getting a little close even on the 25 minutes to a side and that would be without any further discussion of the pending amendment. i think there might be a few minutes still allocated to the pending amendment. however. i am prepared to move forward on my other amendment to transfer defense money to the national institutes of health. that would mean. if we started on the national institutes of health amendment at 5 oclock. according to the time agreement which i have proposed. we should be ready to vote at 10 minutes to 6 or quarter to 6. i have problem with that. if you want to start on that amendment and dispose of itand i would want a rollcall votei am perfectly prepared to start talking to that amendment at 5 oclock.
. i cause nih is emously important to have to remind my colleague from the health of our country. and includnew mexico that he made a statement ed in the benefits of the work of nih of $321 million that would apply to is the department of defense. the general health. much of which was our problem is that it is my undercontracted through nih. those are standingi do  have the figures  my words. those are the senators that dod sits down each year words. obviously he has the figures to and contracts with nih on things that back it up. i do  k. are of great interest to the dod that
i am certainly  our big problem is that we have an aware of what portion of the $321 mil- account here that is a very broad aclion is contracted out. the senator in- count and i am afraid what is going to dicated a large portion of it is. i am happen is you are going to be taking  in a position to dispute that. i medical research out of dod and putwould doubt a very large portion of it ting it into nih. i k the senators is. amendment does  specifically get indeed. i would say it goes around that detailed. but i think the net the other way. where nih itself. result is we are going to be taking the trying to ascertain certain facts. goes department of defense health reahead and funds activities at various search for their own problems. within military installations. the militaryways to treat wounds. this whole situation. as i said new methods of helping battlefield vicbefore. is  one of trying to attach tims. all of those thingswe are going military funds to affairs that are to be taking money out of that and beyond the necessity of the military. i putting it into nih. have tried to clearly establish a both are worthy causes. but that is common ground of health between the what a budget process is all about. military and our national health that is what the administration is effort. . supposed to do when they put togeth-
. i would respond to both of my friends from new mexico and georgia by citing a specific example as best as i can ascertain from your budget. on aids research. i see where in 1986 the actual dollars spent was about $33 million. a -later estimate. as best again i can determine from your own document. is about $21 of $22 million spent on aids research. this is a subject that we share in common between the military and the civilian.- the fiscal year 1988 budget had the administration advocating about a $100 million increase in aids research while cutting the basic research budget of nih $600 million. anybody who ks their science ks that we are as far along as we are against aids because of basic research. to go ahead and say you are increasing aids research while you cut basic research. in effect. results in a $500 million reduction in research activities on aids. the amount .that the military is contributing here is peanuts. if these figures are true. it is around .$20 million. i think we would also agree that this is one of the problems that has confronted the military. indeed. some of the best facts we have relative to the aids virus and. epidemic early on came from the military. it did good testing and reporting work in that area. the fact is we .are - yet stopping the disease. i would again only suggest to the managers of the bill that i understand what they are afraid of. i am  trying to take funds from sdi to go ahead and put into nih. i am just trying to go ahead and focus your own r&d money where it will do the most good. saying you ought to pick up your fair share of the medical tab with your medical funds. that is the only thing that -i have done here. let me also make the comment that i happen to k both the distinguished senator from georgia and the distinguished senator from new mexico are both very .sensitive to the health needs of the nation..it is their duty. certainly. to keep things -as best as possible as they -are within their authorization bill. but having been alerted to this problem. i would suggest that the matter has been :so improved to the point where movement is necessary. i would hope that the military would assist  just in the battle against foreign -enemies but in the battle against diseases when its own personnel are very much :subject to the exigencies of diseases. as indeed we all are. i would hope the amendment would be adopted
. the distinguished senator from .alaska makes all the arguments that i could ask for on behalf of this amendment. what i am asking is  that the money be taken from defense but that defense pay its fair share of the bill. very frankly. the -vaccine development and the principal research effort is  going on in the military. the senator is absolutely correct. they have done a grand job of gathering statistics. but as far as finding the vaccine or chemotherapy to halt aids. -. that sits over in nih. the senator dramatizes the fact that there is 5 times the rate of aids within the military. which makes the exact argument i am trying to make: who is going to pay the bill to go ahead and do something about it. again. this is money to go over to nih for the benefit of our armed forces personnel. it gives it to those who arebest equipped to do the job. which does  in any way denegrate the research efforts going on within the military. but i would suspect that a little help from our friends in the military would go a long way in shortening the time to which we will find a cure. certainly go a long way toward finding the chemotherapy which can halt the transmission or progression of the aids virus. - 
. first i thank the distinguished senator from georgia for his courtesy yesterday. and also my good friend. the senator from virginia. senator john warner. i do  k very frankly which is more trying. my kidney stones or his trying to give birth to this dod authorization bill. but whatever the case is he seems to be doing all right and fortunately i am back on my feet. i k how closely he worked with the doctors in the hospital yesterday and i deeply appreciate it.
. as i view the legislation that has been posed. i have to ask the question as to why the concern. i could  possibly tell you what the insurance law practiced in th carolina is. or oklahoma. or iowa. why the concern about the district of columbia. i do  think any of us here is prepared to give a full background on our kledge of why the insurance laws of the district of columbia are on the books. how they got there. the legislative history. the purpose. i do  think we are prepared to do that task. i have to say to myself. -well. the reason why it is the district is if anybody tried to do this in the state of connecticut. i can assure you we would be sitting here all day and all night. and the same would hold true for any of my colleagues. we all k as far as insurance laws are concerned we have left that up to each state. why this patronizing measure insofar as the district of columbia is concerned. is it the fact that they have senators here. i suspect it probably is. i am  going to involve myself with what the insurance laws are of oklahoma or th carolina. i do  have the time. i suspect the state legislatures do and they give a great deal of thought to it. i suspect that probably the council here in the district gave thought to what their particular circumstances were. i also suspect that the state of the kledge was rather imperfect when the legislation was drafted and passed in august of 1986. much has been learned since that time. so probably the legislation is imperfect both as to its drafting and as to its effect. and it is my understanding that based on these imperfections. even at this time. the government of the district of columbia is meeting with insurers and others to try to perfect the law. it is a long. involved process and i do  need to give any lectures to my colleagues on the floor about that. they k that process because we go through it every day here on the floor. i would suggest that a matter such at this be left in the hands of the legislative body of the district of columbia. indication has been given that there are some insurance companies that refused to write coverage. that is one of the impacts that legislation can have. so be it. when that happens. legislation is modified. it is corrected. it is brought up to date. that is what will happen here in the district. but i think to go ahead and pick out one particular governmental institution and one particular disease and try to legislate out here on the floor of the u.s. senate makes sense at all. then i have to ask a second question: why this particular disease. does anybody k the status of district law as it relates to typhoid or smallpox. dysentery. measles. i doubt it. why the problem here with aids. why do we focus on this particular disease and put it in a special category. what is the status of district laws when it comes to syphilis or gorhea. or one of those sexually transmitted diseases between people who are quote "straight". what is the status of the district law on that. are we prepared to answer that question.
this amendment is aher effort to focus on a tragedy in a negative way.. in a way that has never been the habit or custom of this nation when one is hurting or ill. never before until  has there been any other response to illness or hurt but that we want to help.  we have all sorts of judgments being passed. all sorts of inquisitiveness about what peoples statuses are" and what legislation they passed. who should be helped. and who should  be helped. whoever heard these questions arise in the pasts. why this particular disease. why this particular entity of government. the entity of government being attacked by this amendment can defend itself. it does  have two senators. believe me. we would have a filibuster on this floor if we tried to pass this amendment if it involved any other state of the union. if they were concerned.- but the district does  have senators. i will  filibuster this. it will go to an upordown vote. but one of the bases for that vote should be that were there representatives of the district. then they could inflict on us exactly what is being inflicted on them today by this particular amendment. i can understand that the distinguished senator from iowa. who i think responded very ably to the very well put question by the distinguished senator from oklahoma. did  have all the answers. we do  have all the answers. the legislative body of the district itself does  have all the answers. much of what we pass on the floor here we amend the next year and we amend the year after that based on experience. that is exactly what is happening here. at the present time discussion is going on between the insurance industry and the district. obviously the district of columbia does  want the insurance companies chased out of the district of columbia. what they wanted to do was to ensure that there would  be discrimination against a category of people at a time when many thought that that category of persons. miity groups. were especially vulnerable to the disease of aids. that is the fact of life. they wanted to make sure they were  going to be discriminated against. i think that is a proper legislative purpose. . as the tests have become more refined. as we understand the -at risk populations. then the legislation is going to have to be refined. and that the*district will learn through experience. itdoes  need the help of the .distinguished senators from th carolina. connecticut. oklahoma. or iowa. . i have been wrestling with the issues related to the aids crisis for a few years . long before some other people finally got caught up in it and i k only a few things:  1. an awful lot of people are hurt and dying out there who basically need money in terms of research to alleviate their hurts. that is the only way you are going to beat thismoney for research into the discovery of adequate chemotherapy to halt the progression and the shedding of the virus. and money which will go to ultimately discovering the vaccine that will eliminate the disease. i k there are an awful lot of young people we can prevent from getting aids as long as we put money into education to give them a very explicit education about what causes aids. these are the things that have to be done. i do  think we have the time to go searching around the corner to find out what the d.c. council did on aids. i k we do  have the money for that. i suggest that we would  tell other local. governments. never. mind the district of columbia what to do. why  tell new york what it should do. charlotte. nc. oklahoma city. ok. hartford. ct. let us really take this to where it belongs. our job is to do the job that is impossible of being accomplished either by the cities or the states. find the cure. do the education. provide the money because it is massively needed. here we sit wasting the time of the senate on just plain trivia. and trivia that is very hurtful. i wish all this time and effort were expended in these other areas which have suffered from the lack of money and a lack of interestand that comes all the way from the top to the bottom. i might add. as far as the government of the united states is concerned and i certainly hope that this amendment will be defeated on the terms that we do  k any more than that council knew. they probably k more than we do  since they have been consulting with the insurers and they have the experience. and if we are going to tell them what to do about aids in the district government. then maybe we ought to tell every other city council in the united states what to do about every disease. and if we consider it morally ok. we will  tell them. if we consider it morally bad. we will. i again repeat i think less judgment passed and more. help given is what is needed in this particular situation.
as i read the amendment. it says that withstanding the matter under the heading "centers for disease control." e of the funds made available under this act to the centers for disease control should be used to provide aids education. information. or prevention materials or activities that promote. encourage. or condone sexual activity outside a sexually moamous marriage. under the senators interpretation. would that prohibit any advice suggesting the use of condoms.
when we start talking using words that can have very broad interpretation such as condone. promote. i can see exactly what is going to happen. you are going to be limiting the dissemination of kledge. just as indeed with the other population referred to in the senators amendment. the intraves drug users. clearly under the amendment. methadone treatment or alternate treatments of drugs could  be suggested in any educational program by the cdc. so what i have tried  to focus on are two other populations. populations other than the homosexual population. and obviously this is going to be a lesson in morals to the drug user and to the youngster. and it seems to me that what i want to do is to make sure that this individual does  get aids or does  get gorhea or does  get syphilis. and i can do that if you are tying my hands behind me insofar as what can be disseminated. i would suggest to you if you have any confidence at all. maybe you can say i do  want lowell weicker going ahead and writing the educational pamphlet. or i do  wantlawton chiles. or you to pick anybody you want. but the centers for disease control and the national institutes of health are the medical experts in this nation. along with the surgeon general. it is the surgeon general. who i might add to my good friend from th carolina. was an eminent conservative. and a man who gets out there and tells it as it is from a scientific point of view and all of a sudden he gets in disrepute. i am just trying to say to the senator on the matter of kledge. that kledge. has to be transmitted. again. i might be able to work around this with the senator from th carolina were it  for the fact that if the kledge is  transmitted these people are going to be dead. dead. tell them everything and you better tell it  and hopefully if you do tell them. if you do tell them everything. the very matter which the senator from th carolina raises. that is. for example. ones behavior. will be corrected by the consequences that ensue. rather than any moralistic lecture. i think a scientific one is in order. so i just point out the two aspects of this would clearly. clearly restrict the centers for disease control in addressing the problem as among the heterosexual population. especially the young population. the centers for disease control would be limited from addressing the drug population. insofar as the homosexual population is concerned. i addressed my comments to that. but ody is advocating a particular course of behavior. but what you can deny is that among the homosexual population this is an emously highrisk group and what you do  want to do is to in any way deny them the information which prevents the spread of the disease within their community. so it is a matter of kledge  and what that kledge is to consist of. and that really is the essence of the debate here. i do  k what promotes the hesitancy or the nervousness on the part of the senator from th carolina as to what the centers for disease control will do but clearly it is important that we reach all these communities and reach them in the fastest possible time with the most accurate information. i might add. in terms of information. probably there is better educated community than the homosexual community. at this juncture. i worry somewhat less about that community. which has a network of information that probably will assist in halting the disease. as i do these other populations. our young people. and the drug users. and. yes. i do fear that anything short of total information means unnecessary lives lost.
i would hope that we would have the opportunity to sit down and discuss this matter before any votes take place because i think there might be some meeting ground. but again i am quoting from the latest publication of the u.s. department of education and the graph that they have on page 8. their source is the centers for disease control: "sexuallytransmitted disease cases reported 1985. distribution of persons with syphilis or gorhea. by age. "syphilis or gorhea. 25 percent. 10 to 19 years of age. 37 percent. 20 to 24 years of age. and 38 percent. 25 years of age and older." does anybody  believe that with statistics such as this on syphilis and gorhea that it is only a matter of time before this population is going to be confronting aids. that is why the word has got to get out and it has got to get out completely. what is at issue in the amendment. and i want to bring this to the attention of my colleaguesbut please understand there are three parts to this amendment. only one part deals with homosexuals. aher deals with drug users and the other deals with the heterosexual population. you are denying. by virtue of this amendment. full kledge to both of those populations. unfortunately. as has been alluded to by the senator from florida. there are certain matters that are more overwhelming than speeches by senators on this floor. one of them being sexual drives. regardless of what any senator says to this population. it is there. i suggest we address kledge to that drive in order that it be channeled in the right direction.  to keep it in igance. that will only compound the disease. again. what i have to repeat in the course of this debate is that one mistake and you are dead. we do  have a lot of time. indeed. we are already wasting time. right this minute that education should be going out to all corners of the united states and we are  doing it. the time has come to go ahead and make sure that we save the lives that we can save through education. and. yes. drug users have to k that until you do get cured. et cetera: there are alternatives. whether it is methadone. or clean needles. they must be told. because the problem with that october 14. 1987 cot1 drug user is. that he is  going to only take himself down but he is going to take his neighbors down. the problem with this amendment is it could be interpreted that if i suggest methadone or clean needles. i am encouraging drug use. i am . i am trying to get him off his habit and i am trying to save his neighbors. or if i suggest a condom to a young person. under this amendment. i am. therefore. advocating premarital. extramarital sex. i am . i am trying to save that youngster from contracting a sexual disease and probably aidsand taking his young classmates down with him. that is the i.ssue. i k most people. and i. as you k. have a great faith in what science can do. but for the time being. science does  have the answer. we are working toward it. the only answer is education and if you are going to censor that education you have solution. i urge. my colleagues that are  on the floor. but are listening. to understand what is here. this is a very emotional amendment. but understand you will deny that education to the highestrisk population. the homosexual community. but you will also deny it to the other highrisk population. drug users. our nations children. i can put it any better. yelling louder. as i am . will  make the point any better than. i hope. the logic that i put before the body. this is  advocating extramarital sex or homosexuality or drug use. it is telling the public exactly.  1. how one gets this disease and. if for some reason you can be overwhelmed by the speeches of the senator from th carolina. that there are other ways. my friend from th carolina is a very eloquent individual. certainly but might i suggest that we do have a quorum call in order that we might sit down and try to discuss language here. potential language changes because i can assure my colleagues that this amendment is of emous importance to the bill. i might add. we are on an appropriations bill. there is much else involved here. just as the distinguished senator from florida said. we have science. health. education. we have a great variety of subjects that are all folded into this bill that require our action and i do  want to delay any further than we have to. we are all going to k what we vote on before we vote on it. if i came marching up to this table and saw a little oneparagraph description of what this is all about. i would say. oh. my gosh. i do  want to touch this thing.with a 10foot pole. well. we had better touch it and touch it fast. because if we do . people are going to die. i would hope that we could go into a call for a quorum at this juncture and sit down with the senator from th carolina. and then have an opportunity to stop and discuss this
. this week in the washington post an article appeared relative to comments made by the surgeon general of the united states. dr. c. everett koop. let me take this opportunity to read them because they relate directly to the debate that exists on the floor at the present moment. the headline of the article is: koop asks doctors to back condom use-
. this morning when the distinguished senator form th carolina submitted his amendment. that amendment read as follows: withstanding the matter under the heading "centers for disease control". e of the funds made available under this act to the centers for disease control shall be used to provide aids education. information. or prevention materials and activities that promote. encourage. or condone sexual activity outside of sexually moamous marriage (including abstinence from homosexual activities... or the use of illegal intraves drugs. education. information. and prevention activities and materials paid for with funds appropriated under this act shall emphasize abstinence from sexual activity outside a sexually moamous marriage (including abstinence from homosexual sexual activities) and abstinence from the use of illegal intraves drugs. and it went on from there. what has occurred during the course of discussions with the distinguished senator from th carolina is basically the intraves drug user has been eliminated from the language of the amendment that prohibits such activity. as is the reference to the heterosexual community which prohibits certain activities. those have been taken out of the amendment along with the word "condone." so we  have before us the language that in effect says "e of the funds made available under this act". et cetera. "shall be used to provide educational. informational. or preventative materials or activities that encourage. or promote" directly or indirectly homosexual sexual activities. it certainly. as i said before. is  the object of the centers for disease control to go ahead and encourage any particular lifestyle. it is their job to aid in fighting this disease with all the education that we have available to us. and getting that education to all of our citizens. even though this compromise has been fashioned. i still think that its implications are such that it would be very difficult for this senator to vote for it. it implies that the centers for disease control are doing somewhat less than their job. and believe me. they are one of the few institutions in this country that are doing their job. and doing it well. i understand there are going to* be further aids amendments. and we -will address those as they come up. but i suppose what it all amounts to on the bottom line is. that the fight against aids should be waged in terms of micromanagement by the centers for disease control and the national institutes of health and the doctor. physicians. and nurses around this nation. and  by politicians. again. i have to point out that this is the first time. to my memory anyway. that we have heaped a moral judgment on a certain part of our population. for those who are all sitting there an saying. "i dont like homosexuality." just remember this: if you drink. we might just heap our moral judgment on you someday. if you engage in a little straight sex that results in the expenditure of federal funds. for example. and creates syphilis and gorhea. we might heap our moral judgment on you someday. if you smoke and get cancer of the lung. we may heap our moral judgment on you someday. once you start this game. there is end to it. i k my limitations on the floor of the u.s. senate. i k some may believe that lowell weicker feels he has limitations at all. but i understand my limitations on the floor of the u.s. senate. i have done the best i can with what is an unsatisfactory situation. matter how you frame it. and i agree to the compromise or i do  agree to it. but i realize these things have to be done. but i am  going to set the precedent of who is and who is  going to get my help. i have to live with myself. and all i can say as i go through my career here is that i am sure i will make a lot of mistakes. but i will never make the mistake of turning my back on- anyone who is sick. so let us get to a vote on this matter. i have tried to explain why i will vote " if it is up or down and "yes" if it is to table.
as i understand it. this is an amendment that has been cleared by the distinguished chairman of the committee. it provided $5 million in new appropriations for demonstration grants for the provision of health care services in the home. funds will be available after june 1. 1988. because of a delay in promulgating regulations in grant anncements. the authorization for this provision was approved by the senate as an amendment to h.r. 1471 as currently pending in conference. it requires a reduction in outlays of $1 million for the department of health and human services. department of education. and department of labor travel budgets.
. this requires the secretary of labor to issue a report by february 29. 1988. on the status of several mine safety and health administration regulatory proposals. the amendment allows congress to stay directly involved in the oversight of the mine safety and health administration.
. i suppose that i am saying to my colleagues. if they would give me the courtesy of listening for a minute or two. these kids that i am talking about. each one of you has many of them in your state. and you k the young families that have to pay for their care. they really do  amount to a hill of beans when it comes to politics. they do  vote. their families are probably too busy keeping matters together to even care about voting. but it seems to me that maybe the time has come to pay a little bit of attention for those that might  exercise any particular political benefit to any one of us but in our using our power on their behalf we live up to the finest ideals that this nation stands for. the matter came. i suppose. to national attention when the young son of nick boneconti. who lives in my state. was injured while playing football for tennessee. that young man has been in a hospital in miami. fl. slowly recovering from the injuries received in that game. he will be paralyzed to a large extent for life. it is easy for somebody like nick. who can afford to pay the bills. he has also the name recognition so he can use that on behalf of  only his own son. but on behalf of all young men and women who suffer from catastrophic illness. he can raise the money for it. i am as aware as anybody else. as i was told by the chairman. i might add. and i want to get to that in a minute. but i was told by many of the groups. "please dont present your amendment . this is our moment in time on the stage." i fully support catastrophic health insurance. i support it for the elderly. but i have to tell you. as far as the dollar and cents are concerned. the impact is far more devastating for some young child who suffers from that catastrophic illness and more particularly to the parents of that child and the family of that child. i think it important that the issue be raised at this time since we are talking about catastrophic illness. certainly the numbers are  there. the numbers are  there. those that i speak for are far less than those who will take advantage of the measures in this bill. which i. support. i support the bill. but i just find it amazing that we have money for everything or we think we do. whereas there are some very outstanding needs that we bypass in our consideration. i really have to ask the question. "why." i think maybe i come to the conclusion that we can bypass and there never will be any accounting for that neglect on our part. so in any event. i present the amendment. i hope it will be adopted by the senate.
i want to commend the distinguished chairman and the staff of the senate financecommittee for their diligent effortsn bringing this significant bill for senate consideration today. i- k senator .bnatrsaf feels as strongly as i that the wellbeing of our nation is contingent upon the wellbeing of all of our citizens. a childs injury or illness can be as debilitating for a family as that of a grandparent. while highcost medical care threatens the financial stability of someone on a fixed income. it is equally threatening to a young family with little time to accumulate savings. indeed. modern medicine has advanced to the point where a catastrophicallyill child who once faced the prospect of an early death can  expect to live well into adulthood. but while his progis has improved the financial costs have soared. and we have a basic responsibility for the integrity of the family and the needs of our children.
i was wondering as to the senators views since he has been. i might add. very active investigating the facts of the catastrophic illness as it applies to our children. and i wonder if he would respond to my remarks on that count.
i commend the distinguished chairman and the staff of the senate finance committee for their diligent efforts in bringing this significant bill for senate consideration today. i k senator benvsen. that you feel as strongly as i that the well being of our nation is contingent upon the health of all its citizens. a childs injury or illness can be as debilitating for a family as that of a grandparent. while high cost medical care threatens the financial stability of someone on a fixed income. it as equally threatens a young family with little time to accumulate savings. indeed. modern medicine has advanced to the point where a catastrophically ill child who once faced the prospect of an early death can  expect to live well into adulthood. but as progis has improved the financial costs have soared. we have a basic responsibility to the integrity of the family and the needs of our children.
i am pleased to hear about the committees intentions. as my good friend senator bentsen ks there is relatively little kn about the segment of our population that must cope with catastrophic childhood illness. to a large extent this is due to the multiple and diverse. insurance policiesand particularly the wide variance among state medicaid programs. therefore. i included a provision in h.r. 3058 the laborhhs appropriations bill for fiscal 1988 to provide funding for a 1year assessment of all families expending specified percentages of their adjusted gross income on outofpocket costs related to the medical care of their children. it is my hope that this information will currently define the number of american families actually confronted with financial catastrophie while caring for their ill children. and. until then itis really too difficult to project the costs of any program designed to assist them.
i commend senator bentsen and his staff on the design of the commission on children. it is comprehensive and contains an essential geographical outreach approach. our initiatives are complimentary and will serve as a broad survey of factors affecting very sick children and their families. therefore. i am withdrawing my amendment dealing with childrens catastrophic illness at this time and working with the finance committee in addressing the urgent need in the case of our nations catastrophically ill children. . i want to commend the distinguished senator and the staff on the matter of the commission on children. which i gather is  in the process of trying to ascertain exactly what the facts are. let me be very clear with my colleagues. the best guesstimate is the amendment as it is proposed will cost $2.8 billion. that is only a guesstimate. the distinguished. .senator from texas many. months.ago decided that we had to get a pretty sharp focus on the problem. therefore. he was the one that originated the idea of the commission on children. he is correct when he says that.  1. certainly we all feel the obligation. but we can act properly until we have the facts in hand. my own feeling is we ought to move ahead this evening. but i also stand on the realities of. the time. is it just this type of thing that you are waiting for before you move. in other words. i can understand  moving on this particular bill. but 1 am  coming back in this chamber in 1988 and hear that we are still looking for facts. and so forth. i see too many kids who have their whole lives ahead of them. and parents have to choose between giving them that life and giving them half a life or life at all. i do  think that is right. i will tell you where my priorities are: it is with the young people of the nation. that is what has distinguished our country. we live for our children. when we live for ourselves. the children are left in the rear. i hope we will work toward having facts from the commission. mr. bentsen.there is question about that. we will continue to develop the information. to try to assist in that regard. we have the general accounting office making a study also. and that should be available to us early in the forthcoming year.
i would suggest there are a lot of people who are opposed to the amendment before us today. including this senator. and including other senators on this floor. and including anybody who has a fair concept of what is involved in winning this war against aids. it is  just a homosexual lobbying group. i have doubt they have an interest in the matter. so would i. if my life and the livesof my friends and family were at risk. but i think what we are getting down to here is. does this body feel that it has the competence to wage and win this war by virtue of our own philosophies or our own kledge. limited as it is. in this most complex of areas. please understand. i speak  only to my colleagues.. but to those who watch these proceedings. the scientific community will tell you that indeed they are faced with the most complex problem of all time. are we going to sit here and potshot and try to go ahead and impose an uninformed will on the battle or the winning of the battle. we have been through this exercise. as i said. an amendment was passed and it is in conference and it is being debated. very frankly. it stands as a blot on the escutcheon of this body. but most important. i suppose we. could all take that. were it  for the fact that it is one more shackle around the feet of a nation that is.in the most desperate medical battle of all time. . are weall prepared to go ahead and make these decisions. is everybody. at the point where they can say. thatwhat is being proposed in -this amend-. ment. is of benefit in the winning of this -war. why is it...then. that it. has  been requested by one solitary competent medical body- in this nation. . .1 the senator from massachusetts alluded a fewminutes ago to what our -business truly is. i want to emphasize. that point because as recently as yesterday. the centers for disease control and the department of health and human services had a press conference indicating their plans to try and accurately estimate the number of people in the united states who are infected with -the aids virus. this is going to be a- massiveeffort and. it is
. i rise in support of legislation to reauthorize the national institutes of health. the medical research arm of the federal government. in 1987. nih celebrated its centennial year but the fact is that daily we celebrate its contributions to the health of our citizens and that of people throughout the world. nih supports biomedical and behavioral research in facilities in this country and abroad. conducts research in its own laboratories and trains promising young researchers for future work in the field. because it constantly gives us new insights into the processes underlying health. disease. and disability. nih is the best weapon huinanity has in the battle against the major killers and cripplers of our time. in recent years. congress has stood firm in the face of funding cuts and other proposals that would have disarmed and even dismantled this vital contributor to our national security.  it has an important opportunity to strengthen nihs ability to perform its mission by giving it new authority to deal with some of the more serious realities facing medical research today. for example. this legislation would enable the division of research resources to address the worsening problem of aging and obsolete facilities and instrumentation in nihsupported institutions. we have kn about this situation for years but done little about it. a survey of cancer research laboratories conducted by the national academy of sciences a full decade ago found that more than onethird of those facilities needed remodeling and almost onehalf needed more space.
s budget through granting increases in the overall health function severely impacted the following areas: health professions training. including geriatric training. childhood immunizations. and our community health centers. ody supports research more than this senator. indeed. e of the money i am requesting is to come out of the space station. i support senator garns request on that 100 percent. but when we talk about research it can just relate to space stations and to defense. somewhere along the line a similar commitment has to be made to human beings. it is one thing to say we have increased the funding for aids. and we have increased funding for the national institutes of health. all that is well and good. but how did you increase them. you increase them at a time of an overwhelming nursing shortage by cutting back on nurse training. you increase them at a time when we can give childhood immunizations to all of those who need them by cutting back on the childhood immunization program. you increase them at a time when we k that the over 84 population is going to double by the year 2u00. the over 65 population by the year 2020. by cutting back on geriatric training. out of 127 medical schools in the united states only 2 or 3 have departments of geriatrics. the geriatrics training program is designed to give the expertise necessary to handle the problem of training those in medical schools to be able to take care of the special health needs of older americans. you are also increasing some health programs at the same time you are cutting back on community health centers. this nation is near last among the 20 most industrialized. ecoically advanced nations in the world in infant mortality. there you have the four areas that got hit. and hit badly. my amendment does  come anywhere near restoring all that is necessary. but at least it makes a very clear statement on behalf of the elderly. on behalf of children. and behalf of the poor. their quality of lifeindeed. their lives todayis certainly of equal importance. and in this senators view. greater importance. than starting aher star wars type project. i repeat: the super collider is  eliminated by this amendment. the research funding and the planning funding stay in place. construction is postponed 1 year. when construction is going to take place anyway before the year is up. therefore. the amendment is budget neutral. but  so far as common sense and compassion are concerned. that speaks to those in our nation who need the support of their governmentkids. old folks. poor people. their lives today are as important as our kledge of the future
mr. piesidcnt. these will conclude my remarks on this amendment. and i hope my colleagues will consider it. i hope it will pass as a statement of what our priorities are in this nation. "if you have your health. you have everything." the old saying goes. we say it to each other as individuals a thousand times each day across the width and breadth of this country. but there is also a truth in aher statement which is less well kn. "the health of nations is the wealth of nations." by that measure. how wealthy is this most affluent of nations in which we live. in an enterprising article this week on the "black white health gap." the washington post put it like this: by almost every traditional measure of healthfron rising life expectancy to falling rates of infant mortality and fatal heart attackamericans are healthier  on average than a generation ago. on averagetheres the rub. as somebody once said. the trouble with an average is that you can drown in a lake with an average depth of two feet. that is the situation in a nutshell. too many poor and middleclass people in this country. black and white. are in over their heads because the health care they need is  available or affordable. and as a result. their health and wellbeing and that of their families and of this nation are at risk. they are also at risk if we do  have the institutions to impart kledge to those desirous of being in medicine. the price paid then. frankly. becomes death and disability. we must bolster.  undercut. our maternal and child health and nutrition programs. our immunization programs. our community health centers. and other health systems which bring kledge and trained medical people into the neighborhoods that need it most. there will be those who question whether we can afford it. but what we can afford is a country divided into poor and rich. sick and well. based on a persons color. age. or earning power. we hear a lot. and so we should. about how aids disproportionately affects the urban poor. but so do diabetes and heart disease and lung cancer. dr. william a. darity. professor of public health and dean of the school of health science at the university of massachusetts at amherst. describes the health status of black americans. in comparison with whites. as " much greater than it was during the period of slavery." we abolished slavery 126 years ago. but it will take more than an emancipation proclamation to right the wrongs where the health of america is concerned. it will take more money and a strengthened mission for our health programs. in some recent writing on the health care crisis. it has been suggested that perhaps technical techogy and expertise has outpaced our social and political mastery of health issues. the difference is that the politics of health is in the hands of the people and their elected representatives. we must take the advice of the medical and public health experts. but. as ben franklin said. in a democracy. th people rule. the question is: is the doctor in. it is  great credit to us that science is fighting among itself for the few pennies left to it. maybe it is that this will hasten the day when a budgetary process will be devised that can meet the instant and the longrange needs of the republic. but i am dealing with this budget. as i have to deal with those children today who will  be immunized or those elderly who will have care or those pregnant women who are imminent of delivering a child.
i thank my good friend. the distinguished majority leader. the senator from west virginia. i might add i am glad he is on the floor because a piece of legislation that came out of the committee of the distinguished senator from massachusetts. senator kennedy. on which he has worked very hard. and i have always assisted him in that regard. has yet to make its appearance on the floor. i am referring to s. 1220 which is commonly referred to as the aids bill. this is a bill to amend the public health service act to provide for a comprehensive program of education. information. risk reduction. training. prevention. treatment. care. and research concerning acquired immueficiency syndrome. it came to my attention yesterday from a member of my staff that apparently somebody expressed concern that i was in some regard responsible for s. 1220  getting called up for consideration by the full senate. i do have one amendment to s. 1220 that relates to providing aids education programs to our children in the schools but i want to assure the majority leader and my colleagues that i am perfectly willing to accept a 30minute time limitation equally divided on my amendment and then a vote. i hope. as a matter of fact. that those who are somewhat separate and apart from this senator as a matter of general aids philosophy would also accommodate the majority leader and miity leader and agree to time limitations on their amendments. to have a matter as overriding in its importance to the health of this nation as is aids languish really does justice to our task out here. i want to make it very clear that i hope this legislation will appear soon. that i am willing to abide by very small time limitations on the one amendment i have. or indeed if i have aher one time limitations on it. in order that we might do the job we are elected to do on behalf of those who desperately need our care and our assistance. i really think any further delay is a blot on the escutcheon of the united states and i do  think we are deserving of that.
i thank the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished miity leader because i do feel this is terribly important. as far as i am concerned. even though people might view aids somewhat differently. there is reason why we should  have upanddown votes around here. abide by those votes. and at least say we have done our job when it comes to the matter of public health. i am very optimistic. by virtue of the comments of the distinguished majority leader. that certainly at the latest by next week we might be debating the matter. voting on it. and in whatever form it takes move it on.
. the bill we are considering today can make a difference as to whether certain of our neighbors will live or die. in addition to expanding federal aids education programs. s. 1220 authorizes health care services. training of health professionals in the development of new treatment programs. it contains provisions to expedite the already recordbreaking pace of research under way to find cures and new treatments for aids. this body. i might add. should take particular satisfaction. if there is any satisfaction to be had in something as tragic as this. in the fact that it was the first institution of our democracy to recognize the urgency of research when appropriated $47 million to further the clinical trials of azt several years back. well. research has accelerated way beyond $47 million. but ody can ever view the senate and say we were asleep on watch when this threat was posed to the nation. but. however far weve come. more is required. this bill contains the types of provisions which are a comprehensive response to a crisis demanding our attention. demanding our resources. demanding our willingness to care about each other. one last point. the goodness of this nation has always evidenced itself when it came to peoples hurts by never asking how the hurt came to be. much of the pain and the suffering that has occurred during the history of this nation did  have glorious beginnings. but it never mattered. we all went to the side of our neighbors when needed. i do  think this is the time in our nations history to start asking why. it is very simply a time to recognize tragedy. suffering. tears. and pain.  finally. in terms of money. we are marshaling the resources of a great nation to go to the side of the dying. in this legislation we finally are setting policy. policy  based on philosophy. religious beliefs or partisanship. but policy encompassing compassion and kledge that one day will bring an end to tragedy. i think there is an assumption in this country. as to the preciousness of each human life. i do  ever want to see that assumption changed because. if it does. then our nation is changed. that would be the single most tragic death from aids
. i rise in opposition to the amendment. the amendment is exceedingly broad and in way relates specifically to the arguments made by the distinguished senator from th carolina. the amemdment says e of the funds provided under this act or amendment shall be used to provide hypodermic needles or syringes. can you imagine in the year 1988 telling our hospitals. our research centers. our health organizations that in the conquest of the disease. they can use lypodermic needles or syringes. this amendment does  say hypodermic needles or syrin3es as it relates to drug use. it just bans the funds being used for hypodermic needles or syringes. even though you are asking the national institutes of health to conduct a program of clinical trials. of developing vaccines and cures. e of the moneys can be used for hypodermic needles or syringes. even though you are asking the world health organization to combat the disease and conduct trials and engage in research in epidemiology. they can use hypodermic needles or syringes. even though there is a provision of the bill that says you are going to give home health care or health care in a community setting. the nurses and doctors can use hypodermic needles or syringes. that is exactly the way this amendinent is drawn. it is drawn to prohibit one of the main tools of medicine from being used in the fight against aids. maybe it is that people have feelings as to whether or  free needles should be provided to drug users. obviously. there is as much disagreement among the states and cities as there probably is within this body. but that has hing to do with this amendment. absolutely hing to do with it. it prohibits tile hospitals. the doctors. the nurses. and the research centers from using or having funds allocated to them for hypodermic needles and syringes. i am sure that we are going to have varicius intellectual battles out here during the course of this legislation. but this really does  require much thought by anybody in this body in terms of their up and down vote on this amendment. to say that hypodermic needles and syringes can be used in the treatment of aids or in trying to ascertain the cure for aids. we might as well pack up and go home. that is it. point in even having an aids bill. usually. as everyone ks. the senator from connecticut gets rather exercised in these matters. but i think the amendment speaks for itself in terms of the fact. logic. common sense. practice. medicine. science. you name it. res ipsa loquitur
. do you k what the result was of that 1 year. we could  even appoint an advisory committee. and why could we  appoint an advisory board. because an element of the biomedical ethics board insisted that a prolife criteria be applied to every single candidate for the advisory committee. i never asked the inees what their position on this issue was. but this group was bound and determined that ody was going to be accepted if they had a particular position on that matter. on that one matter. and so we could never function. and have  functioned through this day through the chairmanship of senator gore. i gather 2 years later we might finally act in appointing an advisory committee. just as 2 years later we are late dealing with aids the majority leader. the distinguished senator from west virginia. without losing my right to the floor subsequent to whatever it is that he intends to propose.
. this is  just a little statement of principle. this is one mans belief. and maybe that of a few others here. i respect the senator from colorado for it. he is far braver than i am. but as to making it policy by virtue of an amendment in a matter of minutes. to making it a policy of the government of the united states of americai am sorry about that. i think that we had better have a vote on the matter. i would hope that in voting people would understand that this does  reject that we should be thinking about these things or that we should be studying these things. but rather that such deliberations should go over a period of time and should be devoted solely to those questions.  as an ancillary matter the development aids policy in this nation. this is an outrageous amendment. it is  mischievous. it is outrageous.
it reads: since blood testing for aids became available in 1985. many infeci ed people have been immobilized by their terror. "it was regarded as a death sentence." says mark ryan. a 30yearold former disk jockey. "people assumed you could only sit and wait." wait to become sick. wait to die. for many months . the federal centers for disease control has estimated that as many as 1.5 million americans are infected. many of themperhaps nearly allwill eventually have aids. aids is invariably fatal. so medical science is in a race against time. without a preventive. without a cure. the toll of su. rering and death is likely to be very great. i think whe time has come to get to the busines&. hat we have here and pass it without the cheap politics i have seen exhibited on this floor this aftern. we should pass it without delay. in other words. for what might be considered more important legislation. what can be more important than 1.5 million people infected with the aids virus. many of whom are going to die. this is a disgrace. and this body ought to hang its head in shame on this last vote. i suggest we just stick to this business  and either do it or  do it ar.d go home and tell everybody what it is that we have  done on behalf of our fellow citizens. i will  agree to anything that interrupts the course of this legislation. if it goes down. so be it. if it can be passed. so be it. hopefully. we will come to our senses and pass it . (disturbance in the visitors galleries.)
i again ask the distinguished majority leader if we are trying to expedite a matter for the veterans. that i am sure is worthy of being expedited. maybe we can expedite the matter of aids legislation for those who are dying of aids. all i am saying is i would like to see the same effort put in behalf of those who are dying as we are putting in for the veterans. i get the distinct impression around here that we are going to end up with a veterans billeven though the majority leader assures me we will continue on the aids billor an aids bill that is  totally meaningless but is actually a dangerous piece of legislation before my colleagues are through politicizing it.
. i rise in support of the kennedy amendment. the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the prior amendment restricting educational material is  interpreted in a manner that would prevent the funding of educational material that is designed for the purpose of effectively communicating information on reducing the risk of hiv transmission simply because the content or presentation might offend some people or appear to promote sexual activity. obviously. you can inform people about prevention of sexually transmitted diseases without talking about the sexual activities that do or do  transmit the disease. the purpose of the prior amendment is to ensure that this is  done in an unnecessary or gratuitous fashion. but to the extent that sexually explicit discussion is necessary to communicate the message effectively to the target audience of people at risk. then the message is  promoting sexual activity. it is simply promoting health. thats what this amendment says and i urge its adoption.
. i rise today with senator harkin. the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on the handicapped. to introduce legislation to reauthorize the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act of 1986. this legislation was originally enacted in response to the appalling conditions in residential facilities for the mentally ill which were uncovered during a 6month senate investigation and 3 days of hearings before the subcommittee on the handicapped. during the course of those hearings. and insite visits to 31 facilities in 19 states. two facts became abundantly clear. first. mentally ill individuals living in those facilities were subject to abuse and neglect. second. those individuals often did  have access to adequate representation or advocacy to remedy the abuse and neglect that befell them. the systems that did exist to protect mentally ill persons were typically understaffed. overloaded with cases. and many times. were staffed by employees of the very entity that had permitted the abuse and neglect to occur. as the hearings that exposed this shocking situation came to a close. it had become painfully evident that. instead of being treated with dignity and respect. these individuals were being deprived of their most fundamental rights. clearly. action had to be taken to ensure the protection of the rights of these individuals. and allow them to receive treatment in an atmosphere free from abusive and neglectful conditions. shortly thereafter. i introduced s. 974. to create an independent. federally funded system of protection and advocary for mentally ill persons in each state. after 13 months of negotiations with the administration. service providers. consumers and advocates. this bill became law. with its enactment. a system was established to afford mentally ill persons assistance to help them secure their rights guaranteed under federal and state statutes and the u.s. constitution. it has  been 2 years since that legislation was signed into law. during which time this system has become operational in every state. preliminary data regarding the program indicate that protection and advocacy systems around the country have had an active year. serving a total of 9.758 clients last year through both individual protective actions and systems advocacy cases. unfortunately. the deplorable conditions uncovered during the investigation 3 years ago have  been eradicated despite the valiant efforts of the protection and advocacy systems. testimony presented this week to the subcommittee indicate that mentally ill persons continue to suffer injustice at the hands of a system that is supposed to help them. since congress first began its consideration of the protection and advocacy legislation. approximately $30 million in federal fands have been provided to establish and operate these programs. however. the fact remains that limited financial resources prevent protection and advocacy agencies from reaching a substantial number of individuals who require advocacy and assistance to secure their rights. some agencies. such as the office of protection and advocacy in my own state of connecticut. have been forced to limit their activities to one part of the state. again for lack of sufficient resources. many protection and advocacy agencies are simply unable to reach entire facilities which provide care and treatment to mentily ill individuals. clearly. when such an individual is being abused or neglected. he or she should be able to receive assistance under this legislation. therefore. in order to respond to the pressing need for additional resources. the reauthorization provides for substantial increases in funding levels. specifically. the bill provides for a 30percent annual growth in the program for each of the next 3 years. in addition. the bill includes refinements which will improve the ability of protection and advocacy systems to investigate abuse and neglect. and provide for enhanced involvement by consumers in establishing the priorities of the systems in their states. these refinements include a provision that permits protection and advocacy systems to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals who have either died. whose whereabouts are unkn. or who are in the process of being admitted to a hospital. additionally. the bill states that reports of abuse and neglect as well as discharge summaries prepared by the facility are considered records and thereby accessible to the protection and advocacy system. these clarifications will strengthen these systems ability to cexry out their legislative charge to pursue legal. administrative and other remedies to protect mentally ill individuals from abuse and neglect. the bill further states that the advisory councils. as renamed in the bill. will jointly develop program priorities with the governing board of the protection and advocacy system. although the final decision regarding priorities will remain with the governing board. this provision will assure that the advisory council will be an active player in the prioritysetting process. in addition. the legislation authorizes a study to be conducted by the general accounting office on the subject of abuse and neglect of mentally ill individuals in jails and prisons. this study will provide the subcommittee with important information prior to the next reauthorization on a number of issues. such as the extent of inappropriate placement of mentally ill individuals in jails and prisons. the extent to which such individuals are at risk of abuse and neglect. and information on model programs which are designed to divert mentally individuals into appropriate mental health programs. the reauthorization of this legislation reflects our continued conunitment to ensuring that individuals with mental illness enjoy the full protection of their constitutional and statutory rights. i am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and look forward to working with senator harkin and the other members of the subcommittee on the handicapped to expedite its passage.e by mr. cranston (by request):
will the distinguished senator withhold until i make my remarks. the only reason i mentioned it to the miity leader was that there might be some objection on the part of the majority leader. as a mntter of precedent. and i wanted to make sure he will have an opportunity to be heard. i should like to address my colleagues for 2 or 3 mintutes. we have had two matters presented to us for votes within the last hour that illustrate very well the complexities we enter as we try to be doctors and scientists and take on a role different from that of a u.s. senator. the fact is that the matter of spousal ification is extremely complex. it bas been a subject of discussion by the american medical association and many other public health and medical organizations. there is a bill pending in the labor and human resources committee which addresses this matter. but it also provides for very stringent safeguards of confidentiality and safeguards regarding the physicians role in this matter. to come along with a floor amendment and to ackircss a huge issue such as this in a few sentences does credit to this body or the legislation which we have before us. earlier we had the cranstonkennedy amendment. a pale version of the helms amendment. and i have to say to all. even though i voted for it. it really is just that. it was a pale version of tie helns amendment and effectively still ties the hands or potentially ties the hands of local and state authorities to provide the education necessary to avert the tragedies of aids or indeed any other sexually transmitted disease. i would hopl that we would stick to this appropriations bill which supplies the muchneeded funds for the various agencies of government that address science. health. education. and labor. this is  to say that we do  have a role to play insofar as legislation on these matters is concerned but it should be done in a fullfledged debate as a matter of various atthorization bills which will be before us. i am sure there will be more amendments co rather than to give vent to emotion on some highly complex subjects which will have a severe impact  just on those who are suffering from aids. but on their families and on tie medical policies of this nation. this is time for sloganeering or demagogery or whatever you want to call it. this requires very precise legislating. if any bill requires precise legislating. this one does. i understand political ramifications. we all do. but i think we just better stand up for the cause of science on these matters. i am sure that ody will suffer retribution at the polls come ember if that is the basis of their vote. in the meantime. if it is political. i do  think it will have any beneficial effect so far as votes are concerned. it will have a terribly damaging effect on science. on research arid on the people who are hurting. i just want to make those remarks in anticipation of what else lies alad i k that the distinguished senator from th dakota wishes recognition. i did  mean to preclude him. i have said what i have to say
. i think that clearly this is an intrusion. a very substantial intrusion into how local communities are  attempting to deal with their particular priority of health problems. it is  something to be mieromanaged from the floor of the u.s. senate. i am prepared at any suitable time to move to table the amendment
mr. prcsident. i ask the senator. is it his intention that in the competition for the grant under this section an existing center for pediatric rehabilitation research and training would be permitted to apply.
the senators point is well taken. i share his interest in expanding the counseling and voluntary testing program. but public health experts have told us that confidentiality and protection against discrimination are vital components of any voluntary testing and counseling program. i k the senator from illis is aware that authorizing legislation has been introduced in both the house and senate to provide these protections with expanded voluntary testing and counseling. the senator has been very supportive of those authorizations and i believe he appreciates the need for the provisions.
. i rise today to support s. 2393. the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals amendments act of 1988. this important legislation was unanimously reported from the committee on labor and human resources. and represents a bipartisan effort to both improve and clarify several provisions in the original 1986 law. three years ago the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act was developed following a 9month senate investigation into the frequently abusive and neglectful conditions existing in many residential facilities for the mentally ill. we learned during that investigation. and in the 3 days of hearings which followed. that there are many mentally ill people in our country without adequate help to ensure that their basic civil rights are protected. some of the horror stories we heard during that time were indeed shameful. while i see reason to reiterate them . i do want to say that it was abundantly clear that an independent advocacy system was needed in order to protect mentally ill individuals in residential facilities from the abuse and neglect to which they were often subjected. such a system was made possible through enactment of public law 99319. the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act of 1986. this act _stablshed in each state a protectio i and advocacy system. similar to tile system already in existence for developmentally disabled individuals. which would assist mentally ill individuals in residential facilities when conditions of abuse or neglect violated their basic civil rights as citizens of our great nation. i was proud to be the sponsor of that legislation. and am equally proud to be a cosponsor. with senator harkin and other members of the subcommittee on the handicapped. of the reauthorization bill we have before us today. the bill before us today includes amendments to clarify the scope of coverage. as well as clarifications of the roles of the governing boards and advisory councils. in addition. the bill directs the general accounting office to study the status of mentally ill individuals within the criminal justice system. finally. s. 2393 increases the authorization levels for this program. the inadequacy of current funding levels makes it impossible for existing systems to adquately meet the demand for their services. indeed. systems in some states have found it necessary to limit activities to one geographic area. or to one facility. today i want to focus my remarks on the provision in the bill which amends the definition of neglect to clarify that the failure to provide a safe environment includes the failure to maintain adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff. indeed. this a ugust 9. 1988 senator has long recognized that direct care staff in residential facilities are often faced with the difficult task of providing quality treatment under conditions which are far from optimal. problems faced by direct care staff were made abundantly clear during the 1985 hearings. one witness at that time eloquently described the effect of these problems on staff when he stated that direct care staff are expected to "have the wisdom of solomon. the patience of job. the caring of florence nightingaleall for the wages of a janitor." this witness went on to describe the effect of understaffing and inadequate training and supervision on the overall working environment. conditions which foster the likelihood that abusive and neglectful situations will occur. the efforts of even the most dedicated direct care staff to provide quality treatment continue to be frustrated by such conditions as inadequate staffing levels and inadequate staff training. which increase the likelihood that  only clients. but the direct care staff themselves. will suffer physical injury. information recently provided from a survey of seven protection and advocacy systems for the mentally ill indicates that in every state surveyed. the system was already looking at staffing and training issues. in some instances. such issues are routinely considered whenever the system investigates an allegation of abuse or neglect. the protection and advocacy activities authorized through this legislation. by considering such issues. will ultimately have a positive impact on the overall institutional environment. finally. i went to extend my thanks to the other members of the subcommittee for their work on this legislation. in particular. i wish to express my deep appreciation to senators harkin and hatch for their assistance on the clarifying amendment to the definition of neglect. and i urge the passage of this legislation.
these are americans who have been the beneficiary of federal funds appropriated over a year ago to ensure that those who needed azt would receive it even if they could  afford to pay for it. these funds expire on september 30. there are federal moneys to continue it. likewise. in many of the states. there are state or local moneys to continue it. indeed. there are other situations where the individual would have to spend down to the poverty level to make themselves medicaid eligible in order to pay for the drug. there are many ramifications to the problem. but the worst is that if the drug is  received. the person dies. i intend on this floor through some piece of legislation to introduce authorizing language to keep the present program going for an additional 6 months. i do  intend for this to be an entitlement program. but we are in position right  with a deadline facing us. being in the middle of an election year. to decide such an issue of life and death. we need 6 months breathing space. this will at least assure those individuals whose lives are being prolonged at the present time that during the recess they will  die. and that is  an overexaggeration. that is a simple statement of fact. . all i k is there are many here who are trying to fight a fire . and i really do  believe we can afford to get into a prolonged debate. a debate which can only lead to the deaths of an idinate number of our neighbors. i wanted to use the few minutes allotted to me for my opening statements.  on the conference report or the good work of the distinguished senator from florida. it is a good conference report and he did a good job. but i wanted to use my time to talk about the azt problem. it is mentioned in the conference report but i wanted to highlight it here again. we will have a chance to debate the authorizing language i intend to offer and all aspects of it. it should be debated but. most important. we should make a decision. later than september 30. if we pass the authorizing language. then we can fund the program in a continuing resolution or by administrative means in the department of health and human services. i alert my colleagues to the problem and the nation to the problem because. believe me. ody in good conscience gets out of this place until these 6.000 have been cared for. i thank the chair.
thank you. senator cmnes. as ranking miity member on the labor. health. and human services subcommittee of the senate committee on appropriations. and as one who. over the years. has fought to ensure adequate geriatric training and research funds i have a special interest in ensuring that sufficient levels of funding are provided for these two new centers for geriatric excellence. in fact. it was at my request that the centers were included in the senate passed bill. i assure my colleagues that i will carefully monitor the establishment of these centers by the national institute on aging.
 of the united states sending a letter threatening to veto a $139 billion bill that entails the quality of life for america because he does  want to see medicaidfunded abortions for women pregnant from rape or incest. for years  the white house has tried to cut all the funding for disease and for health research. for education and for students. and for the first time you are  hearing a word about that. so to the extent that this amendment is a lightning rod. it has taken the pressure off the needs of our society. what a commentary. i would hope the senate would stand firm. this is  the day before adjournment. we still have work to do. the work that has been accomplished in this legislation is excellent. it does address the quality of life in america in so many ways. but it is also time for the u.s. senate  to turn its back on those involved in the tragedy  lo bow down to those trying to impcse the tragedy. last. the reason that i was asked  to have this come to a vote was so that we could have "an agreement" between democrats and republicans during an election year that would  affect our political fortunes. since we have been unwilling to speak.and the house has been unwilling to speak in the face of what is overhwhelming opinion throughout the american population. then maybe the time has come for the american people to speak. to look at this record and to make those creating the record accountable so that when the next congress comes into session there will be a mandate on behalf of compassion. there will be a mandate on behalf of those who have been made to live in tragedy for years. there will be a mandate on behalf of common sense and decency
 is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation each year calling upon the people of the united states to commemorate the life and the service to his country and its citizens of the reverend doctor martin luther king. junior. and to observe that day with appropriate hos. ceremonies. and prayers. this proposal is  one i make lightly. but in the earnest conviction that we need to do all that we can to perpetuate the spirit and example of martin luther king. jr. it is already evident that he occupies a unique place in american history. the values he epitomized are the very values which this country needs to sustain it on the march toward a more humane and equitable society. i make this suggestion fully mindful of the fact that very few americans have been so hoed. negro american has yet been added to that small company of distinguished patriots who have received such tribute. at this time. more than any other. this nation needs to raise up for itself and its posterity the image of reconciliation encompassed in the person of martin luther king. approval of this resolution would be one measure of our commitment to do so. ho is  egh. but it is due. symbols are  the substance of action. but in the long and complex paths of social evolution. symbols are also necessary. dedication of a day each year to commemorate martin luther king. jr.. and his legacy to our nation would symbolize in fitting manner our reverence for the man and our devotion to his principles.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record resolutions memorializing congress to establish a new england regional drug abuse treatment center and pilot research center at the essex county. mass.. hospital.
. we all k how important it is that proper medical care be provided for all americans. the boston university school of medicine has long been a pioneer in this vital field. and it is with great pride that i e the dedication of a new facility. which occurred on may 10. 1969. i ask unanimous consent that the most appropriate remarks delivered on this occasion by dr. frank w. mckee. of the division of physician manpower. be printed in the record.
. what is the measure of a man. surely it is  to be found solely in his public positions or his private thoughts. in his travels. in his friends and supporters. in his good works or his involvement with his fellow men. in his accomplishments alone or in his goals. rather. it is found in all of these attributes combined. and in all of these charles goodell stands tall indeed. i have kn charlie goodell for many years. first as a thoughtful. careful congressman. eager to learn and open to all men and their ideas. but it has been since he came to the senate a little over a year ago that our friendship and our mutual concerns have grown and taken shape. we have worked together to impose greater congressional and public supervision on an often reluctant military. k and to pare back those programs whic is our studies led us to believe were unne l- essary. charlie goodell led the flgl u himself this year to prohibit opena .e testing and other irresponsible or que. a tionable methods of handling chemic .s and biological weapons. in this he we o eminently successful. and for this 1 .e deserves our countrys lasting gratitud in his public life. charlie goodei has consistently adhered to the philosc a phy that the nations ills are close] - interrelated. his commitment to indi e vidual issues and his dedication in th f pursuit of particular goals has  ob r scured his view that a multitude of area require our prompt and constructive at n tention. in this year alone. senato g goodell has introduced or cosponsore - legislation to improve the quality of ou air and water and thereby better th health of all americans. he has cospon s sored the manpower training act to pro . ide job training and employment t. - those who previously lacked the skill for a constructive role in our ecoy he has cosponsored an alcoholism car and control bill. a neighborhood healtl center proposal. and is soon to introduci legislation pertaining to the control an cure of drug addiction. senator goodell is concerned with th problems which puzzle all america: hom to alleviate racial tension. how to provide s adequate jobs and housing. how to im. prove the quality of our educational system. how to make our highways and oui airways safer and more efficient. he is anxious to improve the responsiveness and the flexibility of government. tc make it possible for all citizens to play a greater role in determining the laws and the precepts by which they are govered. within the senate itself he has sought committee reform and revision of senate procedures in order to speed the process by which legislation is considered and passed. senator goodells interests and travels. his statements and public policy recommendations. have ranged from asia to the middle east. from watts and harlem to south africa. from lake erie to the hudson and all the pollution problems in between. with his own commitments and energies. coupled with a concerned and competent staff. it may truly be said of charles goodell that he is a man for all men. he stands tall for his time. with the support of the people of new york. he and his state and his country may hope to grow taller still.
i thank my distinguished senior senator from massachusetts. i also wish to thank him for the fairness of his interrogation during the hearings before the committee on the judiciary. of which he is a member. certainly his incisive questions and the answers thereto were most helpful to me in my consideration of this inees qualifications for the supreme court. i wish to add that i am happy to see that the senator has recovered from his illness and is back in the senate chamber again
. again i thank the distinguished chairman of the foreign relations committee. he certainly raises a very important point in this discussion. i frankly do  feel that the american people. and certainly the people of the world. are cognizant of the devastation which either side can rain upon the world with present day capabilities. we are talking about the killing of millions of people. and it is )y means necessary that we fire off all of our weapons systems or that the other side fire off all of theirs. we could. even with a limited attack. kill millions of people. to say hing of the millions of the people who would be harmed by fallout and disease and all that would follow in the wake of such an occurrence. so. when we are talking about stopping this nuclear arms race which has been going on for so long a period of time. we are literally talking about the salvation of mankind on earth. i do  think this point has really gotten home to the american people. perhaps. they are somewhat confused as they read about  for his great interest and his understanding in conducting the hearings and giving us an opportunity to present our case and. as i said before. for reporting this resolution favorably to the floor.
. i was deeply distressed to learn yesterday of the breakdown in negotiations between the united states and japan on the question of a textile trade agreement. for many years. the quantity of inexpensive shoe and textile imports from japan. italy. spain. and many other nations. has been threatening the livelihood of american workers and the health of american industry. footwear and textile manufacturers employ 13 percent of the total u.s. manufacturing work force. in some states. however. the figure is as high as 57 percent of the work force. in massachusetts. it is 17 percent. yet in massachusetts alone. over 50 textile plants employing 500 or more workers have closed in the last 20 years. twentyseven of 221 footwvear manufacturing firms in new england closed in just the last year. so rapid has been the folding of manufacturing firms that an accurate estimate can be obtained of the number of workers who have lost their jobs. it is kn. however. that 2.4 million workers are feeling the threat as profits decline in industries across the country. and more and more firms are forced to close their doors. there is. of course. way to separate the direct influence of foreign imports from what might be called the natural attrition of older or less efficient concerns. but the fact that shoe imports  account for more than 25 percent of the total u.s. market. and that wool textile imports. for example. are up to 26 percent of our market. has a direct bearing on the health of our domestic industries. i have always been. by nature. a "free trader." i believe that the company or the nation which can produce quality goods at a reasonable price deserves the just rewards of its endeavors. but in this instance. my philosophical preference is balanced against a deep concern for the welfare of american citizens. some of the higher price of american goods is certainly attributable to inefficient and outmoded production techniques. and this problem should be corrected by the industries concerned. but a large share of the high cost of american products is also the result of higher wages. better working conditions. and an overall higher standard of living. our workers. and our manufacturers. should  be penalized for their achievements by being forced to compete unaided against lowpriced foreign goods made by lowpaid workers. particularly at a time when our ecoy is facing an unemployment rate as high as 5 percent or more. i believe that interim. emergency efforts must be made to keep our workers on the job. the orderly trade act. s. 3723. introduced by my colleague from new hampshire
. i am saddened to report to the senate the sudden and tragic death of a great civil rights leader. whitney m. young. jr.. executive director of the national urban league for the past 10 years. died earlier today of a heart attack in lagos. nigeria. he was attending the africanamerican dialogs. the third in an annual series of discussions among african and american political and civic leaders. whitney young proved that ecoic and social progress can result from intelligent.- aggressive and moderate leadership. he lived for only 49 years. but his life was dedicated to the betterment of the lives of others. and he died in the service of that goal. to his wife. margaret. and his two children. marcia. and lauren. i extend my deepest sympathy. their loss is also ours. and we share it with them.
i think that the senators proposed amendment is very sound. and has a socially valuable purpose. but i would just like to ask the senator a question pertaining to the phrase "engaging in the practice of medicine." for example. in boston. could a doctor have an office. say. in the back bay area of boston. which is one of the more affluent sections of the city. and then make calls into roxbury. which is a poor section of the city and classified as a ghetto. and thus qualify under the senators amendment.
i think it is most important that the intent of the senate be perfectly clear. as i understand the intent of the amendment. doctors would be required to actually practice medicine on a regular basis in a rural area or a ghetto area. it would  be sufficient for a doctor just to have an office and hang out a shingle in a doctor shortage area. or to practice in a hospital that might be located in a ghetto area. this would  qualify him under the law to be exempt from the draft. i wish we could establish some guidelines. through legislative history. that when the laws says "practice medicine in a ghetto or a rural area." that is exactly what we mean. a doctor would have to open up an office in the ghetto area or the rural area. and be regularly available to patients in that area. i commend the senator for offering this amendment. it is essential that we have more doctors in such areas. but if we enact this legislation and do  make it clear that an intent is to provide maximum medical service in those areas. we would risk circumventing the law rather than  achieving the intent of the distinguished senator from michigan.
. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in the record at this point together with a collection of articles discussing the health hazards that result from cigarette smoking.
. i am deeply concerned that the health insurance presently available to employees of the federal government does  include all members of their families who are dependent on them for support. as the law presently reads. an employee is entitled to include under a self and family plan only his spouse and unmarried children under 22 years of age. the cost of health care has been rising at an alarming rate in the past decade. running 65 percent above the consumer index. every person in this country has been forced to bear the burden of increased premiums and uncovered medical expenses or to go without needed medical care. at a time when hospitalization costs can quickly bankrupt a family. and doctors bills can severely affect a persons budget. every member of a family should be entitled to coverage under an adequate health plan. this is a concept this country endorsed when we voted to establish medicaid and medicare. yet this course is  presently available for employees of the federal government. particularly affected are the employees who have assumed the full burden of supporting a parent(s) but can include them in the family plan. i realize that this state of affairs is a source of grave concern. and that we are about to embark on a major debate on national health insurance proposals. however. where glaring and easily remedial discrepancies exist. i see reason why we should  provide the most complete coverage possible in the meantime. the measure which i propose seeks to deal with the problems of a federal employee who may be the sole. or principal. source of support for family members other than spouse and children. but who under present law can declare such dependents for health insurance purposes. in my own state for example. there is a civil service employee who is the sole source of support for her aging mother. in her own words: i am only a secretary making low pay. yet i am told by the blue cross office in boston. that i can ask for self and family protection to include my mother. other similar cases abound. of unselfish federal employees who support members of their families: fathers. mothers. aunts or uncles. nieces. nephews or cousins. they should  have to bear the additional burden of paying for extra medical coverage when their existing plan can and should be expanded to cover all dependents. i recognize that an administrative problem may arise in determining the question of dependency. a dependent is currently defined ex post facto by the internal revenue code as any one. 50 percent or more of whose support has been provided by the claimant in the course of the preceding year. yet is seems to me that a system should be worked out whereby the insurance carrier could process a claim by simply adding an additional section asking how much has been contributed to the support of the dependent as of the date of claim. the bill which i introduce today seeks to amend paragraph (5) to section 8901 of title 5. united states code. to expand the definition of "member of family" to include any dependent claimed under section 151(e) of the internal revenue code. i urge favorable consideration of this measure to ensure more equitable and complete health coverage for the employees of the federal government and their families. by mr. magnuson:
. this week is drug abuse prevention week. it has been designated as a reminder of the seriousness of the problem afflicting us and of the measures we must undertake to correct it. throughout our nations history we have enjoyed unprecedented successes and achievements. we have attained unsurpassed heights of social and techogical development. yet we are  in the clutches of an evil which has spread at an alarming rate through our social fabric in the guise of a remedy for mi ills. in the guise of relief. in reaching toward the zenith of industrial development. we have been negligent in our development of human response mechanisms. we simply do  k how to cope with the forces that have been unleashed. and where the complexities of our lives have too far exceeded our individual capacity to cope. we have turned to artificial means of escape. drug abuse prevention goes far beyond reducing the amount of illegal heroin coming into the country. granted. this is a vital mission and one which should be increased and intensified. our emphasis should  be on the white powder itselfit has always been with us in some formbut on the reasons why it is in such demand. what are we to do to lessen the demand for illegal drugs. what are we to do to lessen the demand for legal therapeutic drugs which are also being abused. how can the youngster. the teenager. the housewife. the businessman. and the scientist be reached so that each can face problems and stress without relying on a powdered substance to sustain him. this is a tremendous task. it involved hing less than a change of heart. a change of thought. a change of mind. the nation is up in arms. our people are crying out for help. government and private agencies are making every effort to provide aid and assistance. it is greatly encouraging that more support is being given for research into methods of reaching the addict or the potential addict. of developing the childs ability to grasp reality and its meaning. of directing his behavior in such a way that he can cope with it. many of our private as well as public institutions are beginning to recognize that society has gone beyond us. and that we must catch up and again control. this can and is being done with new techniques and new dedication. but . when our population is so deeply concerned with the problem of drugs. we must accept the challenge of eradicating the causes of drug use. we can cure the disease by simply treating its symptoms. that has never worked and will never work. we must fortify ourselves to understanding people and their real needs. we must eliminate the underlying causes: poverty. irrelevant education. poor housing and unemployment. to name but a few. only by focusing on the individual and his needs can we once again establish control over the system we have devised. i am. therefore. grateful that we have this week to reconsider what we are doing and where we are going. we have a tremendous challenge facing us. it is through new methods and new directions in every level of society that we will meet this challenge. we must each rededicate ourselves to this purpose. we must be willing to accept the new. to understand the concepts and methods necessary for survival in todays society. and to reshape our institutions. and our individual responses to insure a full and constructive life for all our people.
i am very pleased that my distinguished colleague has recommended and complimented our counsel rexroad and the staff. because these persons personally visited and saw the state of repair of the installations with which we are concerned. i am sure they were very helpful to all the members of the committee. sometimes when we see just a new line item. and it is said. "we need a new chapel or a new hospital or a new recreation area." it is well to have someone who visited there and who can say. "well. the chapel needs roof repair. but we do  need an entirely new chapel." or "we do  need a new runway. we can extend the old one." or to say. "this is  a priority item. it could be deferred for 4 or 6 years. particularly in these times." this has been very helpful to the committee in its deliberations and decisions. of course. we are encountering difficulties. in the manpower shortages. in trying to get persons who are needed to stoke the coal. and so forth. so considerably more than the $5.8 million is involved. if we are successful in our negotiations with the german government in having it assume full financial responsibility for these barracks. i certainly want to join with my colleague. as i am sure all of the members of the committee would. in saying how grateful we are to have the sort of expertise we have enjoyed on this measure.
. the american cancer society and the howard university cancer research center recently coordinated a breast cancer screening program for all women employees in the senate. i was particularly pleased to sponsor this meaningful effort and delighted that 640 women took advantage of this timely health opportunity. the significance of this breast cancer screening program is that 1 out of every 15 women will be afflicted with breast cancer this year and yet half of the female population ige annual breast examinations by their physicians. selfexamination is also quite limited with only 18 percent practicing this technique on a monthly basis. only recently have we come to realize the importance of preventive health care in this nation. rather than waiting for treatment when the disease is already present. each year millions of dollars are spent on medical discoveries and research. but too few dollars are earmarked for preventive educational endeavors such as this breast cancer screening program. despite the burdens upon their time. dr. jack e. white and dr. roy schneider of the howard university cancer research center coordinated a program in which a team of distinguished and prominent physicians volunteered their services to all female senate employees. the whole key to early detection as a means to substantially improve the cancer cure rate lies in periodic breast examinations by physicians. as well as personal monthly selfexaminations at home. for their concern. care and commitment to cancer prevention. i express my gratitude and sincere appreciation to the american cancer society. district of columbia division. and its volunteers. the howard university cancer research center. senator howard w. can. chairman of rules committee. dr. freeman h. cary. attending physician. robert f. moran. administrative assistant to attending physician. mary m. haislup. registered nurse. caryle connelly of my staff. and most especially to dr. jack e. white. dr. roy schneider. dr. burke syphax. dr. lasalle d. leffall. jr.. dr. william funderburk. dr. linda green. dr. edward cornwell. dr. paul carter. dr. william matory. dr. warren strudwick. dr. erman edgecombe and dr. charles clarke. this project has demonstrated that massive screening can be done within the senate system. effectively and efficiently. with possibly a sizable number of lives saved. i hope that this will serve to stimulate similar programs throughout the country.
given the broad goals that should be the focus of american policy that i have suggested here. what must occur immediately if the possibility of their achievement is to be enhanced. first. an immediate withdrawal of turkish forces deployed on cypru. isneeded to encourage those in greece and on cyprus who believe that accommodation is possible and desirable. this is especially the case in view of the overwhelming show of support for the moderate caramanlis government in the recent greek elections. the greek people exhibited wisdom in giving that government a clear vote of confidence in its attempts to pursue an enlightened belligerent course of action regarding cyprus. i believe that the present greek government is willing to support negotiations which seek to meet the just demands of all concerned parties. an immediate withdrawal of turkish forces from cyprus would be a strong indication that ankara is committed to a similar course of action. every effort must also be made to arrest the drift toward acceptance by many of the present demarcation lines as being permanent in nature. it is inconceivable that any just settlement can be reached if the turkish cypriots and their supporters insist on retaining life most productive 36 to 40 percent of the island under their control leven though they constitute only 18 percent of the population. an equitable sharing of land and resources in some form of rough proportion to population breakdown is crucial to any lasting settlement of the crisis. compounding the difficulties involved in the territoral aspect of the crisis is the fact that many greek cypriots were displaced and their homes and lands confiscated during the turkish military offensives. unless some form of equitable restitution is found for those so displaced. continued strife ratherthan violent accommodation will likely ensue in the future. finally. immediate and increased attention must be given to meeting the pressing needs of the refugees who face the prospect of a cold winter without adequate shelter. clothing. or food. the united states. in cooperation with others. must provide the temporary relief these people need over the next several months if the cyprus tragedy is  to deepen by several magnitudes. we can do so.  only by direct monetary contributions. but also by helping the thousands of concerned americans who have privately collected foodstuffs. clothing. and medical supplies for cyprus. i expect our government to do everything possible to facilitate the delivery of these goods. in conclusion. the time for intelligent decisions by all concerned parties is . failure to achieve significant progress in the areas i have outlined during the next several months will only make more difficult the task of relieving the suffering of the cypriot peoples and will greatly increase the danger that u.s. interests in the area will be permanently damaged.
. this bill would help remedy this inequitable situation by requiring that any 1975 increase in social security checks meant to keep them "inflationproof" would  be counted for medicaid eligibility. in proposing this disregard. i am following the precedent we established when the congress passed a 20percent social security increase. in public law 9366. we included a saving clause that continued medicaid eligibility for social security recipients who would otherwise lose their eligibility because of the 20 percent social security increase. my bill would simply extend that practice to any 1975 costofliving increase in social security payments. if the congress does  act to institute this disregard. many of the 3 to 4 million elderly poor who  are eligible for medicaid asistance will find that their next social security increase means a substantial loss of medical assistance. right . the average value of medicaid over the course of a year is more than $700. and. if any 1975 social security rise is  disregarded under medicaid. a $5 or $10 per month jump in social security checks will. for some. bring about a much larger loss of medicaid benefitsthereby actually reducing the ability of the elderly poor to pay their bills. the situation is all the more acute because of the fact that medical costs have been rising at a rate that is substantially higher than the general rate of inflation. moreover. aid in meeting medical costs is patricularly important to the elderly. and. relatively small social security incomes will  be able to absorb the tremendous new burden that a loss of medicaid benefits would impose on them. i can stand by and watch the good intentions with which we enacted automatic costofliving adjustments in social security payments thwarted by rules that require that some social security recipients lose their medicaid eligibility as a consequence. and. until such time as the congress works out a permanent solution to this recurring problem. i believe that the least we can do is make sure that the next costofliving increase in social security does  force some of the elderly poor off the medicaid program. by mr. brooke:
. i ask unanimous consent that a collection of summary figures on the health consequences of smoking compiled by the u.s. department of health. education. and welfare public health service in january 1974. be inserted in the record at this point.
. in all the eons and annals of this world nation has been as rich and powerful as ours. and yet our medical science could  save mauras life or the lives of ter- of millions who have suffered and died from the dread. omnipresent disease of cancer. and although we have done more than ever before. we must still do much more in using the great resources of our nation to find a cure for cancer. to tom. mauras devoted husband of 10 months. to her kind and courageous mother. to her loving brothers and family and scores of wonderful friends. my staff and i extend our deepest sympathy. we shall always remember with love. respect. and admiration. our maura.
. at the close of business on june 23 a very special person retired from the u.s. senate. his full name was f. clyde wilkinson. but he was kn to all who knew him as "wilkie." it is impossible to describe just how wonderful "wilkie" was as the official photographer for the senate republican conference. he was a man with a camera in his hand and a twinkle in his eye. he was a joy to work with. never letting his hectic daily pace interfere with his marvelously friendly disposition. he particularly loved children. and it was with particular enthusiasm that he photographed them. thousands of massachusetts children and children across the country have been caught by his camera. and caught with a smile on their faces. thanks to wilkie. i will miss "wilkie" and i k that my staff will miss him as well. he was thoroughly dedicated to. and professional about his work. and he was always cheerful and obliging in his manner. but even more importantly he had that delightful way of brightening up a gray day or lightening up our serious senate work. the thought of a senate without wilkie saddens me. but his retirement from this hectic institution is well deserved. i only hope that it is graced with good health and happiness for him and his dear and devoted wife. lois. a man who has brought so many smiles to so many faces deserves hing less.
as i understand. in some states there are many hospital beds that are empty. and in others. of course. hospitals are overcrowded. i was wondering if the senator had any data as to what impact his amendment would have on various states across the nation.
i take it. then. that the position of the senator is that any planning is the logical. if  even the central. forerunner of construction. and that it benefits health services and facilities as well as being ecoical to the federal government.
. i would like to bring to the attention of the senate the fine work of project hope. we should all be aware of the international and health benefits that hope provides. its treatment programs in the west indies and latin america care for the peoples of those countries. and. perhaps equally important. hope conducts a training program. so that these people will be able to learn to care for themselves. project hope is an example of constructive aid which promotes a better opinion of the united states abroad. it is the individuals involved who make project hope what it is today and i commend these dedicated people for their efforts. one such person is dr. george e. lewinnek of newtonville. mass.. an orthopedic surgeon who has joined the medical staff of project hope in kingston. jamaica. when i learned of dr. lewinneks position. i was reminded once again of project hopes vital role in the improvement of health standards throughout the world. in light of the contributions of hope and the individuals involved. i would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to an article summarizing their valuable work. i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record.
. the smokers in our country are the people who are going to require the benefits of this research. why should they  help support it. hopefully. the increased funding may promote a breakthrough that might otherwise  have happened. cigarette smoking is a pleasurable habit and habits are hard to break. but. cigarettes are also killers. if we can attack the causes right . let us at least open new doors for a possible cure. and hopefully before too many more lives are lost. by mr. mcgovern (for himself and mr. buardick):
i believe the senator raises a very important question. i understand exactly what he is trying to do. i believe he is performing a service by doing it. frankly.  just for the drug producers but. as he said. some drug producers may  even take the contracts or we may  get the vaccine if they have to be held to the language. however. it is  the intent of the committee or of this legislation to change existing law.  1.  2. the language says the drug producers "should" remain responsible for the vaccine. it does  say "shall." it just indicates what the suggestion of the senate committee was. and more than that. it is certainly  mandatory language. as the senator can very well see. i believe the important part is that it does  change the law. we will get an opinion from the assistant secretary for health after he looks at this. and if there is any necessity it will be dropped. we certainly do  intend to change the existing law. so far as the contract between the federal government and these pharmaceutical companies is concerned.
 of the united states or when i speak on the floor of the u.s. senate. tobacco subsidies are a good example of the protective. special interest legislation which this country can longer afford. our national goals of improving public health and producing high quality food grain at reasonable prices are supported by all americans. laws which help particular groups subvert these purposes must be repealed.
. let me say that i can allow my distinguished colleague to stand alone while he courageously fights for what he ks is right and what many of us k is right. i have great respect for my colleagues who have to represent their states which have tobacco industries. i have some tobacco industry in my own state of massachusetts. but my colleague from utah is exactly right. we have been hypocritical. in the hew bill. we have appropriated $850 million for research for cancer. we are trying to do the best we can to cure cancer. including lung cancer and the many other kinds of cancer excelebrated by cigarette smoke which claim the lives of so many of our people. yet. at the same time. we are subsidizing an industry that does  need subsidy and spending money to advertise at home and abroad to encourage more people to smoke more. how long are we going to tolerate such twofaced policies. such hypocrisy. i think it is time for more senators to support the senator from utah. his amendment is a good amendment. i have proposed it myself in the past. i believe in it. i k that every american would like to see us get rid of cancer in this country. and today there is doubt that cigarette smoking has caused lung cancer. we have shown recognition of this by requiring a health warning on the packaging of cigarettes. we are trying to do whatever we can on television to encourage people  to smoke. yet at the same time. here we are subsidizing that industry and encouraging it by adding appropriation of money for the advertising of tobacco abroad. i think that is a hypocritical act on our part. i hope that the senators amendment will be supported. i intend to vote for it. and i hope there will be more senators who will stand up and support the senator from utah. he has dealt with the ecoics of tobacco. he is trying to do the best he can. this is  as strong an amendment as we would like. but at least this amendment would cut out the appropriation for advertising of cigarettes. for which the federal government is paying. the industry should be paying for it. why should american taxpayers have to pay to advertise cigarettes and at the same time spend $850 million of their tax money to try to find a cure for cancer. if that is  irrational public policy i do  k what is. i hope the amendment of the senator from utah will be agreed to.
i would  argue with the figures which the distinguished senator from georgia has given. but i ask the senator why should the federal government pay for the advertising of a health hazard instead of food products for our foreign friends to buy. why  have the money for tobacco advertising at least come from the industry.
i agree. but i think we ought to serve warning that we will be back again and again. because we just ought  to be spending federal money for this purpose. especially  when we are spending all this money for cancer research to combat the effects of tobacco.
i am sure uhat my good friend from oklahoma has read the language which is contained in this house bill. it was  put in by the senate. it was put in by the house. the senator has been one of the leaders. together with senator helms of th carolina. in the socalled prolife movement on the senate floor. the house language in this appropriations bill is much broader than the language which is contained in the constitutional amendments which have been offered. because. under this language. even the health of the mother and the life of the mother can be protected. it goes so far that if tlhere were a need to have an abortion to protect the life of the mother and that mother were poor. that mother could  have an abortion under this language. i want to be sure that the senator understands that. because i think the senator has alwaysi k this is true of the senator from new york who. unfortunately is sick todaywanted to protect the life of the mother. many prolife people want to protect the life of the mother. but under this language. we can even protect the life of the mother. the senator is quite correct: i did say the other day that it is hypocrisy for the united states to be spending $850 million in cancer research and. at the same time. subsidizing tha tobaccc industry. which is. by means. a destitute industry. in order to have more people smoke and thereby contract lung cancer. which we are trying to alleviate. but we have to turn that argument around in this case. i think the senator has the right argument. but he is using it in the wrong place. i think the argument supports the senator from oregon. it is the life. it is the health of people tha we are trying to protect in the senators attempt to strike this house language. which goes much farther than what the senator from oklahoma has ever attempted to do or much farther than what the senator from th carolina has ever attempted to do.
it sounds. by implication. as though farmers are being taken advantage of. that we have all these inspectors. where do these inspectors come from. some people can handle power. i have seen it in some of the security guards at the airports. they are given authority. and power is a heady thing. it goes to their heads. and they may overstep their bounds. but that does  mean that the legislation or the appropriation for inspectors who will protect the health and safety of the farmworker and other workers is bad legislation or is a bad appropriation. i think we should find some way of getting at the inspector whose power has gone to his head and who is overstepping his bounds and is harassing the farmer or any other small business.
some have also argued that the returned bottles and cans will pose a public health hazard to the retail establishments handling them. i have looked into this question. and i am satisfied that. while some rearrangements may be necessary in small stores. the inconvenience can be dealt with. and that health hazards will  be a significant problem. i ask unanimous consent that two letters from public health officials which address this issue also be printed in the record following my remarks.
i thank my colleague. . i realize that it may seem like a fine point to argue for a figure as small as $0.2 billion. i point this out to the distinguished chairman and the ranking miity member. that that is a small amount in this resolution. but i want to impress upon them that $200 million provides a great deal of care for a great number of people. it makes thousands of hospital rooms safe for their occupants. it trains hundreds of doctors. dentists. and nurses. and i hope that the members of the committee on the budget will do everything in their power to persuade the members of the house that the $7.4 billion figure the senate has wisely included is a bare minimum level of support for these tools to protect the health of the american people. my colleague. the distinguished senior senator from massachusetts. who is the chairman of the senate health subcommittee. i believe. has sent a letter to the distinguished chairman of the committee on the budget and the ranking miity member. i ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the record at this point.
 for that purpose. after the full committee marked up the bill. it was called to my attention that the manner of the conimittee earmarking would preclude additional at- tention being given to overseas technical support for the volunteers. such support includes funding for program managers. training officers. technical advisers. and medical staff. it specifically excludes funding for country directors. administrative officers. and all clerical. financial. and operational staff members of the peace corps who may be located overseas. staff members of the senate committee on appropriations undertook field inspections of peace corps activities during the past 6 months. in those inspections they found several instances of inadequate technical support for our peace corps volunteers. such inadequacies included insufficient medical care. lack of ongoing effective training programs. weak program supervision at times. and insufficient numbers of technical advisers for volunteers. while some of these problems may have resulted from weaknesses in the running of the peace corps program. the main cause has likely been inadequate resources to allow improved overseas technical support for the volunteers. one of the purposes of senator hatfield and myself in advocating the additional $10 mfliior for the peace corps was to allow the corps to give greater attention to the technical support area than would have been the case under the program proposed by the administration. to accomplish this purpose. it is necessary to amend the original earmarking by the committee to allow $2.060.000 of the additional $10 million to be allocated to overseas technical support for volunteers. i have discussed this matter with the floor manager of the bill and he is agreeable to the amendment.
i certainly agree with my distinguished chairman. i think it is too bad that this is legislation. first of all. on an appropriations bill. second. it is a very important issue. it is an emotional issue. it is also a constitutional issue. it certainly is  an issue that should be the subject of politics and. certainly. in a presidential election. i would vote. obviously. for the bill itself. we have done so much work on this bill. as the senator ks. we worked day and night on this bill. we have had countless hearings. it is a bill involving money for all the health institutes. education. welfare. labor. and the rest. i do  interpret what we are voting on today to be a vote upon that itself. i think we are merely voting upon the motion relating to the matter in disagreement. though i will cast my vote against the motion on the disagreement. obviously. i did vote for the bill itself. i voted for it after the first conference. but the matter before us today is a disagreement that could  be resolved until .
. in a press conference on tuesday. september 14. 1976. i had the pleasure of anncing with dr. jack e. white. director of tl e howard university cancer research center. and dr. john f. potter. director of the vincent t. lombardi cancer research center of georgetown university. the inauguration of the cancer information service for metropolitan washington. this unique program is one of 17 being funded throughout the united states by the national cancer institute. each is affiliated with a comprehensive cancer center. and together they comprise a communications network whose purpose is to improve cancer care by disseminating information regarding cancer to the american public. the aim of the cancer information service is to provide accurate and uptodate information on cancerrelated subjects to the general public and health professionals in the greater washington area. to achieve this goal. it is their intention to work cooperatively and collaboratively with all agencies. institutions. and individuals who are interested in improved cancer control and cancer care. a comprehensive directory of resources will be available listing all agencies. institutions. and individuals concerned with cancer in the greater washington area. the latest information regarding the occurrence. cause. prevention. safeguards. detection and warning signals of cancer will be dispatched to the general public and health professionals on the subject of cancer. the telephone service will be staffed by volunteer operators with guidance and supervision provided by communications office personnel. following intensive training. these operators are capable of answering personal health questions posed by the general public. in addition. they will be assisted by a team of medical experts and consultants. who will respond to the more technical questions. these experts will be provided by the comprehensive cancer center as well as other health institutions in the washington. d.c. area. the cancer information service has made provisions for referral consultations for medical professionals. thus enabling physicians to have immediate access to experts in the field of cancer. concurrent with the telephone service. cancer communications for metropolitan washington will be engaged in a series of other activities. all of which is geared toward more effective dissemination of cancer information. included among these is a detailed brochure describing the service. a newsletter for health professionals. collaborative educational programs with existing cancer agencies. a calendar of cancer events occurring within the region. and a constant evaluation of the program. this comprehensive information service on cancer is invaluable to the american public. and will have a tremendous impact on cancer prevention and cancer care in the metropolitan d.c. community and throughout the united states. the tollfree number in the metropolitan area is 2322833.
. we all want to live full. long. and healthy lives. the recent advances of medical science have enabled more and more of our fellow americans to do this. one disease that remains unsolved is old age. and of the many changes attendant upon advancing years. the most distressing may be the failing of the senses. our senses are the crux of all that we are. to the extent that they are impaired. we are further removed from some aspect of life. all of our senses decline with age. as the senses become weaker. less accurate. -the ability to enjoy life is diminished. the natural tragedy of this process is compounded by the fact that today. as the result of startling techogical inations. much of the sense impairment is unnecessary. we have been able to augment failing senses and thus restore individuals to a productive and enjoyable life. but the availability of these deviceseyeglasses. for example. and prosthetic devicesare very expensive. one of the most serious gaps in our medicare program is the lack of coverage for vision services for the elderly. for the most part. medicare currently excludes optometrists from the definition of recognized practitioners under the program and prohibits payments for eyeglasses and eye examinations. and tragically egh. our persons over 65 years of age comprise the greatest bulk of the population needing vision care. over 20 percent of this age group compared to less than 1 percent of the total population suffer visual impairment. over 92 percent of our elderly have corrective lenses compared to roughly 50 percent of the population. i feel we can allow the absence of necessary vision services to impede even a single person from functioning to the full extent of his capabilities. and therefore. i am today introducing a bill to amend medicare to include coverage of vision services. as well as outofhospital prescription drugs and prosthetic devices. prescription drugs are aher crucial problem for our elderly. as they become older many elderly develop chronic illnesses whose pain and discomfort can be eased by todays miracle drugs. but they too are expensive. and the older persons on a fixed income should  be forced to make the choice between a needed prescription and food for the table. but this happens and it must stop. therefore. we must amend our medicare program to enable our elderly to live in dignity and security. and as comfortably as possible. by mr. brooke:
. i am very concerned about the underutilization of home health services. primarily because of the stringent requirements set forth in the social security act under medicare. home health services are comprised of an array of therapeutic and preventive services provided to patients in their home or foster homes because of acute illness. exacerbations of chronic illness. and disability. these services vary depending on need. the department of health. education. and welfare has described three levels of home health care: first. concentrated or intensive services. second. intermediate services. and finally. third. basic services. defined as "a simple combination of health supervision and maintenance designed to maintain individuals who have longtermcare needs in their own home. thus preventing or postponing the need for institutionalization." these basic services have the greatest potential for utilization by large segments of the population. and are designed to support and maintain daily living activities of individuals who might otherwise require care in an institution. one way we can encourage the use of home health services is to pass legislation that would waive the 3day prior hospitalization requirementor 3day stay in a skilled nursing facilitythat presently is mandatory for receiving home health care benefits in the medicare program. today i am introducing legislation to amend the social security act to waive this requirement. there is a widespread consensus that we are overutilizing our institutional care. it has been estimated that as much at 25 percent of our elderly currently institutionalized could be happier and just as comfortable with the help of home health care in their homes. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. these services are less costly. and more appropriate for large numbers of our elderly. by mr. brooke:
. some have also argued that the return bottles and cans will pose a public health hazard to the retail establishments handling them. i have looked into this question. and i am satisfied that. while some rearrangements may be necessary in small stores. the inconvenience can be dealt with. and that health hazards will  be a significant problem. i ask unanimous consent that two letters from public health officials which address this issue also be printed in the record following my remarks.
. problem in our nation should rank higher on our list of national priorities than adequate health care at a reasonable cost for all our citizens. but instead we find ourselves in the dilemma of having probably the most superb medical service in the world. yet at a price which an increasing number of americans are simply unable to afford. . there seems end to the escalating health care costs. between 1974 and 1975. the medical consumer price index went up over 12 percent. a rate far above the overall cost of living increase. hospital service charges rose by 15 percent. physicians fees rose by 12.3 percent. the total national health expenditures increased from $104 billion in 1974 to $118.5 billion in 1975. and national health expenditures as a percentage of gross national product increased from 7.7 percent in 1974 to 8.3 percent in 1975. the cost of medical service is one of the primary reasons for our national health problems. and these problems are pervasive and tragic. even in the midst of our affluence. aspect of our health care dilemma offers so stark a portrait of our failure as the health care which we inflict upon our children. or more to the point. which we neglect to give them. the figures about the infant mortality rate alone tell the story. in 1970. the united states had an infant mortality rate of almost 20 per thousand. in contrast. france had only 15. denmark 14.8. japan 13. and sweden 11.7. and even more disturbing. a study done in recent years showed that of 34 countries examined. the united states had the least favorable reduction of infant mortality of any of the industrial countries. thus. how we reverse these figures. both in terms of cost and of availability of decent medical care. is of crucial importance. and reverse them we must. i have long called for national health insurance as the means by which to do this. the support for national health insurance has grown in recent years to the point where most americans agree that something must be done about health care. and this support will continue to grow as health care is increasingly priced beyond the reach of  only the poor but even middle class americans. disappointingly. the government has failed to respond. many national health insurance bills have been introduced in congress. but e has passed. many studies have been done in the executive branch showing how much a plan for national health care is needed. but the administration persists in telling us that we can afford it. i believe that we can afford  to have adequate medical care for all our citizens. for this reason. and because comprehensive national health insurance seems logjammed in the congress and executive branch. i join with senator javits in introducing a bill which would provide health coverage to children and pregnant women. while medicare and medicaid provide health care for our elderly and for the needy. the national health insurance for mothers and children act will take us yet aher step forward in building a structure of comprehensive national health insurance. the bill establishing a comprehensive system of national health insurance for mothers and children would provide medical service to children up until the age of 18 and to mothers during preg nancy and for 12 weeks after birth. these ages and these periods represent a crucial time in the life of a person. laying a foundation of good or bad health which will follow a person for the rest of her or his life. a child would be provided with comprehensive ambulatory and hospital care. this care would include home health. rehabilitative. and mental health service. a -mother would be provided with all appropriate prenatal and post partum health care for women. up to 12 weeks after childbirth. preventive health care would be stressed for both mothers and children. quite frankly. i would much prefer the january 19. .1977 enactment of comprehensive national health insurance covering everyone. but we have waited too long for this. and i feel that if we can have a comprehensive national health insurance at once. we must build it brick by brick. including group after group. our legislation. which we  propose this week. is aher important step in this building process.
. that in terms of the total budget of the agriculture department. three staff people would be handling 60 percent of all agriculture committee business. this is clearly inadequate. it would seem to indicate to us and to those who denend upon the nutrition committee that its functions would be given but short shrift if the stevenson committee proposal is enacted. the work of the select committee on nutrition has been invaluable as can be attested to by the 50 million americans directly affected by programs developed by the committee: the school lunch program. the special supplemental feeding programs for women. infants. and children. the school breakfast program. and the nutrition program for the elderly. the committees present work examining and publicizing preventive health care through improved nutrition proves that its work in health and nutrition is far from finished. if we support the stevenson committee proposal there is serious doubt that it will be. for all these reasons. i shall vote for and urge my colleagues to support the mcgoverndole amendment to continue the needed. and important work of the select committee on nutrition and human needs.
. it is my unhappy purpose. today. to call to the attention of the senate yet aher condition of drought in haiti. many of my colleagues will remember the severe drought conditions that afflicted the haitian people in 1975. while some respite from those conditions occurred in 1976. it  appears that improved conditions were just a brief respite from continued tragedy. insufficient rainfall during the latter part of 1976 has led to extensive crop failures in thwest haiti and on the island of gonave. both these areas. as well as other parts of haiti. provide a marginal standard of living for their inhabitants even in the best of times. under drought conditions these people simply can survive without outside assistance. on march 21. 1977. the u.s. ambassador to haiti declared that a disaster existed and requested the use of disaster relief funds for the costs of air shipping and operating temporary power generating capacity for about 1 month. a subsequent request was forwarded to the department of defense by the agency for international development for the loan of four 750 kw generators to haiti and their transportation to that country as soon as possible. aid has also arranged with the center for disease control in atlanta for the dispatch of a cdc epidemiologist to haiti to assess the dangers of disease under the drought conditions. credit should be given to the work of voluntary agencies who. with limited resources. are making a major contribution to the drought relief effort. aid summarizes several of these efforts in the following manner: care. inc.. and church world services in february asked for supplemental title ii shipments totalling $592.900 for use in food for work projects. this assistance has been approved for approximately 2.5 million man/ days of work from 19.000 workers who support about 66.000 dependents. a cable received in aid/w april 4 indicated that red cross field representatives had reported a significant increase in mortality rate in thwest haiti and gonave and requested 120 tons of dried milk as further title ii assistance. a telegram sent april 5 approved the request. this food is to be shipped to haiti by care and distributed by the red cross to approximately 20.500 infants or pregnant/lactating women for three months. it is also evident that haiti will require additional foodstuffs to meet the emergency. on march 30 the government of haiti requested an additional 10.000 tons each of corn and rice to be sold under public law 480. title i provisions. unless conditions improve in the near future. it appears reasonable to assume that further requests will be forthcoming. as one who has a deep affinity with the haitian people. their continued suffering is a heartrending spectacle. it is in the best humanitarian traditions of the american people that our country stands ready to provide the assistance the haitians need to meet this latest disaster and improve their capacity to become more selfsustaining in the future.
. i am pleased to have brought this to the attention of the distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee. and the distinguished ranking miity member of the senate subcommittee. the senator from pennsylvania . i hope they will see fit to accept this amendment.
. i am well aware that the distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee. my senior colleague from massachusetts. has been interested in this area and ks it well. i trust that he. together with my distinguished colleague. the ranking miity member. the senator from pennsylvania . will accept this amendment.
 mondale. was a leader in this field. the committee has done well. the purpose of my amendments is to make counseling services possible for the areas in this country that are   receiving such services. but this amendment offers  only counseling services for parents. it also offers education about this mysterious disease to the public at large. as ranking miity member of the laborhew appropriations subcommittee. i also am working on increasing the research funds for sids so that we can discover the cause of crib death. many young families live in fear during the first year of their childs life that they will wake in the morning and find that child longer alive. the nation must direct its attention to this dread killer. i thank my distinguished colleague from massachusetts and the distinguished senator from pennsylvania for accepting this amendment
for controllable health programs. the senate appropriations committee recommended $8.6 billion for fiscal year 1978. this amount was the result of careful consideration by our committee. we believe that increased funding is needed in health services. biomedical research. research training. and support. health professions training and health planning. to cite just a few important areas. most or all have been hard hit by inflation and there is need for program expansion to capitalize on gains already made and to reach more of the disadvantaged. i would. of course. prefer the budget committee adopt the $8.6 billion we recommended. and i hope we can live with the $8.3 billion that you have decided upon. on the other hand. the house recommendation of $7.6 billion is far too low. thus i hope when you go to confer1.3589 ence with the house. you will feel that $8.3 billion is a sound figure and that you will fight to preserve it. would you advise me whether this is your view and your intention. may we have the senators comments on this point.
is it correct that the primary health care programs. such as maternal and child health. community health centers. and hmos. are already required to provide family planning services by their legislative authorities and that we intend that they meet this mandate with the funds we have appropriated pursuant to these authorities.
i certainly agree with my distinguished colleague from maryland. . this amendment would cut $81 million total. $60 million from construction and $21 million from services. what it would do would be to really defeat rural and urban health initiatives that should be taken.
that is correct. but it is still an $81 million cut. as i said. but the senator is correct. there is. however. an active outreach program to provide necessary health maintenance and immunization. we certainly would  be able to do that with this cut. on full participation in health planning we would  be able to do that either with this cut. as the distinguished chairman said. we find that all of these hospitals. in order to restock their drug and medical care supplies. because of lack of funds have had to cut back. curtail. and they have had supplies of only 1 week to a month on hand. so. . for all of these reasons we hope the senate would  accept this amendment. we discussed it at some length before in the committee. and we feel the funding level we have proposed to the senate is a sound one. we hope there will be further cuts in public health service hospitals
i say to the senator that i understand the purpose of his amendment. but the increasing demands of health care are making greater demands of registered nurses. there are evolving roles that require that nurses continue their education beyond basic nursing programs. without loan and other assistance. student nurses will  be able to enter health professions training programs. our committee has made. as the chairman has said. a 25percent cut in nurses capitation funds. which was reduced from $40 million to $30 million. and which is $2 million less than the house figure. the budget request for 1978 for nursing was $100 million under the 19t appropriation. at the present time. only about 20 percent of nurses have baccalaureate or higher degrees and the projected demand for 1980 is for more than 50 percent of nurses to need more than baccalaureate degrees. even though i certainly understand the senators bringing up this amendment. i am glad that he is just discussing this question and  pressing the amendment at this time.
. i offer an amendment allowing funding for abortions where the life of the mother is endangered. where medically necessary. or for the treatment of rape or incest. the amendment would also place prohibition on the use of drugs or devices to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum. i would emphasize that my amendment differs from the language in the committee bill solely in that it would substitute the words "where medically necessary" for the four medical conditions  specified in the bill. we all agree that medical exceptions must be made. but there is  one doctor among us. we do  have the competence to make medical decisions which a doctor and a doctor alone is trained and qualified to make. the committee bill language which i wish to amend stands as a testament to the absurdity and tragedy of what occurs when we do attempt to make medical judgments. doctors have questioned me as to why only two medical conditions affecting the health and  the life of the pregnant woman. multiple sclerosis and renal disease. are allowed as exceptions in the senate bill. for there are other medical conditions and diseases which have a far greater detrimental effect on the health of a pregnant woman. shall we tell doctors. and poor women. that women with these two diseases were to be permitted abortions solely because a member of the house delegation to the conference on last years bill insisted that his concern for these two conditions be expressed in the report language accompanying the bill. and that the senate appropriations committee this year simply voted to incorporate last years illogical report language into this years bill. are we to tell doctors all across the country that this is the rational and kledgeable way the senate dictates decisions which affect them and the health of their patients. there is alternative: we must either allow doctors to make the decisions only they are qualified to make or have medical decisions determined by chance. the chance of persuading individual senators or congressmen to offer amendments excepting particular diseases or medical conditions from the ban on abortion. the latter would be intolerable. my amendment would leave medical decisions where they so clearly belong. with the doctors. i am sure that after careful consideration my colleagues will agree that this is the only appropriate course. for us to do otherwise would be an arrogance which will have the most tragic consequences. for us to do otherwise would show a disregard for the health of thousands.
the language which i have included is the language used in the social security laws or in other federal laws pertaining to matters where medical funds are used for medical purposes. it says. "medically necessary." so whatever the doctor would determine to be medically necessary would be covered by this amendment.
it is the senators intent that the doctor would have to make a medical determination and would  take the word of the pregnant mother. he would have to make a medical determination as to whether it would be necessary. . if that would include a psychological problem. i do  k. but it would be the doctors determination and  the expectant mothers determination.
i would think we would  want to subject the doctor to our determination as to what is medically necessary. i do  k that i am competent to make that decision. or that the senate is competent to make that decision. i do k in the language presently in the bill we do except two diseases. one is renal disease and the other is multiple sclerosis. i see reason why we should except two diseases when there are other diseases which are much more dangerous to the life of the mother and to the fetus itself. so what i would do here is leave it up to the determination of the doctor as to what is medically necessary. that is all.
. events of the past decade have indicated that in many regions of the world the capacity to produce food at levels necessary to meet minimum nutrition levels is lacking. this was certainly the case in the sahelian area of africa during the early years of the 1970s. it is the case today in haiti. cape verde. bangladesh. and other countries. even in countries that presently can meet minimum food needs. the situation is so precarious that any change in climatic conditions results in a serious and rapid deterioration in food production capabilities. concern over the worlds food producing capacity have led many of us in the senate to work for greater u.s. involvement in efforts to improve agricultural practices around the world. such efforts include the international fund for agricultural development. increased emphasis on funding for food and nutrition related projects in our bilateral programs and increased support for agricultural development efforts of the various international financial institutions. in addition. efforts are underway in the senate and elsewhere to encourage the establishment of a worldwide grain reserve system. given the preeminence of the united states in the area of agricultural production. our country should play a major role in this effort. as we seek to insulate the worlds people from the most severe ravages of food deficits. it is necessary to maintain a constant vigil regarding weather conditions affecting world agriculture. in this regard. the environment data service of the department of commerce publishes a weekly report entitled "major abmal weather conditions affecting world agriculture." which provides both early warning and updated information on conditions that may affect agricultural productivity. i find this to be one of the more useful documents i receive each week and believe my colleagues will find it equally so. therefore. i ask unanimous consent that the report for the week of july 1420. 1977. be printed in the rzcord at this point.
i will after a moment. there are some diseases that are worse than death. take the taysachs disease. for example. when a child is afflicted with it. that child will live at most 3 or 4 years. and while that child is living that child is going to be in pain and is going to be suffering. abortion is the only humane thing to do to avoid such an instance. if the judgment is made by a physician that that pregnancy should be aborted. then it should be aborted. that is what we are saying. so we admit that it is a question of health as well as life. and as i said before there are many health conditions that are even worse than death itself. so let us  say we are misleading anyone. we are  trying to mislead anyone. what we are saying by rejecting the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania is that we are too humane. we are too wise to go back to the position where we do  even include rape and incest and where. if it is medically necessary to save the life of that patient. to save the health of that patient and the health of that fetus. we will  do so. we are saying that we will leave it up to doctors.  to the senator from new mexico.  to the senator from massachusetts. neither of whom. in my opinion. are competent to make that judgment.
the key point that i make is  a percentage of how many have been saved. when there is an abortion. i presume there are e that are going to be saved. but what i am saying. there is abortion to preserve the life of that mother or that that child will  be born. as i said. with taysachs disease or sickle cell anemia or that if the child lives after the mother has had breast cancer and has to take chemotherapy. for example. and the fetus is injured thereby. there are many. many situations. but we are getting into medical questions. i say rather than the senator from oklahoma and the senator from massachusetts getting into medical questions. which i presume the senator from oklahoma is  much more prepared to make judgment on than i. then i say let us leave it to the doctors. and that is what the senate said.
medical science has made the determination that if the mother has a certain disease or is being treated by certain drugs it will have a certain effect upon a fetus. that is the medical determination. but again we are getting into medical science. i do  think the senator from oklahomaand i am  being facetiousis a doctor. i assure him i am  a doctor.
i think the senator from oklahoma ks that there are thousands of genetic diseases. all kinds of diseases that could have an adverse effect upon the life of the mother. the health of the mother. and the health of the fetus. as the senator ks. in the conference report language of the 1977 appropriation bill. we listed renal disease and multiple sclerosis. the report language excluded other diseases far more dangerous. perhaps. than renal disease and multiple sclerosis. again. that shows the incompetence of congress to sit in judgment on such matters. i want to make one further remark to the senator from new mexico.
the senator ks polls. he has used polls in his campaign. he uses them very well. obviously. because the senator has been elected and reelected. he understands polling. he also understands the significance of how questions are framed. in the poll the senator mentioned. was there a question whether the public would favor medicaid abortions for poor women. if it is medically necessary.
we also want to tell hew what we mean by a "public health service or its equivalent." a public health service is one that serves the public in the immediate local area. or over a wider region. it could be a government service and in many areas likely would be. but where such government service does  exist. we intend that the private sector equivalent of such service would be eligible to receive the relevant report. thus. in addition to services funded from public moneys we also would include services funded by a combination of public and private moneys. or even moneys totally from the private sector. if that is the best "equivalent" that can be found. thus. authorized recipients of reports would include. but  be limited to. family planning organizations. health maintenance organizations. rape crisis centers. health and counseling centers run by local charitable organizations. special phonein counseling services. or any kind of neighborhood or other health or counseling center for people with problems. we also intend that hew make certain the health center alternative is. at a minimum. available to each community and within easy reaching distance. we do  want to find situations where hew has  made a good faith effort to provide the alternative of reporting to a health center. would the distinguished manager from the state of south carolina agree with my definition as to what we mean by a "public health service or its equivalent".
i think that should be very clear. crystal clear. for the record. . . i think this clarifies the intent of the senate. and i think of the house as well. as to any language which may cause the secretary some problem insofar as the promulgation of regulations is concerned. i think all of the other language here is clear on its face. i do  see any ambiguity. as i review this language. that could cause the secretary to want to seek further any legislative intent. we k. when we are talking about medical procedures. that we are talking about abortions. we k. when we are talking about severe and longlasting physical health damage. that that is something that will be determined by a physician. because he is the only one who can determine that. we are  in a position to determine what severe and longlasting physical health damage might be. it would be different from case to case. that is a medical determination that must be made. we k what we axe talking about when we say "when so determined by two physicians." it does  restrict the woman to two physicians. she can go to more physicians. the "reasonable" test will be used. we also k that medicaid will pay for those physicians and for those consultations and the accompanying examinations and tests. but we also expecti should say i also expectthat that provision will be declared unconstitutional. we k what we are talking about when we say the reporting must be prompt and that it must be within a reasonable and humane period of time. having all of that clearly spelled out for the secretary of hew. i can see reason why he should have any difficulty whatsoever in the promulgation and drafting of regulations that will be in keeping with the intent of this congress and the passage of this language.
that is right. and i agree with the distinguished chairman again. we wanted "fetus" in there. and i hope that some time we will progress to the point that "fetus" will be included because we get into the taysachs disease and others that are too horrible even to mention. that are excluded by virtue of the fact we have had to compromise this language time after time after time. i think we have made a clear legislative record if i may. to he distinguished senator from pennsylvania who wants to speak in this matter.
. at the recent annual meeting of the american association of psychiatric services for children. where the theme of the conference was "developing new ways of meeting the needs of children and their families." the keye address was made by senator jacob k. javits of new york. senator javits focused the audiences attention on our bill. national health insurance for mothers and children act as the strategy: first as a logical incremental step toward universal health benefits coverage that can be acted on . and second highlight preventive rather than curative medicine and promote health policies that go beyond the limits of medicine. senator javits and i have long been advocates of ending the stigma. fear. and misunderstanding of mental illnessa tragedy perpetuated by books. the media. and the conduct of everyday life itselfand we have urged encouragement and incentives for the public to use preventive services such as crisis intervention and early diagis. we are both most sympathetic to the vast. pervasive and everincreasing needs and problems of mental illness. we both believe that as we develop national health insurance legislation we should include coverage for the 20 million or more persons in this nation who are in need of some form of mental health care. yet it is urgent that as we begin the creative process for a comprehensive health program for all of our citizens we must be compassionate but realistic. as a friend of the mental health caring community. i want them to k that i support fully senator javits challenge to them that mental health professionals begin to define what procedures should be in the hands of medical professionals. best trained to carry them out. and where others of the mental health disciplines may more appropriately be usedfor example. social and peer intervention. in addition. we must end concerns about reimbursement for medical health professional reimbursement and reach an accord regarding the division of roles and responsibilities. i share his concern that if we fail to establish boundaries of treatments and carefully articulated and defined psychiatric services. it will all ultimately work to the disadvantage of mentally ill patients. also. i agree with senator javts that there is "a congressional consensus. that our existing mental health care delivery system does  provide clear lines of clinical accountability for the various mental health disciplines. and for their relationships with each other." i commend to the attention of my colleagues the full text of that portion of the senators speech entitled: "needed: a common concept of mental health." and ask unanimous consensus that it be printed in the record.
 kevin harrington. but never missed an opportunity to give rep. mike harrington a zing in print. jim had his strong likes and dislikes and never tried to hide them. shea.became a celebrity around the th shore. and his saturday political column was the most widely read in any newspaper circulated there. he became an afterdinner speaker. and usually just jotted down a few es and ad libbed the rest in the don rickles style. he could occasionally be cruel but he never. never was a bore.  jim. the happiest night of. his life probably came last june when he and his gentle marianne were hoed by their two daughters and three sons on their 25th wedding anniversary. the party was at his woodbury street home and his old friends turned up at that happy occasion when the kids presented their parents airline tickets to ireland. a few nights later he awoke in pain and the next stop was the hospital and that is when his long ordeal began. it ended at 2:30 a.m. yesterday. but a few days earlier. shea called marianne from the hospital and dictated part of his own obituary. he had that special style right to the end. so tonight the wake will begin at charlie campbells in th beverly and friends and admirers. and even a few enemies. will show up to pay their last respects to james michael shea. he was really something.9
. as the senator ks. for he is the very distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee. 25 percent of the persons living in nursing homes really do  have to be there. there is other place for them to live. and they are sent off to nursing homes or hospitals or other institutions. the one thing the elderly fear most is institutionalization. and finally we are coming to the conclusion that it is  even costeffective for us to institutionalize the elderly citizens of this country. if you talk to them. they say. "my god. do  put me in this nursing home or in an institution." but if we keep cutting back here. there will be other place for them to go. it will be costing us more money. and they will  be living in dignity in the decent housing they would rather live in. so i would hope the senate would look at it from that point of view. that the elderly would suffer.
. this amendment. as the distinguished senator from alabama has said. would make available for hospitals the existing fha insured mortgage program for refinancing multifamily rental projects. that is in section 223 (f) of the national housing act. it is expected that extending this program to hospital financing could have an impact on reducing hospital costs. the program would only be available for financially sound hospitals with certificates of need approved by appropriate state or federal agencies. i have discussed this matter with the distinguished chairman of the committee. senator proxmire. and we both support this amendment and commend the senator from alabama for having proposed it. we are ready to accept that amendment
madam president. i join with my chairman. senator magnuson. in recommending that the senate adopt the fiscal 1979 laborhew appropriations bill as reported by the senate appropriations committee. the bill we are recommending totals $56.474.666.000. this is $1.110.436.000 under the house allowance and $868.010.000 under the presidents requests for fiscal 1979. we have deferred funding for $17 billion in programs which expire september 30 and for which new authorizing legislation has  been enacted. it is unusual for our committee to talk about a laborhew bill that is below the levels of both the house and of the president. in the senate we are accustomed to citing the fact that our laborhew bills are generous because of the senates special sensitivity to programs to aid the poor. the sick. the undereducated and those otherwise disadvantaged. but this year we have encountered some special circumstances that have worked to hold down the amounts we could agree to. the current rampant inflation. the administrations holdtheline approach to appropriations for federal social programs and the chilling effects of proposition 13 all have had their impact. as a result we have developed a bill that provides for some new initiatives and expansions but which basically will just maintain the status quo in most health. education. and other social programs. in some areas. such as cancer research. we will be worse off because we have  provided egh to cover continuation of the 1978 level of activity in addition to providing for inflation. we always must be prudent with the taxpayers dollar. but we must never forget that we are dealing with lives as well as with dollars. in many instances those lives have been torn apart by joblessness. by illness and disease. by poverty. and even by discrimination. i believe congress has made a strong commitment to helping the less fortunate of our society and it is through the laborhew bill that we try to fulfill this commitment. our resolve to extend a helping hand to the needy and the impaired must  weaken and i am hopeful that over the longer run this wi.l be the case. let me list some of the actions taken by our committee in the fiscal 1979 laborhew bill: labor our committee provided $4.1 billion in both federal and trust funds for department of labor programs. but deferred funding for some $11.1 billion in ceta and other manpower programs because of the lack of new authorizing legislption for fiscal year 1979. the committee provides a total of $174.9 million for the occupational safety and health administration. osha. this is an increase of $7.5 million over the house. the added funds will provide osha with some 400 additional compliance officers and support personnel to expand the agencys ability to check for health and safety violations dangerous to workers. even with this increase in the compliance staff. osha still will reach only about 3 percent of the nations businesses covered by the occupational safety and health law. we also allow $12.5 million to provide onsite consultation services for employers concerned about health and safety problems in their places of work. our committee restored $600.000 and 28 positions deleted by the house for continuing the construction industry coordinating committee in chicago and establishing similar committees in other cities. possibly including boston. i believe such committees serve a useful purpese in reducing unemployment and modifying government practices that have raised the cost of public construction. health our committee provides a total of $5.3 billion for the health programs administered by the department of health. education. and welfare. our committee did  consider $1.8 billion in health programs for which authorization expires next month. in many cases. these authorizations still have  been renewed. following are some of the actions taken by the committee in the health area: we provide $177 millionan increase of $24.4 million over the house and the presidentto maintain comprehensive health and medical services for beneficiaries of the public health service hospitals. including our own in boston. we provide $925 million for cancer research. while this is $35.8 million above the house allowance. it is $25 million less than our subcommittee recommendation. the national cancer institute advises that it will require some $950 million in fiscal 1979 to provide for continuing the 1978 level of competing and competing research grant awards and for covering the impact of inflation. finding a cure for cancer is essential in itself. but the ecoic impact should  be iged. for example. the national cancer institute reports that a drug regimen developed by nci several years ago and  accepted throughout the world is alone responsible for curing 2.000 hodgkins disease patients each year just in the united states. nci conservatively estimates that. over the remainder of their working lives. each group of 2.000 cured patients will add $600 million to the gross national product and some $120 million to the nations tax revenue. multiply this estimate by the prospects for progress against other cancers and one can easily see that the dollar savings would be astroical. the federal cancer research program thus can be justified as a sound investment and  as a drain on government funds. the ecoic costs of cancer currently are estimated at between $25 billion and $30 billion each year. it seems to me to be simple commonsense to me to spend less than $1 billion a year to try to save up to $30 billion a year. this is aher and important side to the issue of fiscal prudence. in addition to the psychological factor that is involved. rhink of the numbers of women who live in constant fear of cancer attacking them each and every year. of course. it is  limited only to women. it includes men and children as well. all are living in fear of cancer attacking them. so. psychologically. the impact is great. in other areas our committee provides $485 million for the national heart. lung. and blood institute. the same level as the house. at this level the institute will  be able to fund new program initiatives to deal with hypertension. adult acute respiratory failure. and conservatior of blood supplies. it also will  be able to cover all of the contracts for which commitments already have been made. we provide $287.8 million for the national institute of arthritis. metabolism. and digestive diseases. again the same level as the house. i regret we were  successful in committee in attempting to add $20 million to deal with diabetes. the  3 killer of americans. and also to deal with arthritis. cystic fibrosis. and other fatal diseases. however. i am pleased that we were able to provide $225 million for the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke. the $36 million increase above the house will enable the institute to begin implementing the recommendations of the commissions on huntingtons disease and epilepsy. we  have a chance to do something significant in the field of epilepsy and i urge the institute to give epilepsy research at least equal treatment with its work on huntingtons disease. in addition. i was pleased we were able to maintain the $100 million allowance provided by the house for the national eye institute. this is $18.1 million above the administrations holdtheline request. our bill also provides $37 million to build a new research laboratory facility for the national institute of child health and human development. nichd is the only one of 11 national health institutes that does  have its own principal intramural research facility. it is badly in need of additional space. i also am glad that we provide an extra $1 million to maintain our valuable primate research centers at their 1978 level and that we have provided an additional $1.9 million to hold public health traineeships at least at their 1978 level of $7 million. for mental health research. our committee restored $6 million cut by the house and provided an additional $10 million to bolster training in the mental health field. our committees actions were prompted by the report of the presidents commission on mental health which focused on unmet needs in both areas. however. i deeply regret the committee decision to cut capitation for medical and health professions schools by $22.1 million below the house level. a recent general accounting office report points out that capitation "has played an important role in medical education." at present. hew says that scholarship and loan programs can cover only about 10 percent of the need. we all k that the alternative to reduced capitation is unacceptably higher college tuition.
 and to commend him for introducing his amendment. i am really somewhat sorry he has to withdraw it. i understand the reason why he is withdrawing it. but i hope it will buttress the conferees on the senate side when they go to conference with the house of representatives. we have $925 million in the senate bill. as the senator from kansas very well ks. that will hardly do the job. the national cancer institute said $950 million is a barebones minimum. i was concerned. as the senator from kansas ks. in trying to get the senate figure up to at least $950 million. so when we go to conference with the house. i hope the senate will stand firm at $925 million. i think the senator from kansas. by introducing his amendment. will certainly buttress that. i k the senator from indiana feels very strongly. he still might have an amendment to increase the amount. but it is imoortant that at a minimum we hold this amount. we are making progress in our attack on cancer and trying hopefully to find some cures. we made great progress. and we certainly can afford to falter  even with this proposition 13 running rampant through the country. we are talking about dollars here. but more importantly we are talking about people and lives here in this appropriation bill. so i want to commend the senator from kansas for having introduced his amendment. i support the concept and the theory of it. as i said. i am sorry. but i can tell him at least for one member of that conference we will fight hard to keep that $925 million as a bare bones minimum in the congressional bill ultimately when it comes out.
i just want to point out the strong language used in the committee report on this question of nutrition. i certainly agree with the distinguished senator from south dakota. the report states: at the same time. the committee wishes to stress its concern over the failure of the institute to put greater emphasis on diet and nutrition as potentially significant links with cancer. tn 1976. nci testified before the senate select committee on nutrition and human needs that 40 percent of the cancers in men and 60 percent in women are nutritionrelated. although the appropriations committee subsequently recommended a substantial funding increase for the dietnutrition program. the institute has  complied. the committee is most displeased with this and directs nci to significantly increase its budget for nutrition research. particularly with respect to preventing cancer and utilizing hyperalimentation in the treatment of cancer. i just want to show the distinguished senators from kansas and south dakota. who have done so much in the field of nutrition. that the committee was mindful of their concern. as this strong language indicates.
the secretary came out recently in a speech in which he indicated that cancer today. 20 percent of cancer is what he said. in the united states is workrelated. that is up from 1 percent to 5 percent. which we have been hearing for a long period of time. so there is a relationship between these working conditions and the incidence of cancer.
 if i may pursue this a little further. the same information which was released from the occupational safety and health administration that i read. dated friday. september 1. would indicate to me that osha is trying to do everything it possibly can in addition to the suspension so far as the batting is concerned. it says: in addition. osha is requesting public comment on a health hazard evaluation of mattress plant workers conducted by the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh). both the suspension and request for comments are included in a federal register ice published today. osha has suspended application of the cotton dust standard for these industries in response to a request for an administrative stay of the standard from the national cotton batting institute and the textile fibers and byproducts association. this request brought to oshas attention for the first time a draft repcrt of a niosh health hazard evaluation of stearns and foster mattress workers. after preliminary review of this report. osha has determined that the study warrants further review. in other words. i think the whole te of osha action is that they are willing to do everything they possibly can to help the industry through this period without. at the same time. risking the life and the health of the workers. if that is true. i can see why then the senator from louisiana would want to press his amendment at this time.
but wherever the regulations would impose an overburden on the industry. it seems to me that there is an attitude that exists at osha to do everything they possibly can to help the industryshort of sacrificing. of course. the health and safety of the workers. which is their responsibility. we have  always found that. to be sure. but in recent years i believe osha has tried to be reasonable.
. i remember as a child in elementary school there was a teacher who took a cigarette. inhaled from it. and then blew on a white handkerchief. the nicotine left a brown stain on that white handkerchief. the teacher said. "every time you inhale a cigarette. this is what happens to your lungs." there were about 50 children in my class. i do  k what the impact was upon those 50 children. but i do k what impact it had upon me. i have never smoked a cigarette in my life. or smoked anything else. merely because of that teachers influence upon me. showing me what the danger was to my health. that is health education in its basic. simplest form. i daresay that in elementary schools across this country today we do  even have anything as simple or as elementary as that. so a lot of these kids are growing up.  only teenagers but preteenagers. who are beginning to smoke. who think it is important to smoke. who because of their peers believe it is good to smoke. and it gives them security to smoke. they end up from preteenage on caught by a habit which is detrimental to their health.  we k that 40 percent of lung cancer is related to smoking. i ask most respectfully to my distinguished colleague from kentucky. for whom i have great respect. with the small. infinitesimal amount of money appropriated by the house. namely the $1.4 million for the whole country. for all health education to prevent problems in health. including but  limited to smokinghow far does he really think that amount of money would go towards preventing health hazards for people in this country. the answer is obvious. we could use $1.4 million right here in the nations capital. much less what could be used ina state as large as new york. california. or in the state of washington. so when we added the $4.5 million. we were  adding very much money at all. we were just barely trying to give them some kind of a program that would be the beginning of preventive health education for young people in the united states of america. therefore. as much as i personally would like to accept the senators amendment. and i can say what my distinguished chairman would do. i. for one. feel that we ought to be doing more in this field. i think it is cost effective to do more. but i think it is also more humane to do more. therefore. i say rather than to be decreasing the amount. i would like to see us increase the amount for health education for young people in this country.
five million dollars of this amount has been provided by the committee to be used for the smoking and health programs. actually. most of the program is smoking related. that is why we wanted to increase it. that was intentionally done. because that is where the real danger is. the real problem to these young people comes from smoking. the senator would  deny that.
it is very descriptive of what the intention of this committee was. i think it is a wellwritten report. the staff says this. and this was adopted. of course. by the committee: activities to be funded by this increase include demonstration prevention programs in schools. model community prevention programs involving industry. labor. schools. health facilities. health professionals. and voluntary organizations. establishment of training centers for teachers. development of public information programs. and conducting basic evaluations to measure the impact of these community programs. attention should also be placed on providing effective educational materials on smoking and health to groups that are showing an increase in smoking such as women. preteens and miities. it is the expectation of the committee that the smoking and health program will coordinate its activities throughout the department and that the committee will be regularly informed on all aspects of the smoking and health program. that certainly seems to me to be allinclusive with respect to children.
ial request and a house allowance of $1.4 million. it is hing. it can begin to educate the young people in this country. or anyone else in this country. to the dangers of smoking. i hope the bill that the senator from kentucky referred to. that is. from the health subcommittee and the human resources committee. will pass the u.s. senate and pass the congress. i will be very proud to vote for it. i think it sounds wonderful that that would be true. but more people die before they would mally die because of disease directly attributable to tobacco usage than from any other preventable cause of disease. the national institutes of health has estimated that in 1977 more than 348.000 people died prematurely from heart disease. cancer. and respiratory diseases attributable to smoking. i could go on with all kinds of statistics. i do  think we need to go into that. but i do want to point out to the senator from kentucky that the authorization for this purpose is $6 million in 1980. $8 million in 1981. and $8 million in 1982. so the authorization is already there. for 3 years. for those amounts. all we have tried to do in the senate. and i think to our credit. is go uo at least to the authorization of $6 million. we did  go above it. i can see for the life of me. what danger it would do. even if the bill the senator is talking about is going to be passed. and let us pray that it is. or who is being harmed. by increasing this paltry amount from $1.4 million to $6 million. i would say the answer is resoundingly "one." and yet there is a possibility that a lot of young people may be saved. and that is the whole purpose for the senate action. i hope the senator from kentucky recognizes this and withdraws his amendment.
 i k i can add to what my distinguished chairman has said. i said earlier in the day that. so far as funding by the federal government for cancer research is concerned. warren magnuson of washington state is certainly the father of that program. and i would  care to try to add to the eloquent -remarks so courageously spoken by my distinguished colleague from minnesota. senator muriel
 of the variety club of new england and executive director of the jimmy fund. bill came in contact with the famous and the celebrated. he was a close friend to many of bostons most hoed names. whether they played for the red sox or patrolled our streets as members of the massachusetts chiefs of police. he was immensely proud of the sox and they reciprocated. it was typical of both bill and the players that rare days off usually found them visiting a supermarket. shopping center. or knights of columbus hallanywhere bill koster could get across his humanitarian message. but it was  bill kosters desire to travel among the wellkn or familiar names. he was a man who knew that cancer respected station in life. and must be combatted in the trenches. on the streets. wherever two persons of good will could be persuaded that here was a cause that demanded their attention and support. the late cardinal cushing of boston called the jimmy fund the little mans charity. he was right. in a sense. but in aher way. bill kosters campaign made of little men great heroes. by enlisting them in a cause so -lose to gods heart. he lifted them above workaday worries and common crises. he gave them a touch of divinity. albeit demoratic divinity. we admired him for his tireless work. we loved him for his indomitable heart. we cherished him for his personal warmth and total lack of pretension. we shared his pride in his remarkable wife. rae. and in steven. the son who only recently joined the massachusetts bar. we k  that we. like they. have lost a remarkable fighter in the cause of human progress. we are made poorer by that loss. but we have more than our memories of bill to cling to in this sad hour. we have an example of courage and faith. we have a life ultimately triumphant. and an unfinished agenda that cries out for completion. we have it in our power to do the job that bill koster started. to support the work he made his own. to share in his crusade against cancer. we can move beyond words in the days ahead. we can support our sentiments with dollars. as americas doctors and researchers continue their vital research into the causes of cancer and possible cures. that would be a memorial better than stone. far better than mere eulogies. that is the message that bill kosters life compels. much as he will be missed we are grateful for what he started and what we will continue.
 to act if the hospitals do  work voluntarily. we can act ourselves. i just do  feel it is necessary to write it into this legislation. that is what i do  understand: why the necessity to have it included in this amendment.
s commission on mental health said are in need of strengthening. i was particularly pleased that the conferees restored most of the cut made in capitation grants for medical and other health professional schools. present loan and grant programs still are  an adequate substitute for this special institutional assistance whi:h must be continued. i also was glad the conferees agreed to the senate level of $7 million for traineeships to assist in the education of those who plan to work in the public health field. the conferees also agreed to the senate reduction of $265 million for medicaid to correct overestimating by the department. in addition. we cut the conference bill by a total of $1 billion to get control of fraud. abuse and waste in medicaid. public assistance. and other programs. we did  intend this cut to be only a "goal" as some may contend. we wrote strong conference report language directing the secretary of hew to specify to congress exactly how these savings will be achieved. if the administration fails to live up to this clear congressional directive. it will be held accountable for its failure. we mean business.
all i want to say to the distinguished chairman is this: everything the chairman said is correct. he ks as well as i do what we went through last year with some 20 votes and a conference which took 51/2 months on this issue. having gone through all that. it is  my intention. and i do  believe it is the chairmans intention. to let us retreat on this question of medicaid abortions. we are  trying to move forwardwhich i would like to do and which i think the chairman would like to do. we were  satisfied with the language of last years compromise. but certainly. we can afford to retreat any further than we did in 1978. we have  done it in the defense appropriations bill and we have  done it in the continuing resolution. all i would like to get from the chairman is assurance that if the house sends back to us any language which. in anyway. represents a retreat from last years position. we will then go back to the continuing resolution. that is what i put to the chairman most respectfully. because i think anything short of that. i just can agree with allowing this to be substituted.
. as the 95th congress draws to a close. i would like to call attention to one of the wisest investments which this congress. as preceding congresses. has made with the taxpayers money. and that investment is in the funds appropriated for medical and health research. as only one example of the great strides being made by our health research dollars. i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues an article in the may/june issue of quest magazine on the exciting. far reaching research being done on the chemistry of the brain by dr. jerry christian at the university of alabama in birmingham. research which provides most needed basic information on the physical or chemical causes of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and stress. some of the most dramatic breakthroughs in medical research in the last decade or so has come in such research on the physical or chemical causes and treatment of mental illness. and the fruits of such research have provided a welcome and necessary complement to doctors existing kledge about and methods of caring for the mentally ill. i hope that the national institute of mental health will  only continue but will expand its support of research such as dr. christians. i submit the article for printing in the recoa. in closing. i would like to e that i am especially pleased to call attention to this most progressive medical research being done at the medical school at the university of alabama. for the national institutes of health and our nations medical research programs owe much of their very existence and support to the vision. dedication. and leadership of our most esteemed former colleague. senator lister hill of alabama. former chairman of what is  the human resources committee which has jurisdiction over our nations health and medical research programs. and former chairman of the laborhealth. education. and welfare appropriations subcommittee. on which i  have the ho to serve as ranking miity member. senator hills much hoed work on behalf of the national institutes of health as well as his and his familys longtime support of the medical school of the university of alabama. one of the nations leading medical centers. surely needs further tribute from us. but i am sure that i express the best wishes and appreciation  only of his contemporary colleagues but those of us who are hoed to carry on his work by wishing him well as one of the last---and the most unanimousactions of the senate in the 95th congress. the article referred to follows: a cvssacal coa ro maunrss. (by jo durdensmlith) on the ninth floor of the shiny neurosciences building at the university of alabama in birmingham. terry christian is looking for schizophrenia and stress. but  in the talk of patients or of businessmen. in graphs. the output of a gas chromatograph. they lie around him in huge swaths. a thin blue line eating up the paper. the line rises and falls. rises and falls. charting trace chemicals in batches of spinal fluid and brain tissue he has prepared for analysis. and each time it peaks at a particular interval. it shows that a substance called dimethyltryptamine (dmt) is present. its like looking for a drop of oil in a lake or for a bottle with a message in it in the atlantic. so small is the amount involved. but whenever dmt is translated out from the background "se" of its metabolites. christian believes. it means that the brain is making its own hallucien. perhaps this has to do with dreaming. perhaps it has to do with visions of madness. perhaps it has to do with the tensions and anxieties that stress makes for. all christian ks is that dmt is there. in rats. in patients awalting surgery. and in a percentage of schizophrenics. what does it mean. and where in the brain and the nervous system does dmt operate. "new techogies produce new kledge." christian says in a careful southern accent. as he looks up from the reams of paper and reaches for his pipe. hes a neat man. a west virginian. conservatively dressed. conservatively bearded. but theres an anxious drive in his talk that matches the lines in his forehead. "it had been suggested for a number of years that this thing was in the brain. chemically. its a derivative of tryptophan. an amiacid thats in virtually every food. but one could find it. they could find tryptamine. one of its precursors. and in the test tube they could make dm4t out of tryptamine. but they couldnt find dmt itself. there wasnt egh of it there. so we thought about this. and a group of us hererichard morin. frederick bonington. and myself---developed a special electroncapture gas chromatography technique that allowed us to look for much smaller concentrations than had been possible before: up to one part in a trillion. and we found it. just as had been predicted." he stabs at the graph peaks with his pipe. "dmt. a drug you could buy on street corners in the sixties. in the brain." ten years ago. dmt was kn as "the businessmans trip." it did  pass from the blood into the brain as well as lsd. so it did  last as long or have as pronced an effect. timothy leary studied it. in the early days. as a harvard researcher. and it was one of the drugs investigated by the various programs the government later poured money into as a result of societys general anxiety about addiction and the recreational high. terry christian. like many other young scientists. was a beneficiary of this new funding. after graduate studies in neurosciences at the university of tennessee and postdoctoral research at the university of kentucky. he joined the u.s. drug addiction center in lexington. kentucky to work on lsd and the brains messenger chemicals. and by the time--as an associate professor of neurosciences in birminghamhe established dmts presence in the brain. he had picked up egh interdisciplinary kledge about the complex workings of the brains communication system to be able to take his work beyond simple measurement. first. he showed that dmt was  just an accidental byproduct of the workings of the nerve cells. but integral to the way they interacted with each other. and then he and his group set about the task of finding out what role dmt played in the delicate chemistry of mood and sensation. "at the time. i was reading a book on brainwashing during the korean war." he says. leaning back from his cluttered desk. "and it mentioned a curious thing that happened to people being brainwashed. if they were put under sufficient stress for a sufficient period of time. they would start having florid hallucinations and would escape from reality. they would just say: im  here. . what causes this. i thoughtwhat candidate would you pick. i picked dmt." the next step was to work with human beings under stress. something thats possible only in hospital complexes like the university of alabama medical center. christian could . of course. look directly into the contents of his subjects brains. but he reckoned that what was in the brain would also be in spinal fluid. so he took spinal fluid from three- groups: a neurological laboratory control group. a group of schizophrenics. and a group of patients about to undergo surgery. and what he found. using the technique he and his colleagues had refined. seemed to bear out the idea hed got from the brainwashing book. dmt levels in the patients facing imminent surgical operations were way up beyond those of the control group. suggesting a connection between dmt and stress. and dmt in a proportion of the schizophrenics (which was what i expected. we k that schizophrenia is  a single disease") was also extremely high. suggesting a connection between stress. genetic predisposition. and madness. subsequent work with rats confirmed some of these suppositions. when the rats were subjected to extreme stress. the amount of dmt went up in their brains too. and their behavior became obsessive. random. "mad." the theoretical implications were. and are. staggering. "you see. what were really talking about." says christian. "is the chemical brain. the chemical basis of madness. stress. dreaming. imagination. sleep. pleasure. and so on. for years weve been dishing out drugs without really understanding what they do. weve been anesthetizing people we call crazy and tinkering with their behavior. and  were just beginning to see that this makes sense. these things are organic processes. they are organically correctable. even if the original cause of the disorder was  organic. take dmt. for example. its just one of a myriad of chemicals in the brain. and yet a breakdown in its distribution and control seems to have something to do with stress--and therefore with ulcers and alcoholismas well as schizophrenia. just understanding this one chemical and its pathways may give us a method of measuring and reducing stress. the quintessential 20thcentury disease. it may give us a way to bring people back from certain kinds of madness. it may help clear out some of the back wards of mental hospitals. but what about the rest of the brain. what about all the other neuronal systems that scientists are working on. i mean. were just scratching the surface. were just learning how to crawl. but already the new techniques we have are giving us a whole new perception of the body and its ailments. theyre suggesting radically new approaches to addiction and insanity. and theyre leading us toward a whole new family of drugs: addictive painkillers. antipsychotic drugs. and even. perhaps. drugs to regulate pleasure and sexual function." terry christian. 40. married. with three children. is just one of the people researching dmt in the united states. and just one of the people working in the burgeoning field of neurochemistry. last ember. 4.000 neuroscientists held a conference near disneyland in california--the biggest convocation of brain specialists ever gathered. they read a total of 1.900 papers to one aher. each reendorsing the collective view that the "chemical" brain had replaced other descriptive models of the brains working. as christian suggests. freuds hydraulic modelimpulses and instincts dammed up in one room will always come squirting up in aherwas antiquated. victorian. and all the other modelsthe telephoneswitching system. the analog computer. the holographwere just brave little metaphors borrowed from the latest available techogy. chemistry was the answer. chemical techniques already were opening up the brain for mapping. showing where the seats of sleep. emotion. and the bodys sense of time were. they were tracing the roots of madness and of pain. and soon they would take the place of the mysteries of the psychiatric confessional in explaining and correcting the dysfunctions of the mind. the story of the revolutionary new advances in neurochemistry began. like terry christians career as a research scientist. more than 10 years ago. when the u.s. government set up its extensive addiction and drugabuse programs in the midsixties. it wanted to rehabilitate addicts. to find addictive narcotics. and to understand why some people got hooked and some people didnt. but it also wanted to k what happened when drugs like heroin and lsd entered the brain and the neuronal pathways to it. in the absence of this basic kledge. addiction would remain an enigma. a large number of biochemists. medical chemists. and pharmacologists. then. were drawn into brain research and the neurosciences. partly because there was  money and opportunity in the field. and partly because they saw the drugs to be studied as emously powerful tools for probing brain mechanisms. about which little or hing was kn. etorphine. for example. one of the most potent drugs kn to manmore powerful than lsd and as much as 10.000 times more powerful than heroinwas effective in tiny amounts. and this suggested that whatever was happening was highly specific. other drugs had proncedly different effects. perhaps they could each be tracked down to precise events in the brain and the nervous system. thereby revealing a geography of pain. hallucination. and feeling. the scientists worked mainly with spinal and wholebrain preparations from animals. (the techogy did  allow more exact pinpointing.) even so. by the early seventies they had developed a rough picture of how psychoactive drugs and narcotics worked. they appeared to home in on the synapses. specialized regions (see box on page 34) where the terminal of a nerve cell fiber makes a junction with other nerve cells and communicates with them via messenger chemicals called neurotransmitters. the drugs and narcotics seemed to bind there to what are kn as receptor siteslarge molecules that float on the surface of the bodys nerve cells and lock on to naturally occurring substances. like hormones. which cause different chemical instructions to be sent to their various internal machineries. what the drugs and narcotics did was break into the nerve cells lines of communication. subverting their mal signaling processes. and they seemed to do this. in exactly the same way. in every vertebrate system studied from hagfish to humans. why. though. was their invasion so effective. and why were the narcosis. hallucinations. and addiction they caused so extreme. the next step was to find out the exact nature of the receptor sites: did these drugs have their own receptors. or did they merely have an accidental. partial affinity for receptors involved in routine nerve cell interaction. in 1973. the answer came. three groups. ably that of solomon snyder and candace pert at johns hopkins university. identified the first receptor sites for the opiates. and they did . in fact. match any of the sites then kn to mediate mal nerve cell interactions. the discovery of the opiates receptor sites made it much easier to establish what parts of drug molecules were responsible for what physiological effects. and because the rule seemed to be. the stronger the drug. the greater its affinity for the receptor sites. it became simpler and less expensive to test drugs for their analgesic and other potentials. this could  be done in the test tube. with purified receptors. scientists longer had to rely on prolonged testing with animals and humans. the pharmaceutical companies were enthusiastic. the work. though. also raised some extremely important questions. for man was  made with morphine inside him.  valium.  lsd.  any of the other chemicals being studied. why. then. should they fit. like key into lock. onto perfectly designed receptor sites at the synapses. just where the receptor sites for the bodys own neurotransmitters were. did it mean that the body produced natural painkillers. opiates. and halluciens. unchanged through evolution and similar in some part of their chemical structure to the drugs being investigated. did it mean that ancient organic substances were being displaced from their mal chemical pathways by laboratorymade equivalents. if the answer to the questions was yes. two fascinating implications followed. first. it might be possible to manufacture genuinely addictive drugs that already existed in the body in small quantities. and second. it might be possible to find the biochemical basis of dreaming. shock. natural anagest% and mental disorder. catatonic schizophrenia. for example. might be caused by overproduction of the bodys morphinelike substance. hallucination and dreaming might be caused by an lsdlike substance. terry christian had long studied both lsd and the binding sites for two of the kn neurotransmitters--dopamine and serotonin.  he began his search for dmt. which seemed to be the best candidate for the bodys own hallucien. elsewhere. spurred by rapidly improving methods for detecting tiny quantities of peptides in the brain. scientists feverishly looked for natural analogs of morphine and heroin. then came the breakthrough theyd all been waiting for. two british scientists at the university of aberdeen. john hughes and hans kosterlitz. had worked for years on electrical contractions of involuntary muscle in mice and guinea pigs. and theyd found--as had solomon snyders groupthat these contractions were interfered with both by opiates and by extracts of brain tissue. finally. in 1975. they succeeded in isolating from the tissue two related substances that were responsible for the opiatelike effect. they called them enkephailne (greek: "in the brain"). almost immediately. choh hao li. a researcher at the university of california. iced that the published structure of the enkephalins was almost exactly like a word in the chemical sentence of a substance hed got from camel pituitaries a decade before.  he called his fragment beta endorphln (for endoges morphine) and found that it had about 30 times the potency of morphine when injected into the brains of mice and rats. (this perhaps explains the camels extraordinary imperviousness to pain.) later. beta endorphin was found in pigs by a group at the salk institute. and later still two other substances. alpha endorphin and gamma endorphin. were also found. both of them similar to word sequences in the camelpituitary sentence. one had a tranquilizing effect in rats. the other made them irritable and violent. in the past two years. work on these natural modifiers of pain and mood and madness has gone forward at an astonishing speed. half a dozen endorphins. as well as the two enkephalins. have  been discovered. and the number of kn neurotransmitters. each of them drops in the sea of the brain. has risen from a single figure to more than 20. led by richard squires of the ferrosan laboratories and claus braestrup of the st. hans mental hospital (both in denmark). the search is on too for the bodys versions of benzodiazepines (the mi tranquilizers librium. valium. and tranxene). all this has been made possible by the new. ultrasensitive techniques in gas chromatography. "new techogies produce new kledge." as christian says. an advance in techogy .has also made it possible to find out exactly where in the brain these substances operate. by tacking a radioactive atom or a chemical marker onto the molecule of an endorphin. a neurotransmltters. or a drug. scientists  can track the molecules pathway in the brain and pinpoint its area of influence with remarkable accuracy. something they could  do before. thus the enkephalins. which seem to be neurotransmitters. are confined to the limbic system in the brainlinked in man to pain. moods. and emotionsand to the older. evolved pathway to it. antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine seem to compete with the neurotransmitter dopamine in the same area. and the endorphins seem to play a painmodifying role in the pituitary gland. the conductor of the bodys chemical orchestra. a third group of experiments has concentrated on what these substances do. and here the results have been truly extraordinary. in sweden. researchers gave patients with auditory hallucinations antiopiates to interfere with the bodys own opiateproducing processesand saw the hallucinations end within minutes. in israel. a scientist demonstrated that. at just over mal levels. a brain protein could produce epileptic convulsions. just below. it conferred feelings of pleasure and gratification. and in the united states. there are reports from new york of depressives and parad schizophrenics temporarily released from the prison of their diseases. and from wyeth laboratories of rats excited by their own brain chemicals. such results make neurochemistrys current advances both extremely exciting and somewhat scary. brain scientists  can find answers to the five basic questions of research: "is it there." "what is it." "what is its structure." "where does it operate." "what effect does it have." they are primed for a broadfront assault on the workings of the chemical brain. they can take a drug with kn psychological and physiological effects (seconal. dexedrine. librium. haldol. lsd: antlpsychotic drugs. mood modifiers. opiates. and halluciens). and by tracing it in the brain they can make an anatomical map of the functions it alters. they can. in autopsies. compare the brains of schizophrenics with those of mal patients and so locate and define the chemical disorders at the root of their madness. they can begin to elucidate the bases of hysteria. shock. epilepsy. sexual pleasure. sleep. dreaming. perhaps even imagination and memory. but inevitably. in the very process of understanding and correcting these things. they will alter the way we see ourselves and the way we live our lives. the drugs they produce are likely to be as revolutionary in the treatment of mental disease as antibiotics once were in the treatment of physical disease. and the pharmaceutical companies are working hard in this area: burroughs wellcome. as a result of work done in britain and the united states. has already produced a laboratory variant of enkephalln 100 times more powerful than morphine. but the techogy and understanding necessary to create beneficial drugs will make it possible to regulate the activities of a mal brain: all the processes and emotions integral to what we call personalitygratification. the sex drive. memory. intelligence. and so on. ultimately. the work of neurochemists will have social and political dimensions. terry christian is aware of this. hes standing over a dissecting microscope. cutting out of the small mass of a rat brain an even smaller part of it. the limbic system. with radiolabeled dmt soon available. hes on his way to finding out exactly where in the nervous system dmt plays its part in stress and perhaps schizophrenia. "of course ive thought about it." he says. flick. cut. lift. the heads of five other rats lie nearby. "a pill or injection to cure catatonla. hallucinations. and the effects of stress. a pill or injection for dreaming or sex. a pleasure pill.... but our first responsibility has got to be the sick in this society. something like one in every three hospital beds in the u.s. has a mental patient in it. between 30 and 40 million americans have diagable mental disturbances. and mental health costs us $17 billion a year. "then there are all the stressrelated diseases. we just dont k how to help people who suffer from these things. were quite good at antidepressant drugs. though we dont k how they work. but were good at antipsychotic drugs. the only effective one we have. chlorpromazine. was discovered by accident (they thought it was an antihistamine). the others have bad side effects. so all we can really do is give people stuff to keep them quiet. its unbelievably primitive. i mean. theres still this mystique about brain disease. about madness. its a throwback to ancient times. people say: this guy is crazy. stay away from him. its  an organic disease. hes just crazy. but it is organic. it has to be organic. theres hing up there but organic matter." he moves back to the microscope. a small scalpel in his hand. "even freud. who did a terrible disservice to chemistry. said so." the rat brains sectioned and put into isotonic sucrose for eventual analysis. we walk back to christians office. its piled with books. papers. articles. and graphs. emblematic of the urgency scientists like christian feel when their field becomes a hot one. there is so much to be done. there is dmt to be looked for in the mesolimbic system (the possible seat of schizophrenia) and in the visual cortex (hallucination). there is its relation to the dopamine receptors (which seem to play an important part in schizophrenia) to be analyzed. there is the effect the antipsychotic drugs may have on its production to be assessed. with the best equipment and proper funding. christian believes that this would take two years. as it s. it will take four or five. as head of the neurochemistry section of the neurosciences program. christian operates on a budget of little more than $35.000 a year. and this raises an important point. we are at what christian and other scientists call "the newest frontier." a new generation of opiates and mood drugs (to be used or abused as future generations see fit). a new control over mental disorder. a new explanation for (and perhaps control over) the activities central to our functioning as human beings--these things seem assured. and yet. the world of mental illness is ruled by the conventional wisdom of psychiatry. by. as the saying goes. "m.ds.  phda." and  egh money is available for this kind of brain research. "the fact is." says christian. packing his pipe and clearing a space on his desk. "the national institute of mental health. and the brain research section inside it. is a poor stepchild. were at the low end of the totem pole in terms of funding. what little money there is goes. in large part. to the m.d.s. which means that. as more and more people come into the brain research field. fewer and fewer applications for grants can be met. and more and more scientists are drawn into the pharmaceutical companies. which have slightly different priorities. and its time to change this. theres got to be a national program for mental illnesspretisely the kind of effort that was launched in the sixties to deal with addiction. there should be a proper center in the united states for research into schizophrenia. at the moment there just isnt one. theres a center for alcohol. theres a center for drug abuse. but were talking about a much bigger problem--stress. madness. things that eat into the fabric of our societybut things we k with proper funding we can eventually cure."*
. one of the most pressing problems confronting our society is what to do about escalating health care costs and how to improve our health care delivery system. the congress has before it sweeping proposals for revamping medical services. our colleague. the senior senator from maryland. mr. mathias. made a searching examination of the problems confronting the medical profession in a talk he gave at the dedication of new facilities at the university of california. san diego school of medicine. he used the occasion to lay down a challenge to the academic medical community to "join in a productive collaboration with those of us in government who feel strongly about these problems and who wish to solve them with fairness to all."
. who used his influence in trying to help us on one phase of this problem. i am  prepared to accept the suggestion of secession at the moment. but i am afraid some of our people may be prepared to take drastic action if something constructive is  done soon. i suggested yesterday that whenever and wherever there has been a tragedy in aher part of the country the people of the theast have been quick to respond. if. as the result of a tornado. an explosion. or a flood. people were without food. clothing. medicine. or shelter. every instinct of the people of the th prompted immediate remedial action. i am sure you will understand why they are becoming a bit more than impatient when. having been without necessary fuel. their health and comfort have been endangered. and their work has been threatened. and it seems to take such a long time to obtain any effective response. please understand that there is disposition to blame the people of other sections of the country. we do  need and do  ask for charity. we do ask for better judgment and the exercise of common sense on the part of those having the power to see that the situation is relieved in the theast.
let me make a suggestion. i agree that to try to write legislation on the floor is always dangerous. but as i said. some time ago i submitted this proposal to the chairman of each of the appropriations subcommittees so that the thing could be handled consistently. unfortunately. however. i was  able to get it prepared soon egh to get it before this subcommittee or the subcommittee considering the war department civil functions bill which also will come up this week. i would suggest that by our action here this aftern we should place the burden on the public health service to prove its contention before the committee on appropriations that they have a good case and that there ought to be an exception in the case of hospitals in certain districts. then the appropriations committee can act after a consideration of all the factors in a given situation. i would go along and try to help the gentleman work out such a procedure.
i think the gentleman has explained exactly what the situation is. had i realized that the amendment could be so interpreted. i would have tried to strengthen it. i do  feel that even the hospital in my district should use oil unless they k where they are going to get their supply with reasonable certainty.
. i shall  take anything like 30 minutes and hope i can finish in 3 or 4 minutes. i simply want to express my regret again that we did  this aftern take protective action lgainst. unnecessary waste of heating oil anywhere in this country. it seems crystal clear to me that a gallon saved anywhere becomes a gallon available elsewhere. i recognize. however. the fears of those who do have the oil in ample supply that we might have been going too far. and i want to say that. after having discussed the matter with some of my colleagues from texas and oklahoma. i propose to redraft the amendment so that it will be confined.exclusively to some 24 states which are  in trouble. have been in trouble. and probably will be in trouble again next winter. with reference to the presentation of these amendments to the committee of the whole house i feel compelled to continue to do so. there has been some criticism about presenting the amendments on the floor and the suggestion made that they more properly should be placed before the committee after full hearings. obviously it is utterly impossible for a member of congress who is  a member of the appropriations committee to do that. i have tried however. to substitute a procedure of communications to the chairmen of subcommittees prior to the conclusion of their hearings when bills are reported out without such a restriction in them. it seems to me that in fairness at least to my constituents and to the constituents of other members who are affected by this problem i should present an amendment on the floor for the consideration of the committee. if the committee sees fit to reject the suggestion that is their entire privilege. if they approve it. as did the committees under the chairmanship of the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from massachusetts . i think they set a fine precedent which other committees might well follow. however. if a committee declines to accept the responsibility. undoubtedly the house will  force it upon them. all that can be done is to make the record clear that the opportunity was created and that the committee refused to accept the responsibility. i am glad that when we are faced with further shortages. as we certainly will be. one will be able to charge the members of the subcommittees on independent offices and deficiencies with any responsibility. so far as the other two appropriation bills are concerned. i can imagine that the agencies involved can well interpret the debate and the vote as an open invitation to convert to oil as much as possible and to install oilburner equipment to the limit. if that is the result. the owners of heating units in homes. hospitals. churches. schools. industries. transportation systems. and other like groups. will find themselves facing tough competition for scarce and highpriced heating oils next winter. and the farmers. dependent upon other oils and gasoline from the rockies east. as well as in the south. are going to have the same kind of competition with their own federal government. which has given so much free advice to. everyone else about the need for conservation. i could understand resistance to the idea of federal conservation. if it came from those who want to continue these shortages to keep these skyrocketing prices frozen or who want to build a false claim of justification for aher increase. but i have yet to hear a federal official who has  expressed a profound concern about the increased cost of living. one might comment that actions speak louder than words or by their deeds you shall k them. in connection with the bill which will be before us next week. the laborsocial security bill. i would like to read from a letter which points out clearly the type of thing that has happened. the type of thing that could happen again. and the type of thing that i predict will happen unless this house is willing to act affirmatively in prohibiting it. this is a letter from otis l. anderson. medical director. chief. hospital division of the federal security agency. it reads as follows:
i thank the chairman. i certainly will  offer the amendment. i personally regret deeply that the gentleman from illis is leaving us. it is a personal loss to me. and i k it is a loss to all of the members of the house. i wish him every success in recovering his health as well as success in any activity which he chooses to take up. i hope it will mean that he will be back with us before long. i am sure he ks that as long as a single colleague of his remains in this house. he will find a cordial welcome whenever he comes to see us. i hope that will be very frequently.
ccmmittee on interstate and foreign commerce. h. r. 6339. a bill to amend the provisions of title vi of. the public health service act relating to standards of maintenance and operation for hospitals receiving aid under that title. without amendment (rept  1939). referred to the committee of the whole house on the state of the union.
i thoroughly understand the gentlemans concern with the elimination of that language. may i suggest to him that if you put that language back in again you will nullify the effect of the amendment i offered. i call your attention to the fifth report of the presidents scientific research board. and its recommendations on policies. i think this is exactly the sort of procedure that should be conducted. it is entitled "balancing research." it calls attention to the fact that onefourth of all medical research projects in all agencies are in determining etiology. it then goes on further to discuss every specific research program. then it makes this recommendation: to the extent permitted by law. the agencies of the government should move promptly to correct this imbalance. because the research work of the public health service is  directed to the medical problems of special population groups and because that agency has been charged by the congress with responsibility for the health of the whole population. it should direct increased research effort to those diseases and impairments which are  receiving insufficient attention but which are major causes of death and disability. i submit to the gentleman that with that type of a policy. king that we are ranging all over this field and perhaps placing too much emphasis on one thing and too little on aher. we should give this foundation power to examine the programs that they are undertaking. these people who are working in that field. and then tell us where the better emphasis could be made. and where we will get a sounder program. but. i think if you put that language back in you would. in effect. say. "dont you even look at aher agencys program."
. i am very glad to report to the membership on two developments in connection with the distribution of food commodities in massachusetts. first. the area director in massachusetts. mr. john c. stalker. upon receipt of the evidence i sent to him of the comparative studies of consumption of potatoes made in buffalo. n. y.. by the bureau of human nutrition and home ecoics. united states department of agriculture. winter of 1948. requested the revision upward of the amounts which could be allotted to each person per week and has obtained authorization to exercise discretion in any upward revision. then he set up a rate of distribution which did  quite reach the recommendations i made based on the buffalo study but which does. as he indicates. provide almost twice as many potatoes as those under the existing maximum amount by the order of the food distribution programs branch. united states department of agriculture. effective july 1. 1949. i  quote the letter:
it is my understanding that the fort devens hospital is what you call a station hospital. it has nursery. consequently. the benefits to the dependents of servicemen will be cut off entirely. i think i am stating the facts in connection with it.
it is a fact that in 1952 the medical bills in this country ran to $9.400.000.000. that includes hospital and doctors. dentists. nurses. and medicines. of that $9.400.000.000 only $1.600.000.000or 17 percentwas covered by any insurance at all.
in the first place. i want to say very frankly that i have the highest respect and regard for the gentleman. i k he is stating with great sincerity his own deep convictions on this matter. he has discussed the subject with me. he made a statement to me over the last weekend which i think should be in this record. he said that this is an experiment. that the department recognizes it. the committee recognizes it. the congress will recognize it. and that the president has recognized it as an experiment. but that we will never k whether it will work unless we give it an opportunity. i am delighted that the gentleman is joining the committee this aftern in support of the bill. there is just one more point. if i may. the gentleman from new york i thought misunderstood me when i made a statement as to the extent of the 1952 medical bill of the country. and the amount of insurance involved. it has never been my contention. and i k one who has contended. that the passage of this bill will reduce medical bills directly. but i think the gentleman will agree with me that if this program does become a success. if there is a wider coverage and a better coverage. it will reduce the direct impact on the individual and transfer it to the voluntary insurance companies.
but i do say that it ought to and i hope will make for better coverage for more people. consequently. instead of having to pay out of their own pockets. they can be reimbursed through added health insurance.
may i say to my dear friend and colleague that if we can this aftern take the initial step toward providing better health protection for the american people. then i would hope to see the gentlemen walking shoulder to shoulder with us in an attempt to make that better health protection available.
that is exactly correct. may i point out that we have only 12 percent of the chronicdisease beds we need. the $35 million requested is to implement the provisions of public law 482 approved july 12. 1954. the request. which is $25 million less than the law authorizes. would provide $10 million for chronicdisease facilities and $5 million for nursing homes. these two types of facilities are considerably less expensive to construct than general hospitals and can provide patient care at approximately onethird the cost of patient care per day which must  be given in more expensive general hospitals. it would free more general beds for patients with acute illness and permit more urgently needed facilities for chronic patients  in need of a full hospital regime. ten million dollars for diagtic and treatment facilities to care for ambulatory patients. by emphasizing preventive medicine and care of the ambulant patient. the demands for general hospital beds will be reduced and the total cost to the patient will be less than the cost of hospitalization. this type of facility providing earlier diagis would prevent chronic illness and subsequent longterm hospitalization with its tremendous expenditure to the individual. ten million dollars for rehabilitation facilities. from an ecoic standpoint alone the return in taxes paid by rehabilitants is estimated to exceed the cost of rehabilitation. the 83d congress has passed a bill to expand the number of patients rehabilitated. there is  a great shortage of adequate rehabilitation facilities for both patient care and training purposes. the report by the house appropriations committee indicates that the committee is in sympathy with the new program but fearful that more harm than good will be accomplished by proceeding before any but the most sketchy plans are available. this statement completely overlooks the fact that at time in the program are construction grant funds approved for expenditure without a comprehensive survey by the state. and approval by the surgeon general of the state plans required under the survey and planning phase. the house committee based its refusal to approve this item on alleged vagueness of the program presented. however. it must be stressed that many states will complete the survey and planning phase of the program and be ready to embark upon the construction portion of the program during fiscal year 1955. moreover. in the case of chronicdisease facilities. for which $10 million has been requested. all states could proceed almost immediately in view of the fact that this type of facility has been included under the original program and in the current state plans. although the funds are available for a 2year period the development of plans and the actual building construction in a community requires from 12 months to 24 months before the buildings are ready for occupancy. it was emphasized in the testimony that unless the $35 million was appropriated there would be a delay of a full year in launching the new program in view of extreme reluctance on the part of the states to undertake a new activity unless funds have been appropriated by the congress. in view of the record of uncertainty with respect to the amount of annual appropriations under the hospital survey and construction program it is  likely that the states would intensively launch upon the survey and planning activities with a mere authorization in the basic law for appropriations. the full amount of $35 million would be all encumbered by the end of the 2year period of availability on these grant funds. for fiscal year 1955. $850.000 was appropriated for salaries and expenses to administer a program of $75 million in grant funds for hospital construction. this was $25.000 less than was appropriated for fiscal year 1954 when the program was at the $65 million level and $350.000 less than fiscal year 1953 when the program was last at the $75 million level. mandatory salary increases will further reduce the level of finances for this item. the appropriation request of the president and the department for fiscal year 1955 for the $75 million program level was $950.000. under public law 482. 83d congress. effective july 12. 1954. in order to carry out the additional work incident to the new amendments to the hospital survey and construction program a sum of $400.000 was requested as essential. this sum for salaries and expenses was included with an appropriation request of $2 million for survey and planning grants and $35 million for specified construction grants. it is pointed out that regardless of whether or  federal funds are appropriated for construction grants to the states the public health service by the mandates of public law 482. 83d congress. must develop basic policies. procedures. forms. and instructions pertaining to the survey and planning activities of the states in order to assure the uniformity of procedures throughout the nation. in addition the provisions of public law 482. 83d congress. also require the public health service with the approval of the federal hospital cbuncil to develop and promulgate the necessary and essential regulations pertaining to the program covered by the new amendments. this entails an extensive work.load and in the interestof developing the best possible program. consultation. and assistance from federal groups with special kledge in the health field. some of these groups are the american medical association. the american hospital association. the nursing home and rehabilitation groups. the provisions of the new law provide a time limit of 6 months from date of enactmentjuly 12. 1954for the completion of the new regulations. an extensive educational program is essential in order to assure the establishment of the program called for in public law 482. 83d congress. on a firm and sound basis. it is impossible to absorb the increased workload under the regular program with the current staff which is smaller than last year and then. in addition. undertake any of the activities called for under the new program. if funds for construction grants are made available the additional $400.000 requested will permit an appropriate beginning of this phase of the new program.
the gentleman is correct about that. there is only $2 million in the bill and that is provided for survey and planning. there is  1 penny in the bill for recent commitment to the people in our the construction of any of the facilities. districts. if you want to see that. the if you want this excellent program serious deficit in health facilities is extended. if you want to carry out our overcome as soon as possible. you should support the presidents recommendation by voting for the amendment. i am  including for the record the tabulation to which i referred: table i.-summary of construction projects reported by state agencies to be eligible to share in federal funds appropriated under hillburton act. fiscal year 1955 ]source: state agency reports to the public health service.  an official schedule] estimatcd cost hospital beds added. by category other facilities (thousands) number of projects t cbcoc nursing federal total g eneral mental tuibeu- chronic puli honmsand adjunctfe ra losis disease health training facilities total share. center facilities 1965 total ------------------------- 669 41.436 31.398 4.533 1.863 13. 642 109 30 25 $cai. 673 $270. 082 alabama --------------------------- 13 355 355 ----------------------------------- -

in looking at the committee report on page 11. and on the top of page 12. reference is made there to new amendments to the hillburton act features. which have to do with hospital construction. probably that feature should be increased. i ice that the committee has increased the amount for hospital construction $75 million. but included $21 million for four new types of facilities. i do  find anything in the report although it may be in the hearings somewhere as to the division between the four categories.
 of the committee said during the course of his remarks. constitutes one of the major pieces of legislation we will enact at this session. second. i want to point out for the record. so there will  be any misapprehension. and i do  think anybody has referred to it. that the american medical association was represented before us through witnesses who heartily endorsed this particular legislation. so there is controversy on it from that point of view. thirdly. i want to read a brief excerpt from the report which struck me as i heard it as one of the most encouraging things that could be said in regard to handling this terrible problem of mental health. dr. daniel blain. medical director of the american psychiatric association. said: the despair that consigned the mentally ill to simple custody for life in mental institutions is rapidly being displaced by the realization that mental illness is  hopeless and that the great majority of the mentally ill can be treated and returned to the community in a relatively short period of time. aher most auspicious change in peoples thinking lies in the general trend toward deemphasizing the conventional mental hospital as an almost exclusive tool for dealing with mental illness. this has been in small measure due to the wisdom of the congress in encouraging the development of community clinic services under the national mental health act and through the veterans administration. increasingly. the mental hospital is thought of as merely part of a network of community services. all of them designed to forestall or prevent hospitalization if possible. and to shorten it if .
. i am delighted that the conferees have been able to submit to the house what i belive to be an excellent agreement in conference upon this very important legislation. i am convinced that it should and will provide the respective officials in the federal government. the several state governments and the local communities. working with the scientists and medical groups. a most practical means of developing a program worthy of the approval of the american people. in fact. having been associated with this effort as a member of the responsible subcommittee of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce and as a house conferee. i feel entirely confident that by the time congress reassembles. it will be recognized that this particular legislation is one of the outstanding accomplishments of this session of the 84th congress. so far as i am concerned. i also want to testify to the fact that. under the able leadership of the gentleman from tennessee . acting as chairman of the subcommittee and chairman of the full committee. there was  the slightest trace of partisanship or politics. rather. there was a clear recognition of the committees grave responsibility and a determined effort to present to the house the best possible legislation. if this federal contribution leads to a quicker and surer prevention and final elimination of poliomyelitis. all those who have had any part whatsoever in the effort will be amply rewarded. i want particularly to emphasize that in all her association with the subcommittee while it was trying to work out a satisfactory solution.  of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce. the gentleman from tennessee . the record is crystal clear as to his recognition of the importance of timely and intelligent action by congress following the anncement in april of the release of the first poliomyelitis vaccine developed for general use by dr. salk. his preparation of the committee program and the public record of the hearings held under his guidance prove beyond any question that he is entitled to and should receive the full credit for instituting an outstandingly intelligent and creative inquiry by the house committee. culminating today in this recommendation of final house action in this particular phase of the matter before us. i most sincerely and earnestly recommend its adoption by the house.
. i want to make the position i took in committee consideration of this bill clear. i can do so best by restating the additional views i filed with the committee report as follows: i did  vote to report this bill favorably. i am convinced that public law 377 of this congress. the poliomyelitis vaccination act of 1955. should be extended beyond the terminal date. february 15. 1956. but i am  convinced  that it should be extended to july 1. 1957. without more consideration of certain facts. since i have doubt that it will be extended to that date. i believe i should state briefly the matters i think should be considered further by the department. this committee. and congress prior to july 1. 1957. i k that this committee has every intention of continuing its interest in the administration of the program and i understand that reference will be made to that in the report. this committee and congress wisely set the present terminal date at february 15. 1956. so that this new and vitally important program would be reviewed early in this session. the secretary of health. education. and welfare recognized this in his letter transmitting the draft of this bill stating that it was the congressional intention "to provide an opportunity for reviewing program developments early in the second session of the congress before completely implementing the federal grant provisions of the act." the department reported its estimate that there would be sufficient vaccine available by december 31. 1956. to provide for 3 injections for each of the 65 million children under age 20 and expectant mothers. but added that this was based upon 100percent demand which it conceded was unlikely. it based its request for the extension to july 1. 1957. on the recommended 7month interval between second and third injections. it seems to me that this committee should have been given evidence of any departmental plans as to adjustments which should be made as soon as production of the vaccine permits. to make additional vaccinations in the older age groups possible. undoubtedly such adjustments will be made and i hope they will prove satisfactory to all concerned. however. without intending any reflection upon anyone. it seems to me that this committee should  be asked to approve a blanket extension of such duration in the absence of the most complete information available as to possibilities during that period. this committee recommended. and this congress accepted the recommendation. of an upper age limit of 19 years. with the addition of "any expectant mother." in the definitions under the actsection 10 (b) (1). and see also section 4. i believe that recommendation was sound. but i can accept the argument that it should necessarily be continued to june 30. 1957. it constitutes an important limitation and i hope it will be considered fully long before that date. last year this committee had before it the clear and sound warning that it would  discharge its full responsibilities by confining its thinking to the admittedly vital problem of prevention among those under 21 years of age. at its hearingspart 2. pages 134. 136. 137dr. albert b. sabin. of the childrens hospital research foundation. cincinnati. ohio. testified in part as follows: it is important to stress that this is longer a disease we should call infantile paralysis. because the disease occurs with great frequency in young adults and. furthermore. is much more severe in those in later life than in earlier years * 0 *. i submit. gentlemen. that these in the third decade (age 21 to 30) are just as much in need of preventive measures as are all the others * * *. to summarize this. then. the problem in the united states is to prevent paralysis in young adults in whom it is most severe. as well as in children in whom it is more frequent. last year. and mostly subsequent to the passage of this law. massachusetts suffered its worst epidemic of poliomyelitis. at the suggestion and with the financial assistance of the national foundation of infantile paralysis a special study was made. it appears that of 3.819 cases. there were 675 in the age groups between 10 and 20. however. there were 574 in the age groups from 20 to 30. 232 in the age groups from 30 to 35. and 104 in the age groups from 35 to 40. it is my recollection that a great many of the cases among the young adult groups were most severe. any instance of this disease is tragic. all who have contributed toward its prevention are richly entitled to the gratitude of this nation. but the responsibilities of this congress toward insuring the best possible program are great. i do  believe that they will be discharged completely by a simple extension of the date. for emphasis. i repeat my appreciation of and agreement with the contents of what i understand will be in the committee report on this point. in this connection. i also want to quote the paragraph in the committee report. to which i have referred. as follows: the highest incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis for the united states as a whole occurs in the age groups below 20 and in pregnant women. these are the groups which are eligible to receive vaccinations with funds authorized in the act. your committee is recommending change in this limitation at the present time. your committee has received information. however. which indicates that in some states the incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis and the severity of the cases is as great or greater in some age groups above 20 years. your committee trusts that the surgeon general and others responsible will review from time to time the voluntary national priority system  in effect in relation to experiences in the various states to determine whether the priority groups should be modified to ih*lude individuals in selected age groups above 20 years. and advise the congress of any corresponding changes in this legislation which might be desirable. therefore. i have every reason to believe that. irrespective of the extension of the expiration date of the poliomyelitis act of 1955 to july 1. 1957. the department. the surgeon general and others responsible will review the existing priority system and will keep in close touch with the committee as to all developments and as to any desirable modification. extension or other revision of that system. i k that the committee will continue its interest in guaranteeing that the program is sound in every respect. at this time. i think it advisable to e that congress undoubtedly will adjourn prior to august 13. 1956. and that there is  reason to expect that it will be in session again until the 85th congress convenes in january 1957. a suggestion has been made that there would only be egh vaccine to permit the vaccination of those under 20 and expectant mothers between  and july 1. 1957. that iges the fact that one can possibly k how many will qualify in those priority groups in that period. it iges the fact that the department conceded frankly that its estimate was based upon 100 percent demand which it felt was unlikely. and it iges the fact that the production possibilities are definitely estimates. there may be other important factors which the committee and congress would wish to consider sometime in the nearly 17 months ahead of us before the act would expire under this bill.
i have iced in the report that the committee says that "the proposed legislation does  contain any provision with regard to the present ratio of physicians to active duty personnel." however. it does go ahead to discuss that matter. and if i understand the report correctly it indicates that the committee is of the opinion that the present ratio of 3.2 to 1.000 should probably be increased to 3.4 in the air force. 3.4 in the army. and 3.7 in the navy. i have had considerable correspondence and some personal conferences with physicians and dentists who seem to feel rather strongly that the army. navy. and air force in particular have  sought to realistically appraise their needs. consequently there is a disposition on the part of responsible officers in those three departments to retain more positions than are needed. i have  been in a position to examine those allegations sufficiently to make any determination as to their accuracy. i do. however. have in mind that sometime in recent days the hoover commission did go into the problem and did make certain recommendations. as i understand it. those recommendations were perhaps  entirely acceptable to the armed services. 13 the gentleman in a position to advise us as to the question that i have raised. i think it is rather important because i think that the cost figure necessarily involves what the services will ask for and what they will expect to keep in the forces in terms of positions against the medical and dental personnel available to civilians in this country.
 asked the health resources advisory committee to explore all possible measures for keeping to a minimum the disruption of our civilian health needs. . i say that is a challenge to me i will  overlook. matter whether any member of the committee on armed services sees fit to tell me on the floor of this house that "i k we are going to pass this bill. so why are you asking any questions." as long as i have taken an oath of office here and as long as i am representing more than 300.000 people. amerioan citizens. who are entitled to my consideration. i will ask those questions as i think proper. and i can take all the ridicule that anyone sees fit to throw at me. i simply want to say.
it so happens that i have a considerable amount of shadegrown tobacco in my area. and it is a fact that because of the development of this homogenized wrapping tobacco they have undertaken a program of voluntary .cutback which is very substantial. i am  aware of what their position may be. but i hope it will be possible for the chairman of the committee and the gentleman to advise us tomorrow as to what the committees intentions are with reference to that particular crop.

. as a miity member of the subcommittee. i wish to join in the same request. when the matter originally came up for consideration. we merely had before us a report of the engineers. opposition was presented at the hearings by any member of the senate or by others. due particularly to the illness of the senior senator from th carolina. but on the further consideration by the full committee. both the senior senator from th carolina and representative doughton of th carolina. from the district immediately involved. asked for the adoption of the amendment  proposed. which amounts to a withdrawal of the committee proposal and provision for a further survey in that area. the committee was unanimous in approving- the adoption of the modified amendment.
. this is an extraordinary case. bringing into question the confirmation of the ination for reappointment to the office of commissioner of the district of columbia of a man who has served for 3 years in that office. and we are asked to confirm him in the face of a condemnatory report unanimously rendered by a subcommittee of the senate appointed to investigate the gallinger hospital. which hospital was primarily under his general jurisdiction as the commissioner assigned to that particular work. that report demonstrates that the ination should  be confirmed. the case goes back to the appointment of the subcommittee by the then chairman of the committee on the district of columbia. the senator from nevada . who asked the three senators who have just spoken to the senate to make an investigation. it seems to me that the senate owes to the senator from nevada and to those three senators an obligation to act upon their recommendations in the absence of controverting testimony of any kind. there has been controverting testimony to offset this charge of extraordinary administrative neglect. which in any other city. of this nation would bring about a change of administration by election of the people. that can be done in this city because the people have authority to vote on it. we are the only ones who can act. we can act by voting for confirmation or refusing confirmation of this appointive officer. who holds one of .the three chiefexecutive positions in the district of columbia. in this instance the investigating committee is one of outstanding and extraor.dinary competence for this particular .work. any city in america would be glad .to have the services of three such distinguished and experienced administrators in making such an investigation. the chairman of the subcommittee. the senator from oregon . who has just spoken. before he came to the senate served as a member. and chairman. of the multah county. oreg.. board of commissioners. which has charge of similar or larger institutions in that state. furthermore. for 8 years he was a member of the oregon state board of control. consisting of the gover. the secretary of state. and the state treasurer. this board had charge of the administration of all the state penal and eleemosynary institutions. with a population of more than 6.000 inmates. the senator from oregon. therefore. has had large experience of an administrative character in that field. the senator from south dakota [ of the subcommittee on appropriations dealing with the district of columbia. i
. i wish to refer to these important figures. for the past 3 years. the 3 years during which mr. mason has served as a member of the board of commissioners. the commissioners received. in appropriations under the final appropriation act. almost the same amount which they had requested. beginning with 1944. and using round figures. the commissioners asked for $1.401.000. they received $1.396.000. or $5.000 less. in 1943 the commissioners asked for $1.378.000. they received $1.381.000. or $3.000 more than they requested. in 1942. the first of the 3 years of mr. masons term. the commissioners asked for $1.333.000. they received $1.323.000. or only $10.000 less. going back of that period. in 1941. they asked for $1.006.000. they received $1.003.000. or $3.000 less. in 1940. they asked for $918.000. they received $899.000. or $19.000 less. in 1939. they asked for $825.000. they received $800.000. or $25.000 less. in 1938. they asked for $739.000. they received $743.000. or $4.000 more. in 1937 they asked for $705.000. they received $679.000. or $26.000 less. in 1936 they asked for $655.000. they received $631.000. or $24.000 less. it seems to me that that record is sufficient to indicate that there is justification for any statement by the commissioner that the failure to provide adequate funds is due to acts of congress rather than the recommendations of the commissioners with respect to this hospital. senators have heard the report of the subcommittee indicating the conditions in that hospital. which is a poor peoples hospital. it is the place in this community where people gq when they can afford to pay hospital bills. those people need defense from the senate. and the only way to cure serious administrative neglect is to change the administrator. it can be done by legislation. it can be done by putting in a new administrator. i believe it is vital that the senate have before it a statement of the material testimony of mr. mason before the subcommittee on this particular matter. i. therefore. take the time again to read to the senate these statements. which are the ones upon which i believe the senator from nevada based his emphatic recommendation. as set forth in the statement from him which i have just read. this hearing was on september 30. 1943. the senator from south dakota asked mr. mason: did you make any attempt yourself to investigate the charges made by the comptroller general.
i may say that in the substitute. as recommended by the committee. there are 14 points relative to bringing out aids to production at this time. it is upon those that we rely. the one the senator from minnesota has mentioned is one of them which will be included in the description of the bill. and it is of vital importance.
that was in the earlier form of the bill. the argument which impressed me the most when we were considering that earlier bill was along this line. which i do  think the senator has emphasized particularly : when we seek appropriations for a hospital in an industrial city we always obtain contributions from the chief industries of the city. the only industry in the city of washington is the united states government. therefore i have regarded the contribution made by the federal government as comparable to that made by industry for the benefit of its employees in the community. the district of columbia itself does  carry on much of an industry in the employment of people. but the united states government does carry on a tremendous activ ity. therefore. in that capacity. as the principal industry of the area. the federal government has a relationship to the proposed hospital comparable to that of manufacturing industries in their own communities. in the. latter case the relationship results in large contributions by local . industries to such community projects..
. i am indeed pleased to join the distinguished junior senator from maine and other senators on both sides of the aisle in sponsoring a bill to establish a permanent advisory commission on intergovernmental relations. identical bills have been introduced in the house of representatives by representative l. h. fountain. chairman of the intergovernmental relations subcommittee of the house government operations committee. and representative florence p. dwyer. the ranking miity member on the subcommittee. incidentally. representative dwyer is the occupant of the seat which i held for a number of years in the house. and which. after me. was held by my colleague. the distinguished junior senator from new jersey . for many years the need for continuing attention to the problems of intergovernmental relationships has been widely recognized. under our federal system the interrelation of federal. state. and local governmental units has presented. throughout our history. problems of great magnitude. the rapid growth of grantsinaid and other cooperative programs in recent decades has only served to increase the complexity of these problems. in an effort to evaluate and improve the numerous activities pertaining to intergovernmental relations. a number of excellent studies have been made in the past on the subject. ably by the first hoover commission and the wellkn commission on intergovernmental relations. more recently. the house committee on government operations completed an intensive 3year survey throughout the country drawing together information and suggestions from officials at all levels of government. as a result of these studies. both the hoover commission and the house committee on government operations have recommended the establishment of a continuing agency or commission on federalstate relations with primary responsibility for study. information. and guidance in this field. the bill which i am pleased to cosponsor today. as well as the identical bills already introduced in the house. is a direct outgrowth of this recommendation. in my opinion. the establishment of a permanent advisory commission on intergovernmental relations would be a significant step forward in the improvement of our federal system. our federal system can function properly if the states and their subdivisions lose -their will and capacity to cope with problems traditionally within their purview. by finding.better and more efficient methods of administering and controlling cooperative programs between the various levels of government. the proposed commission would do much to preserve the health of our states and to insure the continued vitality of our federal system.
. last week. on june 2. under secretary dillon received an hoary degree of doctor of law from columbia university. i would like to conclude my remarks by reading the citation for this hoary degree because it expresses so well the qualities that commend the inee to our approval: clarence douglas dillon is presented for the degree of doctor of law. history teaches us that a democratic society will be best safeguarded when men of uncommon ability make the deliberate choice to forsake private interests for the public service. you have made this choice and you deserve well of your country because you have brought to your great responsibilities intelligence. industry. and devotion. in a troubled time. you provide the priceless quality of quiet. distinguished leadership.
. i ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor of the resolution (s. res. 129) favoring continued efforts by all nations to strengthen cooperation in health and research activities. submitted by the senator from minnesota [mr. humphreyj on
. it is particularly gratifying when a leading american industrial organization furnishes proof of the excellence of its standards in operation. such a distinction has just been achieved by the esso standard division of humble oil & refining co.. as evidenced by an award of the special citation of the public health service. particularly eworthy is this recognition because esso received the award for the fourth time. and the third consecutive year. the special citation represents one of the governments top awards for excellence in sanitation. and was presented to john d. rogers. general manager of the esso standard division. by wesley e. gilbertson. chief. division of engineering services of the public health service. at a ceremony in the new york yacht club. new york city. on tuesday. mr. rogers. who. in addition to other important connections. is a member of the board of directors of the american merchant marine institute. has long since demonstrated his interest in elevating standards connected with the maritime industry. his fellow members of the esso standard division have combined their efforts successfully in achieving the most desired results. how well they have acquitted themselves is demonstrated by the fact that each of the 39 tankers of the esso standard division achieved a rating of 95 or higher on an official phs inspection involving 166 separate items of sanitary construction and maintenance. the previous citations to the esso standard division were awarded in september 1955. june 1958. and march 1959. tankers of esso call at all atlantic and gulf coast ports and at river ports along the mississippi and ohio rivers.
the table shows the kind of service that these registries are called upon to perform and do perform for the public. the point i wish to make in regard to this table particularly is the fact that these registries are called upon by hospitals. by individuals. and by doctors for far more nurses than they are able to supply. this is obviously a public service which is being rendered by these organizations. my amendment. as i point out. does  seek a permanent solution of this problem. but merely an interim solution. by providing an exemption to these organizations for years beginning before july 1. 1961. they are. or course. organized  for profit. and part of their earnings inures to any organization or any individual. if these organizations were  limited in their membership to individuals affiliated with a professional society. and if they were  principally supported by registration fees. and were  controlled by the registrants. but were operated by an independent. outside board of directors. they would probably be considered tax exempt. the point is that this is the way they are organized. to cut off their exemption would run the great risk of having the service rendered to the public as well as to the medical profession and hospitals of the country cut off while efforts were being made to readjust and reorganize the form of their organization and operation. since i am asking only for a temporary continuation of the exemption. i hope very much that the committee will find it possible to take the amendment to conference.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to direct the surgeon general to establish and publish criteria useful in indicating the harmful effects of various airpollution agents. this would help greatly to bring about an informed public understanding of the growing problem of air pollution. and would also add strength to the effort for its prevention and control. over the country there are some 175 state and local air sampling stations. in addition to the continuous air monitoring stations operated by the federal government in 9 major cities. the data they record flow into the robert a. taft sanitary engineering center. in cincinnati. an agency of the u.s. public health service. our critical need. however. is for readily available information on the effects of the various substances which are polluting our atmosphere. i believe that one of the reasons why relatively little effort is being made by many of our states to control air pollution is the existence of the largely unnecessary smog of public confusion and uncertainty about the meaning of airpollution levels. according to the washington post of february 7. the amount of sulfur dioxide in the air. as reported by the washington air monitoring station on february 6. reached the highest level since the station began to monitor air in washington. for 81/2 hours the sulfur dioxide measured more than 0.3 parts per million parts of air. what does this mean. does 0.3 part per million of sulfur dioxide in the air constitute a reasonably healthy level. perhaps merely imparting a bracing and vigorous tang to the air. or does this amount mean that we are close to the sort of disaster which claimed many lives in liege. belgium. in doa. pa.. and. on two occasions. in london. all of these tragedies involved. in part. at least. air pollution from the oxides of sulfur. as well as the weather phee kn as air inversion. in the absence of standards indicating the relative danger of various levels of sulfur dioxide pollution. the public has way of placing in perspective this air pollution reading. even with the most careful reporting of the immediately observable effects. such information may  even be possessed by health and airpollution officials. a conference on air pollution. open to the public. was held in the health. education. and welfare department auditorium the day following the record reading of sulfur dioxide here in washington. a public health service speaker at the conference was asked to explain the significance of 0.3 part per million of sulfur dioxide in the air. as recorded in washington. d.c.. on the previous day. he indicated he could  answer the question. because there were federal air pollution standards. and because he did  have at hand a copy of the california standards. california is the only state which has developed and published extensive airpollution standards. the following is an excerpt from a table entitled "california standards for ambient air quality." as amended by the california state board of public health on march 16. 1962. and as incorporated into the california administrative code. title 17. chapter 5. subehapter 5. article 1:
. i submit a senate concurrent resolution. on behalf of myself and the junior senator from connecticut . for appropriate reference. the concurrent resolution would express the sense of the senate and the house of representatives that the state of new york should raise its minimum legal drinking age from 18 to 21. this would make the same minimum drinking age effective in the five states and canada which border on new york. the concurrent resolution was submitted earlier in the house of representatives by congresswoman florence p. dwyer. i am hoed by the cosponsorship of senator ribicoff. the former gover of connecticut and a leader in national highway safety. i ask that the resolution be printed at this point in the record.
. residents of new jersey have long been concerned about the unusual situation in the neighboring state of new york. which permits youngsters in the age bracket of 18 to 21 to buy drinks freely. this unsupervised and unrestricted drinking of alcoholic beverages by teenagers. in public and private. has resulted in a variety of harmful activities. including reckless and drunken driving. assaults upon persons and property. and other forms of delinquency. it is heartening to many of us that goy. nelson rockefeller. of new york. last week said that he would approve a bill to raise new yorks minimum drinking age from 18 to 21. should the new york state legislature pass such a bill. the new york state legislature is in session currently. and i am hopeful that the anncement by the gover. added to the fact that the majority party in the new york state legislature has a platform plank which supports such legislation. will result in finally ending this difficult and dangerous situation. numerous public officials and publications have pointed to the need for such legislative action. and i am hopeful that the adoption of a concurrent resolution in the house of representatives and the senate of the united states will expedite action by our friends in new york state. as congresswoman dwyer has pointed out. in new jersey alone during the 7year period of 1955 through 1961. there were 27 accidents. 33 fatalities and 55 injuries resulting directly from the drinking of alcoholic beverages in new york by new jersey drivers under 21 years of age. since then. the rate has nearly doubled. in the 3year period from 1962 through 1964 there were 19 accidents. 24 deaths. and 33 injuries from the same cause. dramatic facts such as these underscore the need for prompt and effective action. and i am grateful to senator ribicoff for joining with me in this bipartisan effort. we shall do everything we can to bring an end to this unwholesome situation.
. i am happy to join with my colleagues from new york and several other states in sponsorship of this legislation to advance our battle against the tragedy of narcotics addiction. far too many of our citizens are the victims of this terrible fate. far too much time has passed without the achievement of lasting results in the campaign against this ageold affliction. it is my belief that if these bills can be enacted we can make important strides in the direction of returning thousands of addicts to mal. useful lives. i am particularly pleased that these measures have recognized the work being done by private. profit organizations in the field of treatment. by providing these organizations with working capital to continue and improve their efforts we will be assured of both balance and additional strength in this good fight. but i would emphasize that treatment is  the last step in the rehabilitation of the narcotics addict. the type and quality of aftercare are crucial. here we have something less than a spectacular record. according to available estimates the relapse rate of drug addicts has ranged up to 90 percent. the chief problem seems to be in the addicts difficulty. after release from a hospital or rehabilitation center. in making a successful adjustment to his social environment. one of the important purposes of our legislation is to deal with this particular phase of the problem and it is my hope that the committees which take up these bills will give it the most careful attention.
 of the new jersey pharmaceutical association has been quoted as saying: some drug poisoning is a result of mistaken overdosing. but a great deal of it is like any other household poisoningthe child simply swallows something he has found. other senators have introduced bills to require safety caps on medicine bottles so that it would be difficult for children to open them. this would indeed be worthwhile. but pharmacists recommend that we take the further step of requiring all medicine be kept in a locked closet out of childrens reach. most homes do  have such cabinets. although at least five companies manufacture them under a governmentowned patent which is available to all who want to use it. there are two types of devices currently available--one for a sliding door cabinet and one for a swing door cabinet. both were developed from a prototype invented by dr. elbert l. chapman. a retired chief of the public health services division of accident control. who turned the patent over to the government. for the swing door cabinet. there is a threebutton device with the buttons spaced far egh apart so they can be controlled only by an adult hand. for the sliding door cabinet. there is a k device with finger tabs on either side which must be squeezed together while the k is pushed in and revolved. the legislation i am introducing amends eight different laws and applies the same standard to family housing constructed by the department of defense. the agencies which administer these programs already have adopted various standards which must be met but e of them deal with safety latches on medicine cabinets. in order to obtain a uniform standard for all of the programs. i felt this legislation should be submitted to congress in the form of legislation because congress has a broader responsibility than any individual agency.
 to declare the month of march 1968 as national jewish hospital save your breath month. the national jewish hospital. a sectarian medical center in denver. colo. for many years has engaged in research and education as well as the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with respiratory diseases. the designation of national jewish hospital save your breath month will serve to emphasize the major public health problem presented by chronic respiratory disease and to alert all people to the need to observe appropriate safeguards for their own respiratory health.
the senator is correct. as a matter of fact. i believe that this perhaps is the strongest argument for the amendment that senator clark and i are urging at this time. the very difficulty of attempting to set down categorically things that are right and things that are wrong leaves an area of this sort. in which so many factual situations necessarily arise. where relationships are so delicate. and where many times. in the last analysis. a man is obliged to act in accordance with his conscience. i believe disclosure is better than attempting by prescription to deal with it in detailed ways. and i believe that one of the difficulties the committee got itself into is that it has attempted to avoid complete disclosure and still to meet certain problems that were the direct reason for its creation. i believe it would be better to turn to the disclosure method and to eliminate some of the specifics.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record a tabulation showing the effect that the amendment of the senator from louisiana would have upon the federal share to be paid on the cost of the medicare program as opposed to what is payable under the present formula.
. alabama  would get 78.6 percent. they would be reduced to 61.78 percent. louisiana would be receiving . if it had a medicaid program. 74.58 percent from the federal government. its share would be reduced to 55.62 percent. new jersey . under the present law. gets only 50 percent of its medicaid programswhen it has onepaid for by the federal government. and this would reduce it to 25 percent. the same is true of a dozen or more states. of course. i recognize that this is based upon a formula. but the formula operates inequitably where it operates. it should  be extended to this program. which essentially is  a program for indigent people. but is a program for extending to all the people in the country the best kind of medical care this country can provide. i hope the amendment will be rejected. the states which are treated the same way as new jerseythat is. where the federal share is reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent under this formulaare as follows: connecticut. delaware. district of columbia. hawaii. illis. indiana from 53 to 28 percent. iowa from 59 to 35 percent. kansas from 57 to 33 percent. going to the 50to25 again: maryland. massachusetts. michigan. minnesota from 58 to 34 percent. nevada from 50 to 25 percent. new jersey from 50 to 25 percent. new york from 50 to 25 percent. ohio from 52 to 27 percent. puerto rico stays at 50 percent. rhode island from 52 to 27 percent. the state of washington from 50 to 25 percent. wyoming from 59 to 35 percent. wisconsin from 56 to 32 percent. many states are reduced. and i do  believe this should be done. as a further reason for  adopting this amendment. it should  be put to the senate. without any report. as an amendment to a bill dealing with entirely extraneous matters. at this time. late in our consideration of this bill. i hope the senate will reject the amendment.
. the recent action of the senate in cutting back on federal participation in the medicaid program seriously impairs a commitment congress made several years ago to provide better health care for the nations lowincome citizens. moreover. it places a very heavy burdenretroactively--on the states at a time when every state is finding it increasingly difficult to keep pace with the rising cost of government. when congress enacted the kerrmills medical assistance bill in 1960. it recognized that the federal government had a responsibility to help achieve a higher level of health care in this nation. this commitment was substantially broadened and reemphasized in 1965 when we passed the medicare bill. title 19 of the bill authorized the medicaid program. at that time we told the states that if they developed a state program to provide medical care for those whose income was just above the poverty line. the federal government would pay a certain percentage of the costs of the program. the people we were concerned about were those who were generally selfsupporting. but whose incomes were  high egh to be able to afford decent medical care. though too high to qualify for welfare assistance. thirtynine states have already responded to the challenge by. implementing title 19 medicaid programs. others. including my own state of new jersey. are currently in the process of developing programs. according to hew. more than 8.5 million people will receive medical help this year under title 19.. of this number. 1.25 million are medically needy people who are  on welfare rolls. in its hasty adoption of the long of louisiana amendment. however. the senate took an action which would undo much of the progress we have already made. if this amendment is allowed to stand. it means purely and simply that we are reneging on our commitment to upgrade the level of health care in this country. the long amendment will have a drastic effect on those states which have shown their concern and which have been willing to take on the financial responsibility of implementing medicaid programs. under the formula in the amendment. the states which have been doing the most to help people in need will be hurt the most. new york. california. and connecticut. for example. would have their federal share cut in half. so would illis. maryland. massachusetts. and michigan. my own state of new jersey which has spent the past year and a half working out a program based on a 50percent federal matching share would find that program emasculated. since the federal share would drop to 25 percent. some states have already indicated that they may have to discontinue aid to the medically needy altogether. last week the 24 states having title 19 programs for the medically needy estimated the loss of federal funds in fiscal year 1969 under the long amendment. among the states which would suffer substantial losses are: amount of reduction in federal funds. fiscal year 1969 [in millions] state: california ----------------------$27. 5 connecticut ----------------------6.0 district of columbia ---------------4.0 illis --------------------------6.9 maryland -------------------------8.5 massachusetts --------------------40.0 michigan -------------------------8. 9 minnesota -----------------------16. 0 new york ----------------------129.1 pennsylvania ---------------------30.5 washington ----------------------9.0 this is  a regional or sectional matter. it is a national one and represents a national commitment. the principal argument being made against continuing the present level of federal sharing in the medicaid program is that it is costing more than originally estimated. while it is unfortunate that we were  given more accurate estimates. this is excuse for abdicating our responsibility for a program with so much potential for helping millions of people. if the question were simply one of saving the government $500 million this year. as proponents of the amendment argue is necessary. i am certain those savings could be found without jeopardizing the health of the nations poor and without placing an intolerable financial burden on the states. as one who believes we should maintain a strong commitment to provide decent health care for the needy. i urge the senate to reconsider this matter. i am certain we can afford the dollars the amendment purports to save. i suggest we can ill afford the permanent damage the amendment would do to the medicaid program.
 johnson takes leave of his office and its burdens. he can take justifiable- pride on the domestic achievements of his administrationin education. social security. health and civil rights. his obvious disappointment in the pursuit of peace is shared by most americans who ackledge the sincerity of his effort and regret the failure of that effort as he does. it is a privilege to join my colleagues in expressing high personal regard for mr. johnson and best wishes to him in his new career.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would amend eight different federal programs to require that medicine cabinets used in federally assisted housing must be equipped with latches designed to prevent young children from opening the cabinets. this is the same bill i have introduced in the past. the need for the bill has increased steadily since i first introduced it in 1966. the national center for health statistics in the department of health. education. and welfare reports there were at least 384.000 cases of accidental poisonings among children 5 years of age and younger during 1967. the most recent year for which figures are available. death resulted in 375 of those cases. manufacturers of medicines have recognized the dangers of children getting at medicine and they voluntarily agreed to bottle their products in containers with safety caps which are difficult for children to remove. this is a commendable step. but it has  halted the upward trend of child poisonings. the bill i am introducing today could reverse the trend. it could save the lives of hundreds of children. i strongly urge consideration of the bill early in this congress.
. in a special message to congress. warned of a "massive crisis" in health care within the next 2 or 3 years. with the demand for health services far exceeding the capacity of our existing health system. i believe the crisis is already upon us. congress has enacted several farreaching programs to increase the supply of doctors. nurses. and allied health workers and has committed millions of dollars to building our capability to attack fatal and debilitating diseasesheart disease. cancer. mental illness. and many others. much of this research is done by our medical schools. for the federal government to cut back on the commitment we have made in these areas would be extremely shortsighted. the situation is espedially critical in new jersey. where we have two growing medical schoolsthe rutgers medical school. in new brunswick. and the new jersey college of medicine and dentistry. in newark. both are new and emerging schools and are faced with the problems of building new facilities. attracting high quality faculty. and building research teams. the newark school is located in the heart of a ghetto area and. in addition to the traditional task of training new doctors and dentists. has deeply involved itself in the life of the community. to meet the health needs of the areas 125.000 residents. the school has assumed responsibility for the city hospital and is developing family health care clinics. preventive medicine screening programs and other projects designed to reach the whole community. any cutback of federal support will inevitably disrupt and delay these important programs. the bill i am cosponsoring would authorize $100 million for grants to be made by the secretary of health. education. and welfare to medical and dental schools which are in financial distress and which have affirmatively responded to national health needs. because it is an emergency measure. the authorization is for 1 year. while the need to control inflation may well require the curtailment of some federal programs. i believe the cuts that are necessary should be made in low priority programs.  in programs vitally affecting the health and welfare of our people. certainly federal support of our medical colleges is an investment in the health of our people. i hope the senate will give prompt consideration to this emergency measure.
. i am glad to support the amendment offered by senator mondale. senator curtis and others. to delete the section of the tax reform act of 1969 placing a 40year limit on the life of private foundations. there are sound reasons why such a limitation should  be adopted. foundations occupy a unique place in american society. in areas where the government can or should  act. they have the skills and resources to initiate new ideas and to experiment with new and untried ventures. with their ability to act quickly and flexibly. they constitute a powerful instrument for developing and testing solutions to problems important in our society.  to be overlooked. too. is their contribution in sustaining and supplementing the educational and civic infrastructure. as it were. of our society. the direct involvement and support by foundations. for example. has played a vital role in the advancement of medical science and the strengthening of public education in this century. admittedly. the occasional abuses and mistakes of judgment by some foundations. as well as their inative activities in the areas of social experimentation have raised questions over whether private philanthropy should continue to be encouraged by granting tax exemption privileges. the finance committee has recommended that these questions be resolved by limiting the life of foundations to 40 years. this rule would. without question. discourage. if  destroy. private philanthropy as it exists today. the effect on charitable work of limiting the life of all foundations. regardless of size or contribution to society. would be irreparable. such an arbitrary step is  consistent with the broader effort being made to bring about meaningful reform. furthermore. it runs counter to the findings of a number of groups. including the department of the treasury. who have studied the question and rejected the idea of fixing a time for foundations to go out of business. by any measure. it is clear that foundations have made substantial contributions to the quality of american life. in my own state of new jersey. some 200 national and local foundations are currently helping to meet local and statewide needs. particularly in urban areas. while public attention is often focused on grants made by the large wellkn foundations. it is eworthy that much significant work is being done by small local foundations. for example. the bulk of grants being made by one new jersey foundation are directed toward needs in the city of newark where support is provided for such groups as the newark family service bureau. the community information and referral center. the citys ym/ ywca and the newark board of education. aher new jersey foundation has specialized in nursing education and has pioneered a number of inations in providing improved health care. it has established four tuitionfree nursing schools. two of them in new jersey. and has contributed more than $10 million since 1934 to meeting health needs. still aher new jersey foundation has expended some $12 million since 1935 in providing specialized services for underprivileged children. the scholarship assistance provided to over 500 children through juvenile court judges throughout the state and the foundations grants to state institutions are strong arguments for continuing this type of philanthropy and for support of the mondalecurtis amendment. i do  believe it is sound public policy to legislate away private philanthropy in the guise of reform and destroy the vast reservoir of private initiative and skill. perhaps more needed than at any time in recent history. the abuses which have occurred must be corrected. but the institution of foundations should  be destroyed in the process. i urge the senate to delete the 40year provision by supporting this amendment.
the senator from montana has. this is said very kindly. that language could be interpreted to exclude. as the senator from kentucky said in the statement the senator from montana read about it. it seems to me. air support. i do  think there is doubt about that. the senator from florida made that point. if by "combat troops" is going to be meant just ground combat troops. that is all right. i am going to support the ambiguity. because i think any public statement we make is likely to get us into much worse trouble in the world than just repeating what we have said before. i think we can all agree on one thing: we are  going to have american foot soldiers go in there. beyond that. i am  sure what this amendment would do. and i do  think it matters too much. but. on the basis that there is a great deal of ambiguity here as to exactly what may be permitted. so long as that one basic thing is excluded. that is the medicine we had better take today.
. i am pleased to join senators kennedy. cooper. and saxbe as a cosponsor of s. 3. the health security act of 1971. today the question of national health insurance is  whether we should have a national health program. the facts dictate that we do. it is. rather. what kind of program will best serve all our people. it is shocking that medical care is so difficult to obtain. and that so many people have little or health coverage at all. when america is spending $63 billion a year on health care. this sum amounts to about 7 percent of our gross national product. or about $300 for every man. woman. and child. despite the fact that we spend more on health than any other nation. america lags behind most industrial nations in health standards. clearly something must be done to i change the system by which medical care md services are delivered. it must be t nade more equitable and much more eficient. in a country as wealthy and re.ourceful as ours. there is reason why i every citizen. rich or poor. young or old. working or unemployed. should be denied the right to good health care. as one of the earliest supporters of medicare and as a member of the senate appropriations subcommittee dealing with health. i have long believed that we must do better in making health care a matter of high national priority. the health security act of 1971 is the product of months of study by outstanding citizens involved in health care and many other areas of human and social concern. it is my hope that the proposal will be carefully considered this year and that the 92d congress will enact legislation establishing a system capable of making quality health care available to every citizen of the united states.
s council on environmental quality has warned that ocean dumping will become a serious problem on a nationwide basis in the future if something is  done to halt it . to those who makes their living from the waters off the new jersey coast. the problem is seriousindeed critical. and it is easy to recognize that it is only a matter of time before others along all of the coasts of the united states will experience similar. if  worse. problems. it is time that we adopt a national policy to control effectively the dumping of wastes which already have turned some offshore areas into dead seas incapable of supporting any form of life. several different bills have been submitted to control ocean dumping. i am introducing legislation that incorporates provisions of legislation introduced by congressman charles sandman in the house of representatives together with additional features that i believe will help develop a strong program in this area. other bills dealing with ocean dumping are limited in jurisdiction to an area extending 12 nautical miles from shore. by controlling the disposition of the wastes at the loading site. the bill i am introducing would make possible effective control of dumping anywhere in the ocean waters or the waters of the great lakes. during the first 5 years after enactment of my bill it would permit the loading of wastes onto vessels only if these wastes will be dumped beyond the continental shelf of the united states. this control will be exercised through authority given to the administrator of the environmental protection agency to issue permits for loading of the wastes onto the vessels while they are in port. after the 5year period. the bill would prohibit dumping anywhere in ocean waters or the waters of the great lakes. during this 5year period. the bill authorizes the administrator of the environmental protection agency to conduct and encourage research into means of recovering useful materials from wastes and disposal of wastes in a manner that will  endanger the public health and welfare. the agency also may give financial and other assistance to appropriate public and private agencies to conduct such research and demonstration projects. in some cases. feasible and ecoic landbased disposal methods already are available for wastes currently being dumped into the oceans and the great lakes. in these cases. the authority given to the administrator will help to make these methods kn to those who need them and demonstration projects will show their utility. the authority for research and demonstration projects in our bill is modeled after similar provisions in the resource recovery act of 1970. but the 1970 act .applies only to solid waste. our bill would apply to all wastes currently being dumped in our oceans. whether they are in solid. liquid or other form. our bill would immediately ban dumping in the area where it is most serious. between the shore and the edge of the continental shelf. but it goes on from there. it recognizes that eventually ail ocean dumping must be halted because it will damage our ocean resources even if dumped beyond the continental shelf. at the same time. it recognizes that ocean dumping will  be halted until there are feasible alternatives. eventually. international cooperation will be needed to preserve our oceans. in my view. the best way to stimulate this international cooperation is for this country to set an example by demonstrating that ocean dumping can beand will behalted. the time is short. only recently. the food and drug administration doubled its estimates of the amount of polluted wastes being dumped into the atlantic ocean. and the environmental quality council warns that pressures will increase to dump additional wastes off the gulf and pacific coasts. as well as in the great lakes. if steps are  taken quickly.
. as a cosponsor of this important legislation for sickle cell anemia. i hope we will have an affirmative vote today. sickle cell anemia is a disease. that mainly affects black americans. especially children. i am told that the disease damages the tissues of the body. and. as a result. the life expectancy of those afflicted with the disease is lowered to 20 years of age. one out of every 500 black chiidren have sickle cell anemia and one out of every 12 blacks carry the sickle cell trait. according to recent statistics. i understand that there is kn cure for this disease. the major goal of the legislation before us today is to create a voluntary program for identifying and counseling for sickle cell anemia and to sponsor ways to prevent the worst effects of the disease. very often families do  even k that they have the disease. especially when it is in its early stages. and there. are ways to ease the pain. of the affliction. the bill also provides research funds so that a cure can be sought for sickle cell anemia. there have been some encouraging research developments and it would be most unfortunate if these research initiatives can be followed through for lack of funds. the children of our nation need this care and the benefits of this research.
. today i am introducing legislation that will pave the way for the development of a medical school and veterans hospital in southern new jersey. the legislation will authorize the administrator of veterans affairs to enter into agreements with hospitals. medical schools. or medical installations. and residency training. appropriated funds can be used to pay a medical school for the cost of training during the time the intern or resident serves in the veterans administration hospital. construction of a medical school and hospital is very important and i have urged the office of management and budget to set aside funds for this program. however. unless the veterans administration has legislative authorization to enter into formal agreements with a medical school. the program can get underway. at this time the veterans administration does  have the authority to do this. the bill i am introducing today has already passed the house of representatives and requires only senate action. it is similar to a draft proposal submitted by the administration to the 91st congress. i ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed at this point in the record.
i thank my new hampshire for yiel time. ntention of the . if i he senate ac- may have the attention of the senator aillion for part from california . is my by the house. understanding correct that his amend$2 million. to ment provides for the adding of $30 mil. title v esea lion for health manpower construction the house fig- grants. t c. since this . and the senator the hathaway from new hampshire.
. at this time i have a report similar to that carried in many newspapers recently. it appeared in the journal of american medical association. written by dr. albert stunkard and several of his colleagues. it is entitled "influence of social class on obesity and thinness in children." it relates to early childhood nutrition. i think it is a very important study. and i ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the record.
. i wish to commend the senator from california and join him in supporting this amendment. i think it is an important and useful thing he is attempting to do. we have discussed this matter beforehand. and i would like to seek to broaden the amendment offered by the senator from california to insure that the disregard of the 20percent social security benefits increase will apply to recipients of medicaid and also to participants in the food stamp program. thousands of medicaid recipients and food stamp program participants will be cut out of the medicaid programs and food stamp programs altogether. in my own state hundreds may be forced to leave nursing homesand in other states which allow medicaid coverage under a special category kn as "medically needy" the cost of remaining in the medicaid program will increase substantially for the individual. perhaps prohibitively. medicaid provides a number of vital services to older persons receiving minimal social security benefits---services ranging from the purchase of necessary drugs. eyeglasses. hearing aids. home care. nursing home care. and partial doctors fees. congress had intention. in passing the 20percent social security increase. of forcing older citizens out of nursing homes or in reducing real benefits they may receive. but this will be the result unless this timely action is taken. for the 20percent increase already is in effect. we are  speaking about new expendituressince older citizens are already receiving this aid. in my view this action ranks differently from the fuller consideration of the other social security amendments that are to be proposed by the senate finance committee and the senator from louisiana later in this session. since the purpose of my amendment is to remedy an oversight in the passage of public law 92336.
. is vital to the health and wellbeing of millions of americans. to remain a meaningful program. however. the benefits provided to recipients must keep pace with changes in the cost of living. i urge adoption of this amendment.
. during consideration of the laborhew appropriaations bill 2 years ago. the senate passed by a rollcall vote my amendment to strike from the bill restrictive language exempting from coverage of the occupational safety and health act employers who employ 15 or fewer employees. that provision would have exempted more than 86 percent of all business establishments from coverage under the act and would have left a full onefourth of the nations work force without the protection of the act. in subsequent votes. the senate rejected an attempt to exempt businesses with seven or fewer employees and rejected an attempt to exempt businesses with four or fewer employees. although an exemption for businesses with three or fewer employees was finally included in the bill. the bill was vetoed and the veto was sustained. as a result. the law contains exemption from coverage from the occupational safety and health act by size of business. this is as it should be. employees of small businesses are every bit as entitled to protection from occupational safety and health hazards as employees of large concerns. this year. both the laborhew subcommittee and the full appropriations committee have adhered to this concept of equal protection. my amendment in subcommittee struck from the bill house language exempting from coverage businesses with 25 or fewer employees. the full committee supported this action. obviously. such an exemption would be even more discriminatory than the "15 or fewer" exemption the senate so wisely rejected 2 years ago. in a letter to me early last month secretary of labor peter j. brennan expressed his strong opposition to the house amendment. the secretary said. i can conceive of rational basis for excluding any employees from a statute like this one and least of all on any numerical basis. the point the secretary makes. and one with which i strongly concur. is that a "numbers game" should  be the issue here. the question is  whether we exempt businesses with 25 employees. or with 15. or with 7. or even with 3. the question is whether we take the stand that the law shall apply equally to all workers. i am pleased that the secretarys answer to that question is quite clear. and i commend his views to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent to include secretary brennans letter in the record at this point.
. hing is more important to the.future of our country than the health of our nations children. and all of us in the congress k this. that is why i have joined in sponsoring legislation to expand and improve all our child nutrition programs. including the summer lunch program. a particular problem has arisen in connection with this years summer lunch program however. it is almost the end of march. and the time is upon us when the states are gearing up for this summers program. but they can do so unless congress acts to authorize the program. and the funds for it. we do  have the time. before the easter recess. to consider and come to agreement on amendments to all of the federal feeding programs. that is why i am joining in the effort to pass legislation authorizing the summer program through september 30 of this year. at the fiscal year 1974 level. in new jersey alone last year. there were 532 sites serving lunches to 56.770 children each day during the summer. the amount of federal money for the program amounted to $2.860.655. this year. with the unemployment rate still on the rise in new jersey and currently touching almost 11 percent. continuation of this program. at least at the level of last year. is vital. as we all k. unemployment is  the only thing that has increased in the past year. food costs have also continued to rise. by some 10 to 15 percent. we have acted in congress to tie food stamps to the consumer price index. and i hope that we will succeed in doing the same thing for the summer lunch program. if we do . we will be reducing the level of the program by as much as 15 percent. this is something that we simply can afford to do.
chief medical director. the veterans administration. washington. d.c. dear doctor chase: enclosed for your reference is a copy of a letter i have received. together with an article from the international review of chiropractic. concerning the use of chiropractic services within the va. you will find this material selfexplanatory. i would appreciate your reviewing the comments of doctor elich. and your providing me with a report on the current policy of the department of medicine and surgery on the utilization of chiropractic services within the va. in preparing your response. it would be helpful if you could answer the following questions and provide the rationale underlying each response: 1. are chiropractic services currently available on an inpatient basis for va patients. if so. what is the procedure for determining the need for chiropractic services. if these services are  available. what criteria are used to determine their availability. 2. has the va experienced any requests from patients desiring chiropractic services on an inpatient basis. if so. what is the magnitude of these requests and how are they handled. 3. are chiropractic services available on an outpatient basis for va patients. if so. what is the procedure for determining the need for these services. if these services are  available. what is the underlying rationale for their availability. 4. has the va experienced requests from patients desiring chiropractic services on an outpatient basis. if so. how are these requests handled. and what are their magnitude. 5. if chiropractic services are authorized on a contract basis. could you explain the procedure for reimbursement. together with the annual cost for such services. 6. is it the position of the va that legislative authority does or does  exist to provide chiropractic services (a) on an inpatient basis. (b) on an outpatient basis. 7. if the va authorizes chiropractic services on an outpatient basis. but  on an inpatient basis. what is the rationale underlying this distinction. i shall appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience regarding this request. and want to take this opportunity to thank you for your good work in the department of medicine and surgery. with best wishes. very truly.
. as a cosponsor of both the dolemcgovern and church resolutions to retain the nutrition and aging committees in their present form. i urge my colleagues to vote in their favor. the work of the select committee on nutrition and human needs and the special committee on aging is far too important to too many people to be transferred to other committees. i have received hundreds of letters and telegrams and petitions from my new jersey constituents concerning the past accomplishments of these committees and urging their retention. as christine van lenten of the national child nutrition project. new brunswick. n.j.. wrote: nutrition programs require considerations of health. poverty. education and food production issues. it is the unique advantages of the nutrition committee to be able to bring all these perspectives to bear on this subject. should responsibility for oversight -of all the nations nutrition programs be shifted to the agriculture committee. there is certain to be a severe reduction in the number of staff persons assigned to them. this alone will make it impossible for these important programs to receive the rigorous and comprehensive congressional review they require. when so much. has been accomplished in the area of nutrition programs over the past few years. it would be a sorry step backwaxds. indeed. to do away with the one committee most responsible for these advances. with regard -to the aging committee. ernest p. haygood. sr.. chairman of the newark senior citizens commission. has succinctly put the case: our policy makers should reexamine the tireless work. ideas and effort that have come out of this committee. we have been looking forward with great enthusiasm to implementing some of these goals in 1977. this committee has survived because of the competent men serving our elderly. the senior citizens have a vital interest in this committee. it has given them a sense of security. it seems to me that these arguments in support of retaining the nutrition and aging committees in their present form are valid. and i urge my colleagues to vote to see that they are retained.
the senate anpropriations committee. in considering the 1977 supplemental appropriations bill. concurred with the house action in adding $2.000.000 for the newly authorized national alcohol research centers. in its report accompanying this bill. the committee stated: this additional funding will allow the niaaa to create several national alcohol research centers at established and experienced alcohol research schools and/or institutes. the committee clearly recognizes the growing problem of teenage and womens alcoholism programs and is hopeful that centers such as these will contribute to finding a solution to a disease which afflicts over 10 million americans. in my own state of new jersey. the internationally kn rutgers center of alcohol studies is dedicated to the solution of all alcohol problems. is this the sort of center the senator has in mind for designation as a national center.
. providing health care for all americans in the most rational. effective. and humane manner at an affordable cost is one of the primary problems facing our nation. i should like to call to the attention of the senate a speech which was recently given by our colleague from massachusetts. senator edward brooke. to the licensed practical nurses of massachusetts. senator brooke  only pays welldeserved tribute to the skills and devotion which lpns display in the widest possible variety of health care settings but he also points out the increasingly important role which these key health care providers must play. and be allowed to play. in the future. i ask that senator brookes speech be printed in the record. the address follows:
. i shall support this amendment which i consider to be an expression of part of the national responsibility for health. the program of a hot lunch for school children has met with the universal approval of mothers. teachers. educational authorities. and parentteacher associations. the cost is infinitesimal compared to the benefits. the health of the child determines the health of the man. i look forward to legislation which will be a national expression of the responsibility for the health of all citizens. the continuation of the schoollunch program is an early and a necessary step.
 hoover. in whom many of the members of this house have great confidence and who went into this thing in very great detail and studied it thoroughly. said he is for this bill. he is for this bill for $350.000.000. i am confident he looked into the unrra situation as well. and would have drawn attention to any such circumstance as might enable unrra to carry on. finally. let us look at the record on this question of adequacy of the funds provided. is the $310.000.000. for relief to the countries to be aided. which is  contained in the conference report. necessary. and how is it reconciled with the proposition that the general fund for relief may  get contributions from other nations. the record on that is very clear. i call the attention o: the members to page 107. it says that $180.000.000 is neczssary for grains alone to take care of just 1947 for the six principal countries under consideration. the remainder. the difference between $180.000.000 and a total of $296.000.000 needed for food alone. or $116.000.000. is needed for fats. meat. pulses. and dairy productsall foods. therefore. your $296.000.000 is the minimum food figure. it compares with a base figure of $290.000.000 provided in the bill. that leaves out medical supplies. materials for clothing. fuel. fertilizer. and other items in this bill. this food to sustain a diet of 2.000 to 2.100.calories per day compares with average united states consumption of 3.400 calories per day. if the house approves this conference report. therefore. you will be enabling the united states at least to fill out the elementary basic food needs of these peoples.
. i have introduced in the house today a bill endorsed by the american heart association. the leading private agency in the field. which provides for a program of research in diseases of the heartand circulation and to aid in the development of more effective methods of prevention.-diagis. and treatment of such diseases to be administered through a national heart disease institute in the united states public health service. this bill should truly appeal to the nation. in return for the expenditure of a fraction of what was spent on a month of destruction by the united states in world war ii. new hope and opportunity to live out their lives can be given to millions of people in our own country who otherwise will have to face the tragic prospect of being stricken down in youth or the prime of life by heart disease. heart disease strikes  only at the old. causing nearly one out of every two deaths after the age of 45. but it saps the strength of the youth of the nation as well. it causes more deaths among children and the young between the ages of 5 and 19 than any other disease. a pathetically small amount of money is  being spent on research to cut the death toll of those who suffer from the nations  1 killerheart disease. although congress has allocated $29.866.200 for research and control of plant and animal diseases. to the department .ot agriculture alone. specific amount has been set aside in the budget of the united states for research in cardiovascular diseases. during world war iithe most destructive in historybattle deathsin our countrys armed forces approximated 325.000. but during the same period more than 2.000.000 meri. women. and children on the home front were killed by diseases of the heart. heart disease takes a greater death toll than the five other leading causes. of death combined. voluntary agencies such as the amerlean heart association have been doing yeoman work in leading the fight against heart disease. but thus far their research program in the care. prevention. and treatment of this disease has been seriously handicapped by lack of funds. the united states -public health service which is responsible for raising the standards of health throughout the country and for administering the various health programs which have been established. should be -given adequate funds to help meet the challenge of this disease. which has been allowed to take its toll in human lives too long without a spirited attempt to do something about the situation.
. i am deeply grateful that the committee has seen fit to accept my amendment. which will set an outside time limit of 1 year within which the special commission for heart diseases must formulate and recommend to the national science foundation an overall research program in the field of heart and cardiovascular diseases. this applies equally to the special commissions for cancer and polio. i wish to gratefully ackledge the advice and help of my colleague the gentleman from minnesota in connection with this amendment. i hope at this time to call attention to the problem dealt with by my bill. h. r. 3762. to provide for research relating to diseases of the heart and circulation and to aid in tlhe development of more effective methods of prevention. diagis. and treatment of such diseases. and for other purposes. which has the support of the american heart association. the leading professional agency in the field. though cancer research has had appropriations of over $14.000.000 for the next fiscal yearaside from $25.000.000 for cancer research in the appropriations for the atomic energy commissionand research in infantile paralysis has had emous support. there is estimated to be spent currently about $1.200.000 per annum for research in diseases of the heart and arteries. outside the national institute of health. and that has. i understand. only a small amount available which might be devoted to this problem. this despite the fact that heart disease is the  1 killer of our people. more than 587.000 men. women. and children died of heart diseases in 1945. twice as many as the number of americans who lost their lives in battle in world war ii. deaths from heart diseases rate 3 times as high as cancer. 6 times as high as from accidents. 11 times as high as from tuberculosis. and at least 500 times as high as from infantile paralysis. a broadscale attack on theproblem of heart diseases is essential in order to cut down this ghastly death toll. my bill. h.r. 3762. provides for such a broadscale attack on the problem of heart diseases. in the same way as we are attacking the problems of cancer and of mental..health. it initiates a program immediately through vesting its administration in .the surgeon generals office. by setting. up a heart disease institute in the national institute of health. it also provides for a national heart disease council. composed of leading medical and scientific authorities. and other citizens. which is given full control over research and research projects. in this way. administrative efficiency is obtained.but initiative and scientific resources are  sacrificed. let us hope that the special commission on heart diseases appointed under this bill will immediately proceed with its work. at the same time we. should push forward with a program contemplated by my bill. h. r. 3762. which is designed to bring research in heart diseases up to parity with the work being done in cancer and infantile paralysis. when the national science foundation is really under way all this research can be integrated under its auspices.
may i just answer both points as to the objections of the secretary of war. my previous bill. h. r. 3762. which was the original bill introduced in june 1947 and supported by the american heart association. on which the bill before us was drafted. did provide that there should be appropriations. but the gentleman from new jersey . when he introduced this bill before us  as the committee amendment. eliminated all reference to appropriations. hence there is provision for appropriations in this bill. only a provision for establishing an organization and a plan to coordinate and go forward with the job of national heartdisease research. as to the provisions with respect to additional assistance in the public health service. the reason that was put in. i understand from the chairman of the committee. was that added responsibilities were given to the surgeon general by this bill. the chairman of the committee informs me that he is ready to eliminate that from this bill so as  to complicate the immediate issue. which is to establish an institute for going after this heartdisease problem so critical to the country. if the gentleman from kansas will withdraw his reservation of objection. i shall offer an amendment to that effect. in the hearings held in may 1948. which are referred to in the remarks of the chairman of the committee. the gentleman from new jersey . there were also considered. pursuant to the ice of hearing. my bill h. r. 3762. introduced june 9. 1947. specifically providing for a program of research relating to diseases of the heart and circulation. and the bill of the distinguished gentleman from wisconsin . h. r. 5087. for the same specific purpose. action had been taken on that bill which was referred to the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce because last year the chairman of that committee. hon. charles a. wolverton. provided for a special commission for heart diseases in the national science foundation bill. h. r. 4102. which was passed by both the house and senate but vetoed by the president. the urgent necessity for taking prompt and constructive action to deal with the problem of heart disease is well kn to everyone. and that is why there has been such great interest both in and out of congress as to the best way to attack the nations  1 killerheart disease. in 1947. when testifying before the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce in behalf of h. r. 3762. 1 said: my bill. h. r. 3762. provides for such a broadscale attack on the problem of heart diseases in the same way as we are attacking the problems of cancer and of mental health. it initiates a program immediately. though vesting its administration in the surgeon generals office by setting up a heart disease institute in the national institute of health. it also provides for a national heart disease council. composed of leading medical and scientific authorities and other citizens which is given full control over research and research projects. in this way. administrative efficiency is obtained. but initiative and scientific resources are  sacrificed: the bill is endorsed by the american heart association. the leading professional association in this field. action to provide for research relating to diseases of the heart and circulation. etc.. is called for without delay. i deferred to the judgment of the members of the house interstate and foreign commerce committee last year and to my other colleagues that the job could be started at least within the framework of the national science foundation. after introducing an amendment to the national science foundation bill which set an outside time limit of 1 year within which the special commission for heart disease must formulate and recommend to the national science foundation an overall research program in the field of heart and cardiovascular diseases. that amendment was adopted by the congress and i sad last july 16 on the floor that i hoped in this way to call attention to the problemdealt with by my bill. but that i was convinced that a broadscale attack on the problem of heart disease was essential in order to cut down on the ghastly death toll caused by heart diseases. i believe that what i said at that time is even more pertinent today. the president vetoed the national science foundation bill and aher year has gone by with its sorry story in terms of deaths caused by heart disease without anything constructive having been done. there is longer any reason to put off facing the issue squarely and courageously. although an appropriation for over $14.000.000 has been provided for cancer research during the fiscal year 1948 aside from the $25.000.000 for cancer research in the appfopriation for the atomic energy commission. and although research in infantile paralysis has had emous support. there is only $3.500.000 per annum being currently spent for research in diseases of the heart and arteries by the federal government and something over $1.000.000 by. private agencies. it seems hardly possible that a disease which caused the death of more than 587.000 men. women. and children in 1945. a number twice as large as that of the americans who lost their lives in battle in world war ii can be overlooked by the congress. deaths from heart disease ran three times as high as cancer. six times as high as from accidents. and 11 times as high as from tb. only a broadscale attack on heart diseases can accomplish anything. to ecoize on the health of our people is to undermine and jeopardize the welfare and security of our nation. the true picture of the disastrous effect of heart disease on the health. ecoic productivity and social well being of the nation can be measured alone by the number of deaths it produces. diseases of the heart and blood vessels cause a greater number of permanent disabilities than any other single disease. they are responsible for a loss of more than 150.000.000 work days annually. heart disease strikes at the very heart of our citizenry. it takes its toll among youngsters as well as among those who are growing old and who are expected to show the wear and tear of the years. one out of every 10 rejected for military duty by selective service was turned down because of cardiovascular diseases and more than 40.000 men developed rheumatic fever during their military service. heart disease causes more deaths among children of 1015 years of age than any other disease. it causes nearly one out of every two deaths after the age of 45. these are statistics which should cause us to take heed and to tako action. in the light of these facts it is difficult to understand why something was  done about the situation long before this. constructive action must be delayed longer than it takes to consider and pass the legislation before us. dear representative javits: please accept our heartfelt thanks for the effort you are expending toward creation of a heartdisease institute. we have a little 5yearold girl who has a type of heart disease for which so far there is correction perfected. the creation of a central office within our health service will. we are sure. hasten many discoveries in the field of heart diseases. and be of inestimable aid to many thousands of sufferers. is there anything we might be able to do to be of assistance. again. with many sincere thanks. respectfully.
:...r. speaker. i ask unanimous consent to return to the bill to amend the public health service act to support research and training in diseases of the heart and circulation. and to aid the states in the development of community programs for the control of these diseases. and for other purposes. and ask unanimous consent that the page and line reference of the amendment submitted. which was adopted. be corrected.
. i am very happy to be able to join with my distinguished colleagues on the democratic side. the gentleman from tennessee . the gentleman from florida . and my distinguished colleague on the republican side. the gentleman from wisconsin . in introducing the bill for research into the causes and cure of rheumatism and arthritis. i would like to underscore what the gentleman from minnesota has just said about the fact that this whole program is of a pattern and that it ties in very closely with the enlargement of the research facilities of our state universities. medical schools. and research centers around the country. i think this pattern is the most eloquent rebuttal of the idea that by undertaking this humanitarian program the federal government is engaged in discouraging private and individual enterprise. on the contrary. it is bringing out the best in our private ecoy and in private research. it is at long last doing justice to the millions of sufferers from heart disease. cancer. mental illness. tuberculosis. and  rheumatism and arthritis who have found other adequate relief while they have seen billions expendednecessary as they arefor military weapons. a chart of the distribution of united states public health service funds for these research purposes. follows: distribution of united states public health service funds. by typesfiscal year 1949 intramural project teaching and grantsin- research research grantsmaid aid to medi- aid to construe- other total rsrch cal schools. atos resear fcllowship states tion grants national heart institute- ------------------------------------------------------- $257. 009 1 $1. 463. 300 2 $226. 600 $175. 000 ------------ $512. 079 $2. 633. 088 national cancer institute ------------------------------------------------ ---------- 2.760. 000 3.300.000 2.995.000 2.500.000 $8. 000. 000 2. 445. 000 22.000. 000 national mental health institute --------------------------------------------------07. 600 470.000 1.530.000 3. 550. 000 ---.......- 3. 420. 400 . 028. 000 tuberculosis --------------------------------------------------------------- 675. 000 (01. 666 7.900 .790. 000--1.878. 500 9. 953. 066 venereal---...... ------------------------------------------------- 678. 763 637. 04 3. 650 15. 008. 507-------- 21.589.338 17. 917. 922 arthritis and rheumatism --------------------------------------------------------------------- 106.284 7.300 (411.-. 584 deaths associated with childbirth (maternal. stillbirth. neonatal) ---------------- ------------ 62. 571 3. 00................... .......... . 66. 571 dental institute ------------------------------------------------------------- 173. 725 i168. 28 33. 550 ........- 1.000.000 1. 376. 203 i represents actual commitments at this time. amount budgeted for this purpose is $1.875.000. 2 includes $51.00 for research fellowships awarded at this time. amount budgeted for this purpose is $150.000. 3 plus antibiotics. unspecified amount included in $11.214.666 of general health grants.
. executive order 9981. and the direction of the secretary of defense. directive of april 6. 1949. considerable progress has been made in this respect in the navy and air force but much remains to be done in the army. consistent with the policy against segregation in the armed forces i did  consider it appropriate that there should be passed by the house on consent and without thorough consideration and debate in the whole house a measure which creates a segregated facility for veterans. i believe that the determinations of the committee on veterans affairs are entitled to great respect from the house. but i do  feel that the suggestion which i first made that the bill be passed over was amiss. under the circumstances. in view of the fact that the proponent of the bill objected to passing it over for 2 weeks and that further consideration required an objection. i was constrained to object to allow such further consideration. the attention of the members should be directed to the letter of the administrator of the veterans administration which is part of the committees report on this bill. it calls attention to other problems in this bill quite apart from the segregation aspect such as location in an isolated community. grave question as to whether adequate medical staff could be maintained. and a $5.000.000 cost which is. generally speaking. considerably in excess of appropriations authorized under bills on the consent calendar. i am informed that in the state of virginia and in nearby areas veterans who are negroes are admitted to existing hospital facilities and the letter of administrator gray above referred to so states. there is showing of critical need for additional facilities for veterans who are negroes as such. if the idea is to concentrate negroes  in other veterans hospitals in th carolina. maryland. west virginia. virginia. and the district of columbia ii this hospital it would only build up segregation the more. contrary to the definite policy going the other way in the armed forces.  would that be the kind of memorial suitable for booker t. washington. i have always supported and will continue to support. both as a veteran myself and as a member. full and complete medical care. including hospitalization. for the veteran. but in good conscience i can believe that the best interests of the veteran or the country are served by building up. rather than working to reduce and eliminate segregation among veterans or armed services personnel.
. the point is simply this. that building hospitals is  is.flationary. building hospitals is essential to our national security and national safety. building hospitals represents an asset which is better than money and a great deal better than the gold buried in the ground at fort k. and represents the creation of an asset and putting some of our resources into an asset vital to the future of our people. it is  inflationary to build hospitals for the benefit of the people of the state of new york or of any other state. and certainly it is essential to our national defense. when the program is established by as dependable a state agency as new york states hospital survey commission which finds it is needed and can be but insufficiently supplied under existing law despite the fact that twothirds of the money comes from state and local sources. and when they emphasize that most of those hospitals. 83 percent of them. are voluntary profit. sectarian. catholic. protestant. and jewish hospitals. the program appears to be eminently justified. you are  creating new government facilities here but rather making it possible for americans by voluntary means to help themselves.
it seems to me we are here  only to save money but we are here to appropriate money where the money is deserved. that is our duty and that is our responsibility. it is clear. both on the grounds of solid benefit to the country and on the grounds of national defense. that we ought to have an attitude of greater consideration with respect to the hospital provision of this appropriation bill.
that is exactly what i am saying. food represents 40 percent of the total cost of living of the moderateincome family. and so long as you do  control that effectively. and you do  under this law and under this bill. and you will do it even less so if the agriculture committees amendment is successfulso long as you do  really control food prices under this bill without preferencesyou are going to get a very short way with price stabilization. the text of the amendments which are in the alternative follows: (1) to repeal paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of section 402 of the defense production act of 1950 entirely. there being full power left in the act to protect in every way the legitimate interests of food producers. or (2) to strike out the first sentence of paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of section 402 and to insert in lieu thereof the following: "(3) ceiling shall be established or maintained for any agricultural* commodity below the highest of the following prices: (i) the support price for such commodity. as determined by the secretary of agriculture in accordance with the agricultural adjustment act of 1938. as amended. and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture for grade. location. and seasonal differentials. or (ii) the highest price received by producers during the period from may 24. 1950. to june 24. 1950. inclusive. as determined by the secretary of agriculture and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture for grade. location. and seasonal differentials. or (iii) in the case of any commodity for which the market was  active during the period may 24 to june 24. 1950. the average price received by producers during the most recent representative period prior to may 24. 1950. in which the market for such commodity was active as determined and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture to a level in line with the level of prices received by producers for agricultural commodities generally during the period may 24 to june 24. 1950. and adjusted by the secretary for grade. location. and seasonal differentials. or (iv) in the case of firecured tobacco a price (as determined by the secretary of agriculture and adjusted for grade differentials) equal to 75 percent of the support price of burley tobacco of the corresponding crop. and in the case of dark aircured tobacco and virginia suncured tobacco. respectively. a price (as determined by the secretary of agriculture and adjusted for grade differentials) equal to 632/ percent of the support price of burley tobacco of the corresponding crop."
the gentleman was kind egh to cend me a e that he was going to make this speech. and i appreciate it immensely. i would like to be sure i understand the gentleman clearly in respect to this near east situation. i understand the gentleman to say he wants the united states to declare that there will continue to be an israel. but he wants the united states to be sure that there will be aggressive expansion of that small country. i agree with the gentleman. i would like to emphasize also what the gentleman has said about appeasement and ask the gentleman whether he agrees with me that if the arab states made the price of their adherence to the west the unconscionable and unjust destruction of this small state of israel. that the gentleman would say that. too. is appeasement. and we should  knuckle under it and without being intimidated by any arab leaders w>o most irresponsibly may flirt with communism. the gentleman should k. too. that the chronic poverty. illiteracy. and disease in arab lands and the feudal conditions there are a big reason for the foment and that neither the west  israel should be made a scapegoat for this.
. we come  to a section of this bill which will always recall to my mind an outstanding personality who was a member of the house for many years. the hoable frank keefe. of wisconsin. mr. keefe gave a very great deal of himself in the creation of the national health institutes and in the whole program of research in the great killer diseases. heart. cancer. tuberculosis. and the others. he came from a state which is generally conservative in its thought. he was a conservative man himself. but he perceived one truth. and perhaps it was the greatest truth that he perceived in his life. that truth was that material resources in terms of our men. women. and children had to be preserved against the dreadful depredations of these dread diseases. that there was a big job to be done in research on cancer. heart disease. mental health. and all the fields. into which these appropriations  go and that the federal government had to take part in that field if the job was to be measurably forwarded and accelerated. i think with all humility and all deference to the chairmen of the subcommittees who worked with him a very long time. mr. keefe was. if  the most important in driving and pushing and working for this perceived truth. certainly as important as any other member of the congress in both bodies. i think the truth which he perceived as to the conservation of our human resources from disease by government aid to fundamental research in the causes and cures is of the greatest importance. i think these appropriations and the work which they cover are giving a sense of wellbeing to millions upon millions of americans. the subjects of these diseases who otherwise would face hopeless futures  only for themselves but for their families. i hope the house will indulge me for having called to its attention at this time the work of this outstanding former member.  deceased.
. it is the intention of the sponsors of this resolution that this expression of interest on the part of the congress should apply as well to the great country of pakistan. which is an important part of that subcontinent. we feel also that this should assure the people both of pakistan and of india that our interest is  limited by 1 years consideration of the mutual security program. but that it is a continuing one until they have adequately met their problems of new nationhood. sponsors of this bill are senators ralph e. flanders. republican. vermont. brien mcmahon. democrat. connecticut. wayne morse. republican. oregon. h. alexander smith. republican. new jersey. john j. sparkman. democrat. alabama. charles w. tobey. republican. new hampshire. alexander wiley. republican. wisconsin. and representatives frances p. bolton. republican. ohio. james g. fulton. republican. pennsylvania. jacob k. javits. republicanliberal. new york. chester e. metrow. republican. new york. edna f. kelly. democrat. new york. franklin d. roosevelt. jr.. democratliberal. new york. and clement j. zablocki. democrat. wisconsin. this action is taken in view of the need to assure the people of the whole subcontinent. and particularly the people of india. of backing in the fundamental struggle against very low standards of living and underdevelopment which the sponsors of the resolution believe to have a vital bearing upon the kind of society and government which will be found in the subcontinent and in india. a resolution of this kind is the only way under the constitutional processes of the united states in which the american people can express to the people of india a continuing interest in their 5year plan for ecoic development which will give the people of india some added assurance in addition to their own selfhelp that they may proceed with this plan with confidence in the sympathetic consideration of their needs by the people of the united states. india is a vital element in the free worlds security in an area of the world in which it is being the most directly and aggressively threatened by the soviet union and its satellites. open aggressive warfare by the communist bloc is  being waged in korea. indochina. and malaya and a campaign of threats and intimidation is also going on by the communist bloc against burma. thailand and indonesia and the countries of the subcontinent. the people of the subcontinent have taken careful e of the fact that communist china has already swallowed up tibet. indias 5year investment plan calls for a total investment of $3.765.000.000. india hs already received assistance from the united states of $283.100.000. the largest part of which is the $190.000.000 united states wheat loan. the net requirement for foreign assistance is $1.228.000.000. the united kingdom has agreed to release sterling balances at the rate of £35.000.000 per annum to india. but that part of the money is  part of the money available for the 5year development plan as this blocked sterling has been earmarked to finance the needs of private industry in india. it is expected that australia. new zealand. and canada will help india and that the international bank for reconstruction and development. which has already loaned $62.500.000 for ecoic development of india. will increase it lending operations. but it is estimated that all of these aids will still leave a gap of $1.000.000.000 in round figures. private industry in india and in cooperation with oversea capital can help greatly with the 5year plan and with indias problem of underdevelopment. foreign capital is being invited to india on very easy terms. the government of india is fully aware that foreign capital. before it comes into the country in any substantial quantity. must be assured of prospects of a fair return. equality of treatment. and facilities for transfer of profits. the measures already taken give that assurance. the agreements signed recently with the standard vacuum oil co. of america and the burmahshell group for the erection of oil refineries in india are evidence of the large concessions accorded to foreign investors. indias 5year development plan is fundamental. it deals almost exclusively with making india selfsufficient in food. the target is to produce 7.200.00 tons of additional food. 2.100.000 bales of jute. 1.200.000 bales of cotton. 37.000 tons of oil seeds and 69.000 tons of sugar. the plan covers the period from april 1951 to march 1956. as more than twothirds of the population of india is dependent on the land. development and irrigation will take first priority. of the total outlay of the different sectors of the indian ecoy. agriculture and the allied activities under irrigation and power will receive 43 percent. india has ample supply of water but at present is using about 6 percent of the flow of its rivers. although in india the area under irrigation is nearly 48.000.000 acresmore than twice as large as in any other country of the worldit constitutes only onefifth of the total area under cultivation. agriculture. therefore. is largely a gamble in rains. the area which is to be brought under irrigation under the plan is 8.800.000 acres by 195556 and when full facilities for these projects are developed. 16.500.000 acres. other parts of the plan include improvement of transport. 26.1 percent. development of certain vital industries. 6.7 percent. and extension of social services. such as housing. education. and medical relief. 17 percent. the plan consists of two parts. the first part. which is designed to restore the standards of consumption prevalent in india before the war1939taking into account the expected increase in pouulation over the period and which the government of india is committed to execute is expected to cost $3.135.000.000. the second part of this plan in terms of priority which is intended to insure a somewhat higher rate of development over the period is expected to cost $630.000.000. the sponsors of the resolution consider the essence of selfhelp and mutual cooperation in respect of indias ecoic problems to require an expression of a continuity of interest by the united states in the progress of indias 5year plan for ecoic development. this plan to be consistent with the capabilities of the people of india necessarily calls for more than the year or two for which united states constitutional processes permit appropriation. private enterprise should be the mainstay of indias ecoic development and this is apparently its governments intention. this resolution is intended to express sympathetic interest in what will be required of the public sector.
. when the cuts in va medical availabilities were made last year there was great protest by the veterans organizations. we have a chance to correct it . let us do it fully. it is almost impossible for the member who has  participated in the detail of this question. to get to the basic facts here. and you pretty well have to pin your faith on the conclusions from the facts arrived at by those members who have studied the situation in detail. our distinguished colleague from texas . has made a colorful appeal. and. as he generally does. is a lion in favor of what his own subcommittee decided and he carries the ball very well. indeed. the gentleman from texas is the author of the teague bill. the korean gi bill of rights. it was  a wild bill. it was a very conservative one. soundly conceived and carefully worked out after extensive hearings and study. it received overwhelming support in the house. today i shall follow the gentleman from texas . who. i think. is looking at this from the veterans point of view and has stated the question very fairly and forcibly. to carry out the veterans hospitalization program we need. according to mr. teagues findings this additional $10 million. we have cut $1.200.000.000 requested in this deficiency appropriation for defense. let us then. even if we should err on the side of generosity. appropriate $10 million more to veterans hospitalizationfor the men who make defense possible.
. i have kn our colleague.  of a great committee. in a completely secure district. we see him work even harder than ever. on radio. in public addresses. on television. in meetings. in getting colleagues to act together. as he has on that side of the aisle time and again. working to get so many of our colleagues together behind a particular issue. that is the kind of extracurricular duty which makes of a man a hero. this i k a great deal about. in this i k emanuel celler has served extremely well. it is gratifying to join in this tribute. this life is so full of strife. controversy. argument. and discussion that to have the unadulterated privilege for a full 2 hours of saying the good things that are in our hearts about a truly beloved colleague is as much a joy to us as it is to him. for emanuel celler. long and continued health and life in this great service which he has "started" so auspiciously. both to him and to his beloved wife. stella. every good wish.
 eisenhower. in a campaign address at los angeles. calif.. on october 10. 1952. stated: [it is] a sound investment in a sounder america to see to it that adequate medical care is made accessible and brought within the means of all our people. * * * the answer is to build on the system of voluntary. profit healthinsurance plans which our people have already developed at an amazing rate. he continued in his address with the following: the usefulness of federal loans or other aid to local health plans should be explored.
i think the record should show that our colleague who is speaking was one the sponsors of the -national health program which originated in the 81st congress. that program was the precursor of this legislation. and of the administrations health program. it was sponsored by the following republican members of the house in the 81st congress by our colleague  nixon and myself. and in the 83d congress by myself and mr. hale and the member  speaking. mr. scott. of pennsylvania.
. mr. nixon. it was sponsored by my colleague from maine . and it was sponsored by distinguished members of the other body. the conception of this bill was that we could give government aid to local voluntary health plans and thus enable them to take care of the problems of those who had low incomes and could  afford to pay the premiums  required for these plans. by some form of government subvention to the voluntary health plans. but without any danger of what some call socialized medicine. because the cooperative plans and those who participated would choose their own physicians just as they do today. a resum6 of the national health act of 1954 is as follows: the proposed national health act of 1954 would amend the already existing public health service act by (a) adding a new title vii which provides an immediate health and medicalservice program. (b) adding a new title viii which provides for a longrange survey of national health needs. (c) expanding existing provisions for hospital construction and adding new provisions for aid to medical and nursing schools. and (d) adding provisions for local public health units.
can the gentleman tell us what happened to those major items in controversy in the house. like the appropriation for nursing homes and other hospital construction and maritime facilities. we have to k that before we vote on the conference report itself.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a letter from the medical society of the county of new york. new york city. embodying a resolution adopted by that society. relating to the inclusion of selfemployed individuals under the social security act.
. i present for appropriate reference and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the recond a resolution adopted by the medical society of ulster county. n. y.. favoring the enactment of legislation to include physicians under the provisions of the social security act.
. i k of the deep feelings of my colleagues who have spoken on the senate floor on the health question. but this is the sort of subject which easily carries us away. we have to make hard decisions. when we vote "yea" on a resolution for war or for sending our troops to korea. it is peaceful and quiet and  bloody on the floor of the senate. but elsewhere i have seen it otherwise. and so have other senators. it is very serious business. i think the senator from oregon is right when he says that we are guarding  only the national security. but the lives and the health of our people. at the same time. our people want us to keep our efforts for national security in the right direction. in the face of the testimony on radioactive fallout which has been given. we might easily be pushed into an abandonment of the tests while what we should try to arrive at is some real balance between security and the protection of the public health. in short. i urge that we be  carried away in either direction. i urge that upon my colleagues. and upon the people of the country. i feel that this is a tense moment. it is the first time in a marked public discussion that we have come to grips with this problem of radioactive fallout. at the same time. it can blind us to the problems of maintaining peace in terms of military security. i think there are equally substantial and strong reasons why we need nuclear tests. in order to keep ourselves abreast of new developments. so while i join both my colleagues in everything they have said. i feel a word of caution must also be addressed to all that we keep a proper balance. and that there should  be an outweighing on either sidebecause of national security wish or health wishon the basis of what has been brought out in public testimony.
i thank the senator from alabama very much. and i wish to commend him personally. i k how hard he has worked on this matter. and what a great contribution he has made to the cause of the american people. in this appropriation bill and otherwise. i would have expected the senator to say what he has said. i feel the dental profession should be tremendously encouraged by the disposition shown by the chairman of the subcommittee. i thank him very much.
. that the article may be printed in the record as a part of my remarks. mr. king points out that there is discrimination or animosity against these arab citizens. he reports that israel has made it possible for its arab citizens to have better schools. better health and welfare services. and far greater prosperity. they enjoy free speech and a free press. they have the right to joint the histadrutthe general labor federationand to enjoy all its social and health benefits. they also have the right to vote and they are represented in the knessetisraels parliamentby eight members of their own choice. the report does  minimize the restrictive measures under which the israel arab must live and which are necessitated by the continuing expressed hostility against israel by arab states surrounding it. mr. king. however. attributes the basic difficulty in integrating the arab citizen to the refusal of many to accept western progress and industrialization. despite all the benefits of political and ecoic democracy which israel makes available. many of israels arabs apparently still hope for the liquidation of the israeli state. the obstacles which mr. king reports that israel officials are trying to overcome are so great as to lend great weight to israels belief th.t largescale repatriation of arab refugees is impossible in the interests of the security of israel.
. i introduce for appropriate reference. a resolution adopted by the medical board and staff of st. josephs hospital. yonkers. n. y.. protesting against the enactment of legislation providing compulsory health insurance. i ask unanimous consent that the resolution may be printed in the record.
 to proclaim the month of march as neighborhood house month. beginning in 1959. and for each following year. since the establishment of the first settlement house in new york citys lower east side in 1886. these institutions have played a vital role in providing essential services to the people of their communities. they function as centers of community activities. culture. fellowship. education in health and ethics. and athletics. as a beneficiary in my youth of settlementhouse training. i k the value of the work done by these organizations among people who need assistance and guidance. the twin objectives of neighborhood houses to strengthen family life and develop better neighborhoods have paid off tremendously in terms of individual development and civic progress. since its beginning in new york in 1886. the settlementhouse movement has grown throughout the united states. so that there are  more than 700 such establishments in almost every city of over 100.000 population in the country. through the national federation of settlements and neighborhood houses. the coordinating agency. these centers carry forward a basic american principle of helping people to help themselves. it is most fitting that the public be made aware. through an annual month set aside for that purpose. of the contributions of the organizations to our society. i believe the people of the country will be much interested.
. it is a great privilege to join in the fine things which are being said today about our colleague. alex smith. i think he ks from long acquaintance with me. both here and in the house of representatives. the warm. personal effection i feel for him and mrs. smith. all of us frequently remember life in terms of symbols. i should like to remind our colleague of two episodes in which senator smith participated. and in which i was a very happy bystander. which will always live with me in the pleasant glow that comes from having kn the senator and having served with him. one incident occurred a long time ago in a hospital outside berlin. i think it goes back to 1947 or 1948. when conditions were very bad there. i was in berlin with the displaced persons committee. senator smith was traveling on a far more august mission for the senate. he presided over a little dinner at harnak house. which was the name of the hospital. at a time when gracious things were hard to come by in wartorn berlin. our dinner table was lighted by candles.  out of choice. but out of necessity. i was then a new representative. and i shall never forget the encouragement to speak up and to discuss my particular mission. to feel at home and friendly. and to be encouraged in what was then. for me. very new work. which this very. very kindly manand i think. senator smith. that that is the most exact characterization which can be made of youdisplayed at that time. then i remember aher hour. when we all sat at lunch in a hotel in chicago during the great convention of 1952. when republican fortunes were hanging in the balance. there. too. senator smith and mrs. smith showed toward me the same kindliness. the same understanding. the same allencompassing tolerance for sharply conflicting personalities and points of view which stood out so markedly. and which i shall never forget. alex these are the things we live by. these are the torches we hold aloft. you have always displayed the same unfailing sweetness of character here on the floor of the senate. whether you agreed or disagreed. it has often seemed hard for you to disagree. so much did you desire to accommodate and to be friendly. however. you were always true to your deep convictions and the interests of the people of the country and of your state. i shall miss you. i only hope that you will return in some other capacity. and that we shall see very often your lumis smile. which is so closely identified with you.
my next question is this. does my colleague from illis agree with me that we are today trying to strengthen the hands of the moderates in the senate who want to comply with the law and do  want local disorder or local flouting of the law. but. to the contrary. want to proceed in an orderly and decent way by civil process. with mediation and conciliation and communication between the races. rather than by other means.
. on behalf of myself. and my colleague. the junior senator from new york . i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to amend the public health service act to require the establishment of a federal narcotics hospital in new york state. representatives victor anfuso. democrat. of new york. and seymour halpern. republican of new york. are introducing identical legislation in the house. the measure stipulates that the u.s. surgeon general may arrange with the state. its political subdivisions. and neighboring states for a jointly operated hospital in new york especially equipped to treat drug addicts. in addition. it provides that "outpatient units" are to be set up to treat persons who are addicted and give followup care after hospitalization. these units could also be financed jointly in cooperation with state and local governments. the federal narcotics bureau reveals that about 45 percent. or some 21.000. of the nations kn narcotic addicts live in the new york metropolitan area. including parts of new jersey and connecticut. medical and police authorities report that 2.707 of these users are juveniles under the age of 21. yet. according to the state bureau of narcotics control. there are hospital beds for adult drug addicts who voluntarily seek treatment anywhere in new york. and only 200 beds for juvenile addicts. the .nearest narcotics hospital is the federal establishment at lexington. ky.. 600 miles away from new york city. these statistics reveal a critical situation which confronts most drug addicts in thern and eastern states. their best chance of getting even a modicum of medical attention enabling them to "shake" the drug habit temporarily rests in admission to a prison hospital ward. and that is where the average addict receives it. at least in new york. to an increasing degree. twenty percent of all prisoners in new york state jails were drug users at the time of their arrest. and last year. of the 4.772 new admissions. the users totaled 1.068. or nearly 23 percent. police departments in several major cities like new york and chicago estimate that as many as onehalf of the crimes committed in their jurisdiction are due to drug addiction. if this correlation is correct. then conceivably 54.000 of new york citys rising rate of 108.358 recorded crimes in 1958 would be attributable to this problem. it is estimated that illicit trade in narcotics and crimes committed by addicts to finance their habit drain the u.s. ecoy of between $300 million and $400 million annually. in recent years. tougher laws and stricter enforcement have led to the arrest and imprisonment of some of the biggest dope smugglers and pushers. however. it is evident that even by calling out the entire army. navy. and air force we shall  eliminate entirely the illegal importation and sale of habitforming drugs. with rising crime rates staring us in the face. we must root out a major cause of criminal activity. drug addiction. that means. according to medical experts. providing special hospital facilities more jail cells or prison bedswhere users of illegal drugs can voluntarily go for help. if a substantial number of addicts are to be cured of the habit for good and more widespread addition leading to more crimes is to be prevented. then these special facilities must be readily accessible for the medical and psychological treatment and rehabilitation deemed absolutely essential by health authorities. the bill introduced today represents a continuation of the major effort undertaken last session by myself. senator ives. congressman anfuso. and others. through legislation and conferences with federal. state. and city officials to open a narcotics hospital in new york. at that time. ellis island was considered as a site. but it was decided the cost of converting and maintaining the plant for that purpose would be prohibitive. however. we were assured by the federal commissioner of narcotics. harry anslinger. that a narcotics hospital established in new york city "would decrease rather than increase the problem of federal narcotics enforcement." "we are  worried about the smuggling of narcotics into the institution." commissioner anslinger reported. the existence of a narcotics hospital and the setting up of "outpatient units" which will provide medical treatment. guidance. and psychological help for former addicts who have been released will be fully utilized in new york even if the legislature does  enact a compulsory commitment law. right . the public health service reports that the typical patient at the federal hospital in lexington. which has a 1.000bed capacity. is a male from the theast. probably new york. who has left his family to travel hundreds of miles to kentucky in the desperate hope of being cured. nevertheless. the average patient there undergoes three to four cures. authorities can force him to remain the 3 or 4 months generally required. but. regardless. once he is back home. exposed to family tensions and the pressures and temptations of his old environment. divorced from medical or psychological treatment. he usually resumes his drug habit shortly thereafter. constant repeaters are the rule.  the exception. although the bill declares the establishment of this narcotics hospital to be mandatory in new york. ample recognition is given the responsibility of new york. its political subdivisions and adjoining states whose addicts might make use of it. to share in the financial costs involved. therefore. the surgeon general is authorized to enter into joint agreements with them concerning the operation of both the hospital and the outpatient units. shifting our main emphasis to an allout medical attack on widespread drug addiction. backed up with laws requiring compulsory hospitalization of drug addicts. will prove a much less expensive and more effective approach to a practical and humane solution to a problem which nationwide directly involves 45.000 reported addicts in the united states and their families.
. i ask unanimous consent that the name of the senator from massachusetts may be added as one of the cosponsors of the joint resolution (s.j. res. 43) to establish the health services study commission. introduced by me on
. on february 4. i introduced for myself and senator keating a bill for the establishment of a narcotics hospital in new york state. to be jointly operated by the federal government. the state of new york and neighboring states that wish to participate. this bill is similar to one which senator ives and i introduced in 1958. representatives anfuso and halpern have put forward identical legislation in the house. the establishment of such a hospital would represent an attempt at coping with the problem of narcotics addiction by going to its medical and psychological roots. the article by edward t. mancuso. public defender in the city and county of san francisco. published in the february issue of frontier. clearly and concisely states some of the reasons why such an attempt should be made. this is one of our most serious and frustrating problems. my colleague and i are urging. through a bill. that a new narcotics facility be opened in the city of new york. i invite my colleagues attention to the article which i have inserted in the record by way of bearing out the urgent character of the problem in the metropolitan area. which. i have the ho. in part. to represent.
. i. too. am a member of the committee which developed this legislation. and i was hoed to join as a sponsor of it. but i think it is important for my colleagues to k that the very questions which are being raised on the floor were  only raised in committee. but were determined factually by the witnesses who testified before us. rather than to add to the very eloquent pleas which have already been made for the legislation. in principle. by the chairman of the committee and by the senator from minnesota . by my colleague from kentucky . and my colleague from new york . i wish to call attention to certain specifics in the record. senators will find. as shown on page 43 of the record. that i questioned dr. rusk. from my own city of new york. he is a very distinguished authority on vocational rehabilitation. i questioned him as to why we could  entrust this program to the surgeon *general. and why we had to have a special institute. also why we could  use counterpart funds. of which we have hundreds of millions in the world. and why we had to have dollars. dr. rusk answered those questions by pointing out. first. that it was  only necessary for us to send scientists abroad who could use counterpart funds in foreign countries. but it was also essential to bring those scientists here to work with our equipment and our scientists. in order to get the best results from international cooperation. dollars would be required for their living expenses. and also for certain types of equipment. second. referring to the surgeon generals activity. he said: i think if it is scattered through all of the institutes here. it will be diluted out and lost for the reason i gave. that priority for those should first go to u.s. institutions. he points out that if we gave priority to the surgeon general. we could  include the work of the office of vocational rehabilitation and the childrens bureau. there are practical and distinct reasons for adopting the administrative machinery contained in the joint resolution. and for providing specific dollar amounts in order to facilitate this activity. it so happened that one of the witnesses before the committee was a very distinguished doctor. a leader in research. with whom i had the ho to serve in the army during world war ii. i refer to dr. cornelius p. rhoads. medical director of the sloankettering institute. probably the worlds leading medical institute engaged in cancer research. dr. rhoads. with whom i had personal experience when he was medical director of the chemical corps in world war ii. and i served as a staff officer. is in my opinion one of the most astute and capable medical administrators living today. he has a great consciousness and a deep understanding of the massing of research means upon the solution of medical problems. although we have  yet found a cure for cancer. after the manner of the great historic achievement of dr. jonas salk with respect to polio. we have made major progress in many fields of cancer. many people are being saved today who in earlier days would  have been saved. a great deal of that advance comes from the sloankettering institute. this is the most expert kind of testimony. there is greater killer than cancer. in terms of a curable disease. ultimately the world will weep with anguish when a cure is found for cancer. which is a unit disease. susceptible to attach by research means. we may say that heart disease involves all kinds of strains and varieties. but cancer is a unit disease. which we can conquer. dr. rhoads is the very top authority in the field. he is  only a thorough believer in massing research means to solve individual medical problems. but he testified before the committee on the efficacy of massing international research means. which he said could  be done without legislation of this character. for the reasons which he stated in his testimony. it seems to me that if only for that reason. if only for the massive attack upon cancer in a worldwide way. if hing else were involved. with only the faintest hope that a little faster progress could be made by the investment of even the entire sum authorized. $50 million. i doubt if any member of the senate. whatever may be our domestic needs. would feel morally justified in voting against the project.
i am grateful to my colleague. . again i submit that at a time when we are trying to build bridges  only of understanding. but also of working together in a practical way for the benefit of mankind. what more durable. what more effective way could there be than through the medical sciences. when there is cooperation available in those sciences. i k of few measures which have ever come before us which should give us greater gratification in voting for than this one. to my colleague from new hampshire and to other senators who are concerned about local needs. i say. how much better will local needs be served if by employing effectivelyand it is obvious that we are  employing them effectivelythe scientific resources. we can bring by one day or one month or one year sooner the time when we can deal effectively with cancer. in my view the costs. relative to the results. are so small as to be unworthy of our serious discussion.
. the communal responsibility. the feeling of the man for his fellow man. came to the fore. this is the paama of a lifetime.  merely episodes which opponents pick upon in respect of a rather heated series of hearings which extended over a period of 3 months. but it is a lifetime upon which we  are casting the spotlight. and when given the opportunity strauss showed the finest instincts rather than the basest instincts. i think that fact has got to be most seriously evaluated in deciding whether the man has suddenly been transformed from a dr. jekyll to a mr. hyde. as the miity in this question would have us believe. he was particularly interested in cancer research. especially after the death of his mother from that disease. he financed the construction of a surge generator at the california institute of techogy for the purpose of producing radioactive isotopes for the treatment of cancer. he is a director of memorial hospital in new york. incidentally. in that connection. as aher fact showing his humanity. as aher bit of the human side of the news. if you will. it became his sad duty to tell robert taft that his illness was fatal.
i e on page 7 of the report that action has been deferred by the committee on the question of including already retired federal employees and their dependents in the program contemplated by senate bill 2162. and that the committee intends to study this matter independently. has this study as yet been scheduled. is it contemplated that proposed legislation will be the result of the study. or that a report on the findings will be submitted to the senate. i should like to add. . that in the statement which i had submitted to the committee. i urged the inclusion of already retired federal employees in a government employee health program. i am aware of some of the technical difficulties with which the committee was faced in connection with including such retired employees in the program under this bill. i trust that the committee will give favorable consideration to this proposal. during the studies which it contemplates making. so i ask the chairman of the committee whether the study has been scheduled. and whether it is contemplated that proposed legislation resulting from the study will be submitted to the senate.
. i should like to join my colleagues in wishing good health and happiness to our friend and colleague. senator green. of rhode island. to his colleagues in the senate he is a joy and an inspiration. his example is an indication that there must be something about the air in this chamber which gives men a zest for living and enjoyment in dealing with the nations problems. if they but k how to deal with them. the senator from rhode island ks how to do it. i congratulate him for his hoed presence in this chamber for so many years.
. today the world celebrates the 85th birthday of albert schweitzer. missionarydoctor. scholar. philosopher. musician. and humanist. dr. schweitzer has won universal acclaim because of his work. and his career has been devoted to the service of his fellow men. from the heart of africa. where in 1913. he founded a mission hospital which today has become a great healthgiving center in which more than 500 patients are treated each month. his spirit has radiated to all parts of the world. he has written: it seems to me a matter of course that we should all take our share of the burden of pain which lies upon the world. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record. as a part of my remarks. editorials on dr. schweitzers birthday. which were printed today in the new york herald tribune and the washington post.
 nassers commitments than has heretofore been apparent whatever is being said behind the scenes. i ask unanimous consent that the dispatch in the new york times. january 21. 1960. headlined "u.s. contract aids boycott of israel" and the editorial entitled "moscow and cairo." also in the new york times. january 21. 1960. be printed at this point in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the nassau county. n.y.. american legion. favoring the enactment of legislation to establish a veterans hospital for nassau and suffolk counties.
. by reading the concurrent resolution. it is very brief. whereas in recent days there has been a wave of desecration of places of worship and other sacred sites. and whereas this desecration has been spreading throughout the nations of europe and other parts of the world. and whereas instances of desecration have occurred in this country recently. and whereas. if left unchecked. this wave can only result in grievous moral deterioration and denial of the true spirit of the brotherhood of man. and whereas the conscience of the world has been shocked by these events: . therefore. be it resolved by the senate (the house of representatives concurring). that the congress hereby expresses its profound sense of indignation and shock at this epidemic of desecration and calls upon all persons and governments throughout the world to exert their energies to the end that these shameful events shall  recur.
. i move  to aher aspect of the dirksen amendment in thd nature of a substitute. the proposed socalled antibombing legislation. again. i emphasize that in the course of these debates it is so easy to forget what is taking place in the world. let us remember that there has been a series of the most trying and dangerous acts of disorder and coercion against individuals in some of the southern states. indeed. my colleague the senator from new york had the initiative during his campaign in 1958 to suggest that he would actually go to the southern states where the bombings had taken place. he was gracious egh to invite me to accompany him so that we might inspect what had occurred and talk with the governmental officials who were functioning in those areas. we did that. when we returned. we were of one mind that the law  proposed was absolutely necessary. such a bill has languished in pigeonholes ever since 1958. withstanding the fact that this danger still stalks the land.
again the senator refers to the degree of balance between the federal and state governments. and i should like to point out to the senator that the federal government did send troops into little rock to suppress a situation of disorder and anarchy. but even the great heroes of the southern states. like some of our former presidents. were compelled to use federal troops in situations of this character. in the south and elsewhere. when problems had gotten beyond the control of local officials. again. this is one of the prices which the state pays for the federal union. and this involves the balance of powers we all talk about. we accordingly accept it as part of our great democracy. and that is what i am talking about in regard to this voting legislation.
the senator ks very well. being a very competent lawyer. just what are the requirements for the invocation of the federal power with respect to public disorder or anarchy in a particular community. i think i have made my views on that subject very clear. the senator ks. as well as i do. that we can make the generic decisions such as he would like to have me make upon this subject. because it depends strictly upon the extent to which public order is broken down and whether it has reached the point where the constitutional authority of the united states would be properly applicable.
i am very grateful to my colleague. who has joined. in his typically gracious way. in this tribute to mrs. levy. i k i speak for both of us when i extend our heartfelt sympathy to dr. david levy. a gifted physician in new york. and to her family. mrs. levy came from the rosenwald family. which is one of the most distinguished families in philanthropic works of great benefit to the people. it has been our good fortune to have had her among us.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record two resolutions. one adopted by the town board of the town of rotterdam. n.y.. relating to additional scholarships in the field of science and engineering. and the second adopted by the medical society of montgomery county. n.y.. relating to governmental control of the practice of medicine.
 of the united states as the way in which largescale registration. and therefore largescale voting. could be accomplished." that would be so  because there would be wholesale qualifications where qualifications were  deserved. the law is very clear that it is state qualifications which apply. and  federal qualifications. the effort proceeded on the proposition that the wrong had been so widespread and long enduring that it took a remedy greater than that which was offered to us by the attorney general. therefore. that group. and others on this side of the aisle with a like mind. presented a prescription to the senate for that purpose. the plan of the civil rights commission. the senate in its wisdom determined to turn that down. whether we could have had 8 or 10 or 15 more votes if other members of the senate who were absent had been present is an academic question. the fact is that a majority of the senate turned the proposition down. therefore. we came to the judgment that we should make this proposal before we came to the regrettable conclusion that there was other alternative than the referee planwhich is a limited alternative. indeed. i read the words of my colleague from pennsylvania on that subject. wrung from his heart. because this is a subject on which we feel deeply. he said if he had to do it. if that was the only alternative. he would vote for the referee plan with a heavy heart.
. the medical society of the state of new york and the medical societies of nassau county. cortland county. rensselaer county. wyoming county. new york county. nassau county. ulster county. montgomery county. and monroe county. and also the womens auxiliaries of the medical societies of nassau county. monroe county. albany county. tompkins county. schenectady county. and herkimer county. all in the state of new york. memorialize the congress regarding their opposition to the bill to amend the social security act and the internal revenue code so as to provide insurance against the costs of hospital. nursing home. and surgical service for persons eligible for oldage and survivors insurance benefits. and for other purposes. i ask unanimous consent that the memorials may be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a series of resolutions adopted by organizations in the state of new york protesting against the enactment of house bill 4700. the forand bill. relating to medical care for the aged.
. i introduce for appropriate reference. for myself. the senator from kentucky . the senator from pennsylvania . the senior senator from vermont . the senator from new jersey . the senator from hawaii . my colleague the junior senator from new york . and the junior senator from vermont . a bill to establish a voluntary health care program under which the states could provide health insurance coverage for all persons aged 65 and over. and their spouses. cooperative health programs or private health insurance plans would be the means through which the state plans would provide such coverage to include physicians care in home and offlce. diagtic services. hospitalization and nursing home care.
entitled the "health insurance for the aged act." the bill is a public health measure and is  linked to the social security system. it could potentially reach any one of the nearly 16 million americans over 65 wishing to participate. including 4 to 5 million who are  eligible under social security. under this voluntary program. every person 65 or over living in a state participating in the act and the husband or wife of this person. regardless of age. could enroll in a program providing good. basic health coverage. it has been estimated that the bill will permit states to provide up to $10.000 in health care insurance during the lifetime of subscribers for a maximum premium cost of $2.184. when the individuals need for adequate health care exceeds his income. it is entirely appropriate that the federal and state governments participate to help him to meet the premium cost. a fundamental principle of this program is that of assisting the aged in need of health care where necessary. human dignity is a priceless possession. and the average u.s. citizen expects to pay to the best of his ability for the necessities of life. to receive approval by the secretary of health. education. and welfare. every state plan under our bill would have to offer subscribers a choice of at least two types of health insuranceone a "service benefits" plan in whole or in part and the other an "indemnity benefits" plan. generally. a "service plan" would provide 60 days of full cost. semiprivate hospital care or the equivalent cost care in a nursing home for the aged and make satisfactory provision for surgery both in and out of the hospital. hospital medical care. visits to the doctors office. along with necessary laboratory tests. diagtic xrays. specialist consultations. and visiting nurse service in the home. legislation to provide health care for our "senior citizens" ranks as a major domestic issue in the united states. enactment of a measure to assure our older citizens that the modern medical advances in health servicesincluding hospitalization. medical and surgical techniques. new drugs. and skilled home nursing and physicians carewill be available to them at an age when they need them most frequently is urgently required. this nation has long since progressed beyond the point when any segment of the population should find that physical distress must be endured because of financial inability to bear medical care costs singlehanded. under the terms of the bill. monthly subscription fees for individuals would range from 50 cents to $13. depending on the subscribers income. the difference between the total subscription paid by beneficiaries and the full premium cost would be shared by the state and the federal government. the federal contribution would be based on a formula used in the hillburton hospital construction act. under which the federal governments share to the states ranges from a maximum of 75 percent to a minimum of 331/3 percent. based on the likelihood that 70 percent of those eligible will join the plan because the others are carried  in a suitable health plan. or for other reasons. the estimated median average cost per year of this program to the federal government. based on expected allocations by states. would be about $480 million. to the states $640 million. and $400 million to the subscribers. the cost to the federal government in succeeding years should increase only a little. if at all. because a progressively smaller proportion of those reaching 65 will fall into the lowest income categories. this type of program also lends itself to progressive improvement through a combination of voluntary subscription. public subsidy. and cooperation of the voluntary health insurance system. the cost to the federal government and the benefits under our bill show the desirability of this bill as compared with the forand bill or other compulsory health plans before this congress to be financed through the social security system. the outstanding characteristics of the "health insurance for the aged act" are that it is a voluntary program complementing rather than competing with the efforts of private health insurance carriers and cooperative health programs to provide adequate coverage to an age group which essentially lies in the "high risk" category. it minimizes federal direction by requiring that the states draw up programs based on available health care facilities and realistic health needs and medical expenditure patterns of the aged population within its own borders. while meeting federal standards. and it sets a congenial "need" criteria in the provision of federal grants to the states with more help for those with the smallest per capita incomes. the bill recognizes that while hospitalization costs may comprise a large part of an aged persons annual medical bill. the average older couple spends $140 a year on health costs unrelated to hospitalization. one out of every six persons 65 and older pays over $500 in medical bills annually. sixty percent of those over 65 have an annual income of under $1.000. and often can afford home or office care by a doctor which might appreciably cut down the length of hospitalization required and in some cases eliminate it altogether when a condition is caught in the early stages. therefore. legislation limited to hospitalization and nursing care only may unnecessarily strain such facilities and be inadequate to the task of providing adequate basic health coverage for the aged. when the controversial ewing plan was introduced in the late 1940s. it was labeled socialized medicine and republicans. including myself. introduced the national health act which utilized the existing private and cooperative plans to provide health care nationally. medical care for the aged was a part of the overall problem.  it is becoming urgent standing by itself. at that time. we had about 12 million citizens 65 and older. today the number has risen to nearly 16 million and by 1970 it will stand at nearly 20 million. there seems little doubt that the most logical point at which to begin raising national health standards is by devising a voluntary program such as this one consistent with the private relation between doctor and patient which will still provide adequate health protection to the aged with the participation of the state and federal governments. . i am grateful to my colleague. who is cosponsoring the bill. for allowing me to proceed.
subsequently said: . i ask unanimous consent that the bill . to provide for a program of federal matching grants to the states to enable the states to provide health insurance for individuals aged 65 or over at subscription charges such individuals can pay. which i introduced earlier today. may remain at the desk until the close of the session on wednesday next. april 13. so as to afford other senators an opportunity to cosponsor it.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the western new york accident & health association. inc.. of buffalo. n.y.. relating to increased benefits for the aged. under the social security act.
. the cause of mental health is attracting increasing concern and attention throughout the country. the mounting strains placed upon the individual by our increasingly complex civilization have made the problems emous in getting under way comprehensive programs to combat mental illness. i call attention to a proclamation issued by gov. nelson a. rockefeller of new york proclaiming may 1 to 7 as mental health week. and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
. i annce to the senate the death today of john d. rockefeller. jr.. the father of the gover of new york. and of five other children. mrs. jean mauze. john d.. iii. laurence s.. winthrop. and david. who have made their mark in the philanthropic. ecoic. and cultural life of our nation. he and mrs. rockefeller established an outstanding family with a great tradition. john d. rockefeller. jr.. and the elder rockefeller. contributed almost a billion dollars to philanthropy. john d. rockefeller. jr.. was a very eminent citizen of my state of new york and made an outstanding record in war work. he helped to found the united services organization. he was especially distinguished in the field of personal relationships in industry. and was the author of the book "the personal relation in industry." john d. rockefeller. jr.. was especially outstanding in the field of medical research. having served as a trustee of the rockefeller institute for medical research from 1901 to 1954. mr. rockefeller lived a good. fruitful. long life. he established the tremendously important and eminent family tradition of utilizing wealth for the highest purposes of public service. his death will be felt by the people of america. indeed. his passing will be mourned by people everywhere. he was an hoed. distinguished. and most useful citizen of our state and nation. i express my condolences and sympathy to the family. and particularly to the gover of our state. the hoable nelson rockefeller.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the board of supervisors of erie county. n.y.. favoring the enactment of legislation to provide medical care for elderly citizens.
. i present. for appropriate reference. and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. a resolution adopted by the common council of the city of buffalo. n.y.. favoring the enactment of legislation to provide medical care for the aged.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. and appropriately referred. a resolution adopted by the board of supervisors of putnam county. carmel. n.y.. favoring the enactment of the forand bill. to provide medical care for the aged.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would make federal aid available to help states meet the cost of caring for drug addicts based on compulsory commitment to a hospital. similar legislation has been introduced in the house of representatives by representative victor anruso. the curse of narcotics addiction is the inability to effect cures. so often narcotics addiction is a life sentence to torment and crime. to have any real progress in helping narcotic addicts effect permanent cures. the federal government must assume a greater share of responsibility in helping the states provide adequate medical care in proper hospital facilities. this proposed legislation would call for a $2 million appropriation the first year to be used as grantsinaid for the payment of half the cost per bed patient in the case of drug addicts in closed institutions. thereafter congress would determine the funds required. it is secret that the "repeater" rate on addicts is fantastically high. according to the records of the federal narcotics hospital in lexington. ky.. with patients returning three. four. and more times for treatment. but the addicts who would receive medical help under the bill i am introducing today would have a far better chance of making a longterm recovery for these reasons: first. the federal funds will help pay for the hospital treatment of those addicts who have been committed through a state civil action which requires them to undergo treatment until released "as having attained maximum medical benefits." since last april. new york state. which has nearly half of the countrys over 40.000 kn addicts. has had a new law on its books providing for the compulsory detention of drug addicts for periods of up to 12 months in any state hospital equipped to give them care and treatment. and in addition. new yorks legislature appropriated $300.000 for a new program to operate facilities for the care. treatment. cure. and rehabilitation of these patients. addicts will  be able to leave voluntarily before being cured. second. the hospitals where addicts can be treated will be accessible to themthere will be need to travel hundreds of miles to lexington. ky.. and the federal hospital there where commitment is voluntary. some states like new york have ed a decline in the number of patients in mental hospitals and are  able to devote more of their resources to finding an effective and permanent place of treatment for narcotic addiction. for decades. the emphasis has been placed on the stringent enforcement of laws to wipe out the illegal trade in drugs and cut off the addicts source of supply. despite the efforts of federal. state. and local officials. the number of the nations addicts continues to increase. therefore. without further delay all levels of government should combine forces to tackle the broadscale medical aspects of drug addiction. thousands of addicts.  outcasts of society. may be rescued from the scourge of addiction and become useful. responsible citizens again if the right kind of hospital treatment is made available.
. i ask unanimous consent that the name of the senator from kentucky may be added as an additional cosponsor of senate bill 3680. the health facilities and training act of 1960. introduced by me. for myself and the senator from new jersey . on june 16. 1960.
when i appeared before the committee i made the point about the thport. long island. veterans hospital. of which. i k. the senator has heard a great deal. it is one of the largest neuropsychiatric hospitals in the veterans administration system. it is located at thport. long island. it is greatly overcrowded. we have the word of the area medical director at boston. francis b. carroll. in substantiation of that statement. i laid the facts before the committee. my statement is found at page 612 of the committee hearings. i k that the chairman is just as much interested in veterans as i am. and i am making invidious implications of any kind. i should like to ask the chairman whether or  we may hope that the committee will cause its staff to take a long. hard look at this situation in order to see whether the veterans administration should  be stirred into doing something about it.
. i ask unanimous consent that the name of the senator from massachusetts may be added as a cosponsor of the bill to improve the public health through revising. consolidating. and improving hospital and other medical facilities provisions of the public health service act. authorizing grants for construction of medical. dental. osteopathic. and public health teaching facilities. providing special project grants for postgraduate public health training. providing for federal guarantee of loans for construction of group practice medical or dental care facilities. and for other purposes. introduced by me (for myself and mr. case of new jersey) on june 16. 1960.
. i send to the desk. for printing. under the rule. an amendment to the socalled social security bill relating to medical care for the aged. on that subject. i make the following statement: the senate may recall that. together with a group of other senators on this side of the aisle. i introduced a bill in the nature of a substitute for. or an alternative to. the socalled forand plan for medical care to the aged. this amendment in the nature of a substitute makes certain revisions of a major character in the bill we previously introduced. and in my opinion this amendment will have a major impact. as a very plausible substitute. upon the bill from the other body. which  is awaiting action by us. the principal changes which this amendment calls for include. first. the establishment of a minimum schedule of health insurance benefits to be provided subscribers by the states. second. authorization of the states to determine the schedule of fees to be paid by a subscriber for health insurance. as determined by the subscribers income. orand this is very importantto require fees at all. and. third. permission for a state to act as its own insurance carrier. as an alternative to having insurance coverage provided by profit service agencies and private or profit insurance carriers under contract with a state agency. the important features of this amendment are that it guarantees a minimum of benefits. as follows: first. physicians services for 12 home or office visits. second. 21 days of hospital or equivalent nursing home care. the first $100 of costs for ambulatory diagtic laboratory and xray services. and. fourth. 24 visitingnurses home service visits. as prescribed by a physicianand all of these each year. the important point is that this schedule of benefits can be provided free of charge to those over 65 years of age. and it would cost all participating governmental entities $840 million a year. this means that the cost of participation to the federal government would be approximately $400 million a year. hence. our plan is entirely feasible from the point of view of federal expenditures. as a voluntary plan outside the social security system. and yet with charge to any subscriber if a state chooses to make e. but if a state chooses to provide greater benefits. our amendment in the nature of a substitute will allow a joint federalstate subscriber plan. too. it seems to us that this measure gives such flexibility in dealing with the entire problem of medical care for the aged as to make completely unnecessary the social security approach. particularly in view of the manifest disadvantageswhich have been referred to many timesof that approach. which would put on an openend basis the entire program of medical care for the aged. with end in sight. and would make it comparable to the scheme in the united kingdom. which is  adaptable to our country. i refer particularly to the fact. as ed yesterday in the newspapers. that 127 million americans are  covered by some kind of health insurance. to junk all of that. rather than build upon it. would seem to me to be most ill advised. of course. we shall have an opportunity to debate all these matters. i ask unanimous consent that i may have printed at this point a news release on this subject:
. i ask unanimcfus consent that there may be incorporated as a part of my remarks an analysis of the health insurance bill sponsored by myself and my colleagues as amended today by the document which i have sent to the desk.
. it is eworthy when an american shipping company achieves such excellence of performance as to warrant awards by the u.s. government. such a development has just taken place for the united states lines co.. which has been cited by the public health service for most satisfactory results in vessel sanitation. the special citation was presented because each of the 57 vessels operated by the united states lines achieved a rating of 95 or higher on an official public health service inspection involving 166 separate items of sanitary construction and maintenance. particularly eworthy is this recognition of highly satisfactory service to the traveling public because united states lines is receiving the award for the fourth consecutive year. the previous citations were awarded in january 1957. may 1958. and september 1959.
. i should like to have the attention of both senators from alaska in connection with this bill. which was discussed in the committee of which i am a member. i raised some objections to it. but i think they can be adjusted on the floor of the senate with the senators from alaska. at any rate. i hope so. as i understand. the bill involves a very small number of casesmy understanding is only nine. for the information of the senate. the bill proposes that the veterans administration shall pay for the hospitalization of veterans with serviceconnected disabilities in certain hospitals in alaska. because there are veterans administration facilities there. - apparently. this was the practice of the veterans administration in alaska before it became a state. the idea is to legalize that practice  that it is a state. i ask the senators from alaska to answer these two points: first. this proposal concerns only nine veterans. or thereaboutsi will  tie down the senators to the number nine as any magic figure. second. it is an authorization. it is  a direction. my reason for raising both the points is this: this proposal represents a distinction in treatment between veterans in other states and veterans in alaska. veterans in other states who have serviceconnected disabilities can get hospitalization unless beds are available. whereas in alaska they can obtain such hospitalization. because apparently that has been the practice. under the terms of the bill. they would be assured of hospitalization in the future. the bill does represent a difference between the way in which veterans in alaska are treated and the way in which other veterans are treated. however. i shall  object to the bill. because i think there is something to be said for the doctrine of what we lawyers call de minimis.  a great deal is involved. and a certain practice has been followed in alaska. personally i would  want to feel that i was standing in the way of it. but i do wish to be sure. first. that the number is small. and second. that the bill involves an authorization. and  a mandate. so if there is any abuse in the future.  only may the administrator come back and tell us about it. but i should like to express the hope. in which i trust the sponsors of the bill will join. that he will come back and tell us about it. he should come and tell us about it.
my only reason for expressing myself is that i believe these expressions of opinion are necessary in order to determine what we shall do. i join with the senator from alabama and the senator from wisconsin in affirmation of the point that we can and should finish our work before the conventions. the senate and house have shown remarkable capability in turning out an emous amount of business when they get their teeth into it. also. if egh of us are willing. it is very likely that we will accomplish our goal. that will depend on the amount of extended discussion which takes place. i think the overwhelming majority of the senate are anxious to complete the business at hand. i think the minimum wage. the medical care for the aged. the housing. and the education bills are the most important bills on which we must act before we adjourn. there are disadvantages to returning in august. when the presidential candidates will be facing each other. and perhaps right here in the senate. there are disadvantages to meeting in ember. because then everything can be laid over until january. the time for the beginning of the next session will be so close that it will be easy to drag the proceedings along. this is the time to do our business. i join with the senator from wisconsin. the senator from alabama. and my colleague from new york in their excellent analysis in this respect.
. i move to reconsider the vote by which the senate yesterday concurred in the amendment of the house to s. 2197. to protect the public health by amending the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act. on that motion. i ask recognition.
i thank the senator from illis. i point out that the assurance the senator from illis has just given us. and which i hope very much will be joined in by the chairman of the committee. the senator from alabama . is a caveat to our own agency to apply the rule of reason in terms of public health and safety. but at the same time we do  want the application of the law to "go overboard". we wish it to be fair. so i have moved that the vote by which the amendment was agreed to be reconsidered. in order to afford an opportunity to make a matter of record this position on the part of the government agencies.
. will the senator from alabama then join in the assurance given by the distinguished senator from illis . namely. that. fully consistent with health and safetyand all of us are absolutely committed to guarding and safeguarding them in every possible way. he. too. feels that the legislative record here should show clearly that the recommendation as to the application of the rule of reason by the enforcing agency is expected to be applied.
i ask this question very seriously. and i am very seriously interested in the senators response to it: does the senator regard the civil rights issue as equal in importance to the issue of medical care for the aged and the other issues the senator says we have been brought here to deal with.
. the question before us  really is how shall we do it.  whether we shall do it at all. if there was any question about this. it was settled in the policy planks adopted at the recent national conventions by both parties. the republican party is pledged to the adoption of a contributory health program for the aged with federal aid to give protection against burdensome costs of health care. and with the beneficiaries having the option of purchasing private health insurance. the democratic party pledge calls for the use of the contributory machinery of the social security system to cover hospitalization and other high cost medical services. today. i wish to describe the amendment i have sent to the desk. to be printed and to lie on the table. i hope to call up the amendment before i conclude my remarks. it is submitted by me. and is jointly sponsored by eight other senators i have named. and i believe our amendment is the best means for accomplishing at this session federal aid for health care for our older citizens. in that connection. i emphasize the words "at this session." the principles of this amendment are incorporated in the bill introduced by me. with senators
that is true. but is it  also true that then we would get into the range of people who are generally covered. remember that there are 127 million people covered by various types of health insurance. and we do  expect the federal government to shepherd them all. i point out to the senator that i think the senator is making entirely valid points. and that the senator is correct actuarially speaking. that the overwhelming majority of those over 65 come within the $3.000 and the $4.500 limits. the exclusion at the most is something within the area of about 214 million maximum.
this question was bound to come up. and we might as well answer it. it is. of course. a fact. that the govers want to shed themselves of as much of the cost as they can. that is very understandable. they would like to use the money for other things. if they have it. so we can understand their position. we wrestle with it every day in the week. they want more money here and they want to spend less themselves. with respect to gover rockefeller. he has annced his position as favoring the social security approach. with one very important exception. which is  in the anderson substitute. perhaps it will be some day. but it is  in the substitute . he is in favor of the social security approach if it gives the individual subscriber the option of getting his money in cash. so that he may subscribe to a private health plan. he has made that point very clear. i speak of it so strongly because he made it clear to me. this is an issue upon which he and i do  see eye to eye. there are very few such issues. gover rockefeller and i are in great agreement. certainly as great as anybody has with him. he is in favor of the social security approach. and has said so. i respect him for his views. although i may  agree with them. he has pointed out that he is only for it if it gives the subscriber or the beneficiary the cash option. otherwise. he is  in favor of it.
i am grateful to the senator from wisconsin. there is hing which brings out a case better than questions. he is very able. he and i have debated this question on television. i have enjoyed our debates very much. his performance here is well worthy of him. i should like to proceed  to a conclusion of my remarks. very briefly. i had in mind pointing out what i am sure others will point out. namely. the reason why this subject has become a great problem and a great issue in this country. since 1957. medical care costs have gone up more than 20 percent. when we remember what our older citizens must pay for medical care with what they earn. we can understand why this is burgeoning  only as a political problem. but also as an ecoic and social problem. our older citizens. according to a 195758 study. spent. on the average. $177 a year for health and medical expenses. compared with $84 spent on the average by the rest of the population. however. 16 percent of the older citizens had to spend as much as $500 a year for their health care. we must remember. also. and must take into account the factand i am deeply convinced of thisthat our older citizens are  getting the medical care they ought to be getting. they ought to be spending more than the already high amounts. however. these higher expenses come at a time when the earning power of the men and women in this group has declined so sharply that 60 percent. or 9.6 million. in this group have less than a thousand dollars a year to live on. while - 80 percent. or 12.8 million. have incomes of $2.000 a year or less. it seems to me that under these circumstances we are bound to do something about this situation. - before i conclude i should like to make - one further point. which is so important - to this whole debate. and that is this: k what is the program which is proportioned to what our older citizem need. why is it 60 days in the hospital. and  30 days. why is it 180 days. and  365 days. what do the older citizens really need. in that respect i point to a u.s. national health survey entitled "hospitalizationpatients discharged from short stay hospitals." published in june 1958. it shows why the program which i am proposing with my cosponsors is so valuable and so clearly proportioned to the need. it shows that less than 10 percent of the 16 million aged citizens who are hospitalized9.8 percent to be exactactually need to stay more than 31 days per year in the hospital. ninety percent do  require long hospital stays. u.s. government statistics show that the average hospital stay of this latter group is 14 days. with the general average stay being 21 days. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record as a part of my remarks a table showing the percentage of participation under my amendment by the various states with the federal government. i have previously secured unanimous consent to have printed in the record a chart analyzing the cost of the minimummaximum package.
i did  make the statement with any intention of shutting off the senator. if any questions occur to the senator. as he hears me make comments. i ask him to forget about saturday. that is hard work. if the senator will simply ask me questions. i shall be glad to try to answer. i really feel very deeply about this proposal. in fairness to myself. though it may seem odd to the senator that the approach advertised as the liberal approach is one with which i do  find myself in accord on this issue. i explain it as follows: i have been interested in this subject for a long time. i introduced a bill upon this question in 1949. with the cosponsorship. interestingly egh. of the vice president. who was then a member of the house of representatives. of the secretary of the state. who was then a member of the house of representatives. of the chairman of the republican national committee. who was then a member of the house of representatives. of the senator from new jersey . who was then a member of the house of representatives. and of the senator from pennsylvania . who was then a member of the house of representatives. the bill which was introduced adopted exactly the principle which is  contained in my proposal. which the administration has adopted. over all the years i have received a great deal of correspondence. i have engaged in a great many conferences. and i have done a great deal of research. on the matter. i have been on many television programs. on which i have been sharply crossexamined on the subject.  content with that. with the enthusiastic cooperation of the college of physicians and surgeons. i sponsored and conducted a seminar on medical care for the aged at the college of physicians and surgeons of columbia university the past spring. all of these discussions and ideasall of this fact gatheringover the years has led me to have some rather deep feelings upon this subject in terms of what i think is the proper way to accomplish what we desire. in addition. i have had to answer to myself. to my own conscience. in terms of this issue. as to what is the proper way to proceed. i wish to state. in fairness to my colleagues in the senate. the fundamental rationale which has animated me in the matter. i feel there is a very real and very important sociological question involved in extending the social security system to include medical care. i do  make these remarks in terms of "getting the camels e under the tent." but i make them very seriously. matter what we may do  with respect to the anderson amendment. with its very limited benefits schedule and very strict conditions about agefor example. age 68this represents an important departure in national policy. we are opening up the social security system to a new concept. to a new purpose of health care. which i think puts us essentially in a national health scheme. it is bound to go further. perhaps it will be extended to all social security recipients. whatever may be their ages. we are starting a system. a form of organization. a type of approach to medical care needs. which i think will take firm root as a new departure in american life. if i were convinced that is the only way to do itsince i am absolutely convinced we must have federal legislation for the agedthen i think i would be in favor of it. perhaps i am too much of an egghead for my own good. but my difficulty is that i have been unable to be convinced that there is  a way to do this which is quite consistent with the pattern with which we have run our affairs up to . to satisfy fully everything one wishes to do so far as medical care for the aged is concerned. without going into the rather new sociological approach for us. which. in our country. does seem to be running counter to the grain of the way our people like to handle their medical care. their relationships with doctors and hospitals. i do  k whether this is the result of the size of our country or the result of the nature of our people. who are  as homogeneous as the british. i think the social security approach will take us out of the mainstream of american life. in all fairness. this is the rationale of my thinking. obviously. i have deep feelings. obviously. i have thought about the subject a great deal. because i have been living with the problem for a long time. in a sense. the whole thing has caught up with me. rather than me catching up with it. i explain that to my colleague. because i have so much deep feeling about the matter.
i wish to make this clear. because the senator is entitled to the benefit of whatever it means. exactly. from the recent past the senator ks. matter what may happen. of my devotion to the gover of my state. who i think is a very great citizen and whom i backed when many people thought i was foolhardy to do so. he and i do  agree on this matter as to the social security aspect. but i should like to point out. in fairness to him. that he. too. has a very important qualification with respect to the social security approach. he says that he wishes to follow the social security approach. but he desires an alternative. which is for the recipient to have cash. so that the recipient may buy health insurance or coverage if he so chooses. this is a very important alternative. gover rockefeller thinks that this alternative changes completely the basic principle of what is advocated in the anderson amendment. he may be incorrect. but. as i have said. that is what he thinks. i k that. because i have had discussions with him myself. the senator is absolutely correct and is entitlg to all the benefit which comes to his argument from the fact that my own gover. for whom i have so much regard. whom i backed so assiduously for so long. believes the social security approach is the better approach. with the important difference between his concept and the anderson amendmentthis is  in the anderson amendment. and it may be considered by its proponents to be quite contrary to the amendmentthat the beneficiary should have a cash alternative to enable him to buy private coverage.
i think gover rockefellers views represent a very serious difference. because it is quite a different thing for many plans to be negotiating on a local level with many hospitals and many doctors from the federal government paying out federal checks for vendors services. i think that is a very different thing. i doubt very much that my gover would agree with the senators statement that it is  a serious matter. i think he would consider it to be very important. he has always made the point to me that it is very important. gover rockefeller is  for the social security approach as put forward by the proponents of the anderson amendment in the senate he believes it is the best plan. provided it has this alternative which i mentioned.
i thank my colleague. before i had my colloquy with the senator from pennsylvania. i was speaking on the question of what can be made law. it seems to me in respect of what can be made into law. the senate does  have two alternatives. it has only one choice. may i emphasize that again. in respect of what can become law. the senate does  have two alternatives. it has one choice. we k  that aher authority in our country which has a perfect right to pass upon federal legislation has already declared as unequivocally as anyone could declare the unacceptability of a socialsecurity plan of medical care for the aged. it seems to me the vote here will show that such a plan could  be passed over a veto. certainly. our experience in the house of representatives. if we needed any confirmation of that probability with respect to this bill. demonstrates it beyond peradventure. so those who would insist upon presenting the social security plan. anyhow. if it could ever complete all of its legislative steps. which is very doubtful in itself. will invite the president to veto it with full kledge that it simply can become law. as all practical considerations appear to us . i think that is a very heavy responsibility. a responsibility which i believe people ought to think over very carefully before they assume it. and which i think prospective beneficiaries will wish to think over very carefully as they assess the pluses and the minuses which result for the very extended debate on this issue. on the other hand. perhaps one would be justified in saying "if that is the only way to get effective medical care for the aged. we shall try it. we shall force it. we shall do our utmost. anyhow. if the president vetoes. let him veto." that is where i come in. because my amendment demonstrates that it is possible to follow the criteria which the president has laid down as meeting his views. i do  think any senator will argue that the president is  sincere or does  have the same right to his views as we have to ours. the people elected him president. and that fact is one of the factors which must be considered in respect of legislation. it seems to me the proposal i put forward to meet these criteria is the only one that has a chanceand i think an excellent chanceto become law. and to become law by virtue of the presidents signature. the four criteria laid down by the administration in the testimony of secretary -of health. education. and welfare flemming are: first. that the plan should be voluntary. second. that it should be financed in part by the individual. third. that it should be financed on the part of government by a federalstate partnership. and fourth. that the financing by the federal government should come out of the general revenues. those are the four criteria set down by the administration. the criteria set forth in my amendment to be laid side by side with those are. first. that it is voluntary. it is voluntary. as i shall describe in detail in a moment. second. that some payment should be made by the subscriber. which is provided. modest though that payment may be. third. it should result from plans administered on the state level. which it does. and fourth. that the financing for it in the federal establishments should come out of the general revenue. in addition to meeting these criteria. my plan goes one step further. it is the only plan before us in a serious way which gives preventive care to the beneficiary and gives first cost care to the beneficiary. in short. under my plan. the beneficiary can get the benefit of care which is  merely care for catastrophic illness. and. secondand very importantlyhe can get care without paying anything himself when he is ill. even under the anderson proposal. looking at it in practical terms. the subscriber must pay the first $75 of costs. under my plan he pays initial medical care cost whatever. i think this is an extremely important part of this program which is before us in terms of medical care for the aged. and well worthy of consideration. for this reason: the evidence shows that about 90 percent of all people who are over 65 and who have a greater incidence of illness than othersand they do--do  call for catastrophic illness care or chronic illness care. on the whole their problems are problems of temporary illness. although they spend more money than most people do for medical care. they spend more money because they are ill more often or they are ill for a longer time each year than people who are younger. but the overwhelming majority of them do  require catastrophic illness care. these are the figures which bear out that point. and i think they are extremely important in our consideration of this bill. only 10 percent of the 16 million aged citizens. that is. those over 65 who are hospitalized9.8 percent to be exact--actually need to stay 31 days a year or more in the hospital. in short. 90 percent do  require long hospital stays. for those 90 percent the average hospital stay is 14 days. the median hospital stay is 21 days. for the figures upon that subject we are indebted to an official survey entitled "health statistics. hospitalization. patients discharged from shortstay hospitals. united states." published by the u.s. department of health. education. and welfare. i ask unanimous consent that tables numbered 5. 14. and 15 of that factual survey may be made a part of my remarks.
this information shows that for both sexes in the age group of 65 and over the average length of stay in a hospital is 14.7 days. it shows that 9.8 percent of those 65 and over spent more than 31 days in a hospital in any one year. it shows. furthermore. that this 10 percent accounts for about 40 percent of the total number of days spent in a hospital by all over 65. in other words. those over 65 spent 25.809.000 days in hospitals. and the 9.8 percent who stay over 31 days represent 10.005.000 of that figure. or about 40 percent. this is extremely important as a factor for this reason: the anderson program which is presented to us is essentially a catastrophic hospital program. it is essentially pitched to the person who must stay for a very considerable time under hospital care. it provides for 120 days of hospital care or 240 days of nursing home care or 365 days. or a full year. of general health services in the home. if we are going to legislate a program which marks such a tremendous wrench from the traditional way in which our country has handled its medical care problems. we are at least entitled to the comfort of king that this is something essential to the overwhelming majority of our people over 65. but essentially the thrust of this program for longterm hospital care applies to roughly 10 percent of those over 65. i cite as authority for this point the findings of experts who met in a seminar which i conducted with the college of physicians and surgeons in new york. i will key the senate to the report of that very fine seminar. with the names of those who participated. who are probably among the most eminent doctors in the field of geriatrics in the united states. that report showed that what was very desirable for our older people was preventive health care of the kind which is afforded by my amendment. and which is  afforded by the amendment of the senator from new mexico [mr. anderson1. without any invidious comment on that score. except to show the thrust of these particular bills. it seems to me. therefore. that if we are architecturally to design a programand certainly that is what we are trying to do herefor medical care for the aged. the least we should wish to reach in the first instance is the very broadest number of those who really need what we will provide. i respectfully submit that those who need it most in terms of the broadest number to be reached are those who will want preventive care. which is given by my bill. i would strongly urge the senator from new mexico. for whom i have tremendous respect. and who is in the chamber. to look at the report on the seminar which i conducted. and which is found at page 138 of the hearings entitled "social security amendments of 1960." the part of the hearings on page 138 to which i refer is entitled "conference on the role of the federal government in problems of health and medical research. saturday. march 12. 1936. 9:30 a.m."
the senator is exactly correct. i think it is fair to say that if we tried to nail these doctors downand even the other individuals thereas to whether they were for or against the social security approach or were for some other approach. we would be doing an injustice to the purpose of the seminar. the purpose of the seminar really concerned the kind of health care which would be the optimum for older people. that is. after all. what they were most competent to judge. rather than the sociological. political. and governmental implications of how it shall be done. the only point in respect of which i cited the seminar as an authority is the point that preventive care is. in the view of these outstanding experts. the  1 priority. in their view. for a medical care plan for the aged. i tie that to my bill in pointing out that my bill does give the prime emphasis to preventive care. and to firstcost care. that. therefore. being preventive care. i think that is very heavily borne out and substantiated by the seminar. and i have cited the seminar as authority for that proposition rather than the proposition that it shall be done through social security. which is more or less our argument rather than the argument of the doctors. i would  want to bring the doctors into that particular hassle. as to which their competence would  be superior to that of any member of this body. as i am sure they would be the first to agree. i shall finish the argument which i began. and which i should like to reconstruct somewhat. so that we may keep its lineaments. i started by saying that what we who are deeply interested in this subject. are interested in it. considering the division of voting and considering the strong position of the president. a president who. we k. does  k any curlicues in the political game. and has told us what he will do. i think everyone will agree upon one thing he will do. this raises. then. a very serious question that if we want to act . we must act in accordance with reality on some of these principles. i point out that my program follows some of those principles. and i am engaged in demonstrating that. because there is adequate coverage for our older citizens. and that. therefore. a departure from that principle is unnecessary. then i shall go into the factors of the cost of administration. and the arguments pro and con. then to the question of a presidential veto. and point out that cvi1068 even if this chamber should send to the other chamber the social security approach. we must remember that the other chamber has already acted quite contrary to that approach in the bill it adopted. and that before there could be a law. even if we sent our bill to the house. there would simply have to be an agreement with one of the legislative chambers. which has hardly shown itself. so far. to be congenial to the social security formula. hence we have  only the presidential situation. which is serious egh. but also the need for concurrence by the other chamber. which i think is equally serious and at least equally valid.
certainly the senator from kentucky always voices both his own conscience and the conscience of a great many of us. and i. too. deprecate the political situation in connection with this issue. the bill which provides for medical aid to the indigent who can meet their medical bills will. if enacted. go into effect on october 1 of this year. that will be a real step forward. and certainly both parties have progressed a long way on this road. it seems to me that both parties are materially committed to providing material help and an excellent standard of care by the federal government to those over 65 years of age. however. it seems  that this issue will become involved in a political wrangle in the country. i join the senator from kentucky in deprecating that situation. it is most regrettable. indeed. that this issue will be on the political bargain counter. and i am very grateful that the senator from kentucky and many of our colleagues have the feeling that this issue dates back to 1949. when this subject. in terms of health care. was before the congress.
yes. i am sure that in coming to its estimate of figures the department had available the actuarial experience of insurance companies. cooperatives. and group practice units. organizations. such as the health insurance plan of new york. hip. and other plans of that character. a very extensive body of experience is  being built up by the federal government health plan. which incidentally bears far more similarity to the plan that i propose than to a social security plan. it also provides for options. requires participation by the subscriber. and so on. i believe there is very little challenge to be found in the validity of these cost figures. i believe hew has done an excellent job. i am sure they have given the very same estimates to the senator from new mexico and others concerned as they have given to me. i believe this can be taken as an authoritative basis upon which we may proceed. in terms of the overall cost of the plan. if the entire potential of eligible individuals subscribed or. let us say. 11 million. we would have a contribution by individuals of roughly 10 percent of the whole package of cost. so it is easy egh to figure that costs would then be in the area of $1 billion. it appears to me that my plan contains a highly desirable type of participation. by which the subscriber himself would have a feeling that he belonged. i like that idea very much. it has been pointed out. for example. that as the years go on. the individual payer of social security under the social security plan will ultimately come into his own in terms of collecting the benefits in respect of medical care. i respectfully submit that that is  going to be true for a very considerable time. because senators will remember this tax will be levied upon everyone who pays social security taxes. matter how young. and that at least for some time many of those who will be getting the benefits will  have paid social security taxes for it. because if that plan is successful. it will go into effect  or next year or some time near to . i still respectfully submit that when we come to a medical care plan. which is susceptible to so many problems. difficulties. irritations. frustrations. and dissatisfactions. the current participation. the fact that the individual beneficiary will be paying out a few dollarssay $9 or $10 a year in order to obtain coverageis a very strong point in its favor. participation gives the plan a character and body within the content of existing operations in the medical care field. which should i think be gratifying to the individual. and should therefore enhance the quality and character of the way in which this whole operation is administered. i believe that one of the very strong points of my plan is that we would  in a sense lay aside the emous structure of insurance. cooperative plans. group practice units. and pension plans  in existence. for example. some retired teachers were in the other day studying the proposed plan. and with the greatest sympathy. because under my amendment we do  propose to discard every other plan. and to make or plan a big national system. on the contrary. my amendment provides various types of coverage. which make it attractive for people to carry some coverage on their own. we would also open to every state the opportunity to contract with existing insurance plans and existing health plans to give a package of coverage somewhere between the minimum and the maximum. if that action can be accomplished. we give the state the flexibility. to put such a plan into effect itself. my plan is far more accommodating to that approach than is the social security approach. let us remember that 127 million americans. well over 70 percent of the population. are  actually covered by some form of health or medical care in a private sense.
i would point out that the social security tax will fall on those in the lower income brackets without. any participation by the general public who pay taxes. either to the states or to the federal government. i introduced a schedule in the record on saturday. which i k the senator from new mexico will examine. if he has  seen it already. showing that there will  be a very appreciable burden on the states in terms of the plan. the record indicates that in respect of these health matters. for which there is an important public demand. the states always find ways and means of entering into these programs. i have introduced in the record previously. and will again today. the analysis which shows the adherence to federalstate programs in the health field as being very rapid in the first yearall the states come inand the desirability of state participation is so great in terms of citizens of every state that there is a real case to be made for the states joining. perhaps the senator from new mexico was out of the chamber when i mentioned this earlier. there is such a great diversity of medical facilities in the various states that. quite apart from what the senate may do on his measure or mine. i am deeply concerned by the fact that we will be giving an offer of universality to older people about which they may find themselves clearly disillusioned. when we think of the fact that under the senators amendment a longterm stay in the hospital is possible for many people who are newly come to it. out of the eight and a quarter million of the potential which the senator thinks would be covered. and the fact that that is a free benefitand i say this honestly. and one need to be a malingerer. although we have our share of themthere will be an inducement to go to the hospital for almost anything. i am frankly worried about the impact upon our facilities. i question whether most of the people will  be very unhappy with usmyself and the senator from new mexicobecause we can deliver what they think they can have tomorrow aftern at 5 oclock. he is a senator of conscience. and it is a very serious point with respect to our approach to this situation. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point in my remarks a table at page 145 of the hearings entitled "promptness of state response to grant programs." it bears out my statement. made to the distinguished senator from new mexico. that the states move with alacrity with respect to these health programs. i believe it is fair to say that they would move with great alacrity with respect to the program which we are discussing .
i believe so. i point out also that the fundamental direction. as the experts tell us. is for preventive care. at least the option for preventive care is something better than is provided under the anderson amendment. and the comprehensive care package in the case of catastrophic illness is. i believe. superior to it. too.
i do  agree. i think both of us have already agreed that the kerrfrear approach would look after the people who have capability at all in respect to health care. therefore. we are  talking. realistically. about the people who have some capability. i do  see there is any barrier with regard to the effectiveness of the plan involved in the very modest fee.
.  that the vote has been taken on my alternative plan to the anderson amendment and the strictly party line nature of this issue here is clear. i wish to make some observations with respect to my vote on the anderson amendment which is  pending. first. to stress the affirmative. i am convinced that an effective plan giving adequate medical care to our older citizens over 65 is  assured. whether it takes place at this brief session of congress or early in the next session. the backing of both candidates for the presidency and the support which is evident on the republican side for my proposal and which i have little doubt will be evident on the democratic side for the anderson proposal. assure it. namely. that the older citizens of our country will have a very effective. very adequate medical care plan within the very near future. at the very least. what has been attained is general agreement on the proposition that the rank and file of older citizens are entitled to and will receive help from the federal government in obtaining an optimum standard of health care. under these circumstances and being deeply motivated to bring about such a program myself. i have given the most careful consideration to the question of how to vote on the anderson amendment. and i have concluded that at this time. under the intensely political circumstances of this brief sessionwhich i would be blind  to see. and so would the american peoplei must vote against it. my reasons are as follows: first. it is by means the best plan which can be developed. even on a social security basis. and shows clear indications of an effort to make a showing in this perfervid political atmosphere. this is confirmed by three points. an effort is made to trim benefits and therefore to trim costs by setting the eligibility age at 68. but there is evidence that age 68 meets the need which is just as great at 65. in its emphasis upon hospitalization. the anderson plan taxes further the already overburdened hospital facilities in practically every place in the country. aside from creating frustration and dissatisfaction there is even the danger of physical harm in overtaxing the hospitals with older citizens on long waiting lists for the hospital beds uncle sam promised. in its failure to emphasize preventive care. the anderson plan fails to satisfy the absolutely essential need of 85 to 90 percent of the aged in order to meet the needs of the remaining 10 percent. second. the anderson plan is  based upon the varying medical facilities and opportunities available in the different states. but strives for a national program which at the very least in view of the unequal nature of medical facilities in different parts of the country must lead to inherent discrimination. injustice. and frustrating delays. third. it fails to preserve effectively the existing structure of medical care under which over 127 million americans72 percent of the populationare  the beneficiaries. indeed. this is shown most markedly by the failure to give the beneficiary a cash alternative enabling him to acquire his own health protection or pay for his own health services. this would seem to be elementary if the concept of social security were really being carried out
the senator is exactly correct. i thank the senator. fourth. it taxes the population at the lowest end of the earnings scale. reachlrfg thereby only 60 percent of the countrys taxable income instead of spreading the tax load on the whole population for a benefit to the aged population through appropriations from the general revenue. in addition. for some time the people who get the benefits will  have done the paying under the social security system. yet the system as originally designed made at least an effort to do that and  even an effort is being made here. fifth. it makes a profound sociological change in our country. inaugurating a national health scheme in practical effect which is quite inconsistent with our private concept of health care. and yet there is inadequate preparation for it and a program heavily imbalanced in hospital  preventive care. and withstanding the open and practically universal opposition of the doctors. this is to be done in a highly political atmosphere when the time in which the beneficiaries can enjoy the plan probably can be accelerated at all and will have to await a new administration which could very much more thoughtfully recommend the details of a plan of its own. finally. it is for all practical purposes an invitation to votean invitation which will do one any good and everyone great harm because the whole bill will have to be vetoed. hence. social security improvements and the medical plan for the 2.400.000 on oldage assistance and the 500.000 to 1 million who could be benefited by the medically indigent provisions will go down the drain. too. i can see under these circumstances how the path of responsibility can lead to any other than a negative vote. i realize and feel very keenly that many of our older citizens want very much to have the bill passed at this session with a social security approach. i respect and ho them and believe that the whole matter of medical care for the aged has  been brought to such a point where an adequate and truly responsible plan will without question become federal law soon after a new administration takes over. in this connection i restate the principles of such a plan which i have supported and which i will continue to support as the basis for a sound and complete planbut without being doctrinaire even about that. emphasis on preventive care with physicians services and firstcost coverag.&. eligibility for all over 65. voluntary participation. state plans with federal matching so that we can build on existing facilities. federal help out of general revenues. these are the basic principles of the medical care plan for the aged i urge most strongly. whatever may be the strong feelings among many older citizens on this subject. they are neither improvident  unfair. hence. i believe they should see the logic and justice of this position. besides. i do  believe that they would wish to see endangered by a veto which the president would most regretfully have to makeat this stage in the face of an imminent presidential campaignthe early benefit to those among them who are truly in the most urgent need of medical care and who will get material help if at least the committee bill becomes law. i do  think anyone can be doctrinaire about this matter. least of all myself. it may be that we shall find. as i said. a proper meeting ground between the ideas of the senator from new mexico iial candidates on this issue.
. reserving the right to object. though i shall  object. i should like to ask the committee chairman if he remembers that we discussed one of the elements in the house version of the bill which related to the fact that the surgeon general should make grants under the legislation which we hope  will become law only if there was a recommendation by the advisory committee. the word "only" appears in the completed legislation as it is before us. i think the record should show that we also discussed the fact that this does  deprive but. on the contrary. gives the surgeon general the authority to turn down the recommendation of the advisory committee. and to make grant or to reduce the grant or otherwise deal with it unless there is a recommendation. in other words. it is  a mandatory operation on the part of the surgeon general. but he can act in an affirmative way unless there is a recommendation by the advisory committee. i think the record should show that.
. reserving the right to object. and i shall  object to the consideration of the conference report. i hope the senator will give us a little idea as to what happened to the medical research funds. i withdraw my objection to the consideration of the report. but i hope we will  adopt those matters.
does the senator from alabama also feel that we have developed. either in the appropriations committee or in our own committee. egh techniques for checking on results. though they are  necessarily tangible results. we hope and pray for a cancer cure. but we have illusions as to whether or  this appropriation is going to produce it. is the senator satisfied that we have egh people and egh techniques for checking on the utilization of these funds and on the progress which is being made in respect to all of these matters so that when we are in session again next year we will have a body of experts which will help in respect to a new appropriation.
i have great admiration for the senator from oklahoma and his ability. whether we agree or . as we did  on medical care. he really has handled this bill superbly. withstanding the fact that a very dear amendment of mine has gone down the drain. therefore. i wish to commend the senator from oklahoma for the way he has handled the matter.
subsequently said:  i had my say on the pending social security conference report on saturday. with the senator from new mexico . i hope senators will refer to it as a real pledge to do all we can to bring about adequate legislation on medical care for our older citizens next year. i wish to say a word about the mutual security appropriations contained in the supplemental appropriation bill. i say only that it is a fact that it pays to protest. i should also like to compliment and congratulate those senators who like myself are among the most devoted advocates of mutual security yet who voted "nay" on the conference report on the mutual security appropriations bill. it indicates that when we protest and when we have a case. something does happen. i am very glad for the restoration of funds for mutual security and the removal of onerous conditions which have been made. i am only sorry that the minuscule figure of $2 million has  been provided for the private investment incentive program. and i hope very much that it may be repaired in the same fashion.
. who have shown us an example of  only a great public man but also a great family man. to pat and the children. every good wish in life. the happy days are just beginning. all health and success to you.
. i do  think there is any life that is superior to the life of dr. dooley in the flaming desire to convey to people in newly developing areas like laos the aids of medicine and the conviction that western civilization does have a mission for humanity. i ask unanimous consent that editorials from the new york times and new york herald tribune. as well as the obituary ice in the herald tribune. be printed in the record.
. the bill has three titles. title i is revisions of title vi of the public health service act. title 1i is grants for medical. dental. osteopathic. and public health teaching facilities construction. title iii is guarantee of loans for construction of group practice medical or dental facilities. the bill proposes to revise. to consolidate. and to improve the hospital and medical facilities construction grant program. the socalled hillburton act program. it would amend the section of the law which authorizes a 5year program of construction grants for teaching facilities. to expand the opportunities to teach medicine. dentistry. osteopathy. and public health. it would authorize a 5year program of federal credit assistance to construct group practice facilities. this is the new way in which to provide medical service for our people. together. these proposals set forth sound public or institutional planning for facilities. personnel. and organization of services to meet present and future requirements for health and medical services for our people. they are the result of an emous amount of work by the department of health. education. and welfare. and i have the ho to present them to the congress.
. on behalf of myself and senators cooper. of kentucky. scott. of pennsylvania. aiken. of vermont. fong. of hawaii. cotton. of new hampshire. keating. of new york. prouty. of vermont. and saltonstall. of massachusetts. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to provide for a program of federal matching grants to the states to enable the states to provide health insurance for individuals aged 65 or over at subscription charges such individuals can pay.
s plan. is more liberal in coverage. more liberal in benefits. and more accurately reflects what needs to be done in a federal program of medical care for the aged. we will continue to explore every avenue with reference to these elements of a medical care plan for the aging in the effort to arrive at an agreed plan. i ask unanimous consent that a summary of the health insurance for the aged act be printed in the record at this point.
i should like first to support the resolution of the senator from michigan. and i hope very much the senate will approve it. because i think the senator has put his finger on precisely the right point. we need a committee which will deal with all phases of the subject in one coordinated presentation. i express the hope. too. to the senator from michigan that the special committee on aging might make timely reports in such a way as to influence our action on legislative proposals. for example. on medical care for the aging there is a very strong difference between the proposal of the senator from michigan and that of the administration. i do  say that the senator is opposing the administration. of course. he is . but there is a very important supplement in the proposal of the senator that all the aging be covered and  merely those on social security. the senator ks that this is a subject very close to my heart and that of the group of republican senators who are also very interested in enacting a bill. this is one of the main points which has been made by the senator from vermont and a group which. in a sense. he leads. second. there is the problem of age discrimination in employment. which has also been a subject that the senators subcommittee has looked into. and a question of the greatest moment. again dealing with legislative questions which may come up in the senate long before the committee might be inclined or ready to make an overall report. i mention those two examples. at the same time expressing my complete support of the subcommittee and what it is doing. i should like to k from the senator whether. as chairman of the subcommittee. he contemplates that he will be able to give us interim reports on stated subjects. calculated to have some effect because they are timely in connection with the legislative action which is contemplated here.
i think my colleague would be absolutely correct if a foundation had  been laid for this piece of evidence. which came in 1959. by the evidence which admittedly was before the inee in 1958. in the midst of that campaign. senators will find on page 14 an article which was published in the montgomery. ala.. advertiser. and the witness admitted he saw it. he did  deny that. the article is headed: "klan aids pattersongrand dragon called mutual friend." the first few lines of the article read as follows: tuscaloosa. ala.-attorney general john patterson. candidate for gover. is actively supported by the leadership of the ku klux klan in alabama. patterson ks this. patterson. in addition to being supported by the kkk. has made use of the name in his campaign of r. m. (bobby) shelton. grand dragon of the alabama klan. and i call attention to aher article. published in the montgomery advertiser on may 18. 1953. the article was entitled "pattersons manager is amateur." in the article it was set forth that he was specifically asked about this situation. . my colleagues can read the record just as well as i can. i have tried to point up some of its highlights. i should like . if i may. go to one other point on the question of insensitivity which. in my opinion. is absolutely conclusive in this regard. if my colleagues will turn to page 53 of the record of hearings. when the senator from illis had mr. meriwether under examination i. but the senator from illisand will be just good egh to read that colloquy. they can then come to their own conclusion as to whether this witness understood. or at least was willing to admit to us he understood. what he was saying. and therefore was qualified intellectually. in terms of experience and sensitivity. to hold this particular position. i read from the hearings: senator douglas. mr. meriwether. you have said that you have  previously publicly repudiated the doctrines of the ku klux klan. i would  like to ask whether you are  prepared to repudiate them.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record summaries of the bills. a sectionbysection analysis of the hospitalization bill. which i myself am introducing. and an article entitled "dealing with narcotics addiction." written by richard a. kuh. administrative assistant to the district attorney of new york county. setting forth his views concerning a study of the medical treatment of narcotic addicts. let me pay tribute to mr. kuh. who has been invaluable to us in working out the measures we are introducing and sponsoring today. let me also pay a very special tribute to my colleague the senator from new york . who. unbekn to me. had also been working on the medical approach to this matter. and when he heard that i. too. was working in the same direction. he was most generous in agreeing that we work together. in endeavoring to make this historic advance. perhaps the main ornament to our work here in the senate. i am very grateful to him.
. i wish to thank my colleague very much for his cooperation in this whole narcotics effort. i am hoed to join with him in this truly historical and new departure in an effort to deal with the narcotic menace through the medical approach. in the other body of congress. the bills will be sponsored by representatives anfuso. derounian. halpern. and lindsay. all of new york. i join my colleague in the expression of appreciation to all those. whom my colleague has mentioned. who have endorsed the legislation. and attorney general of the united states kennedy. who has taken an interest in it. and whose views seem so promising for action in the future.
. in all the action i have taken on health care insurance for the aged. i have placed substantial emphasis on the fact that an adequate program to meet the needs of our senior citizens should give top priority to preventive medical care. rather than hospitalization. medical experts agree that adequate preventive care would lead to sharp reduction in the occurrence of chronic illness and long stays in the hospital. this can best be done by a first cost program. such as i have included in proposed legislation which i and nine of my colleagues introduced earlier this year. which would make physicians care readily available at home or in the office. this contention is supported by statistics on utilization data in connection with old age assistance health programs. which show that the percentage of eligible persons receiving physicians care was about six times the number who had to be hospitalized. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. with my remarks. an article entitled. "the evaluation of oldage assistance medical care programs." written by dr. s. j. axelrod and published in the journal of public health.
i hope to follow the senator as close as the calendar will permit with my own analysis of the first 100 days of the kennedy administration. and as to where people on my side of the aisle who think as i do should go from there. i congratulate the senator from vermont on his speech on agriculture. we in the big cities have a great problem in protecting our consumers. i like the senators emphasis on the fact that the initiative shall remain with congress. because this. in essence. is the peoples body. i take great heart from the fact that the senator has initiated a process of development of ideas on this side of the aisle by representative members who have a modern outlook. which my colleague from new york will pursue in civil rights. which my colleague from pennsylvania will pursue on information. and which i will pursue in my speech a little later. and perhaps which later we may pursue in the foreign ecoic field and perhaps in the field of medical care for the aged. i hope very much that other senators on this side of the aisle will be similarly encouraged by the fine initiative which has been shown by the senator from vermont today.
i should like. first. to state to my colleague from kentucky that i have rarely heard him more eloquent or more convincing than he was today. i felt gratified and hoed to be able to join with him in what is to us a very important project. and has been to him for many years. i would also like to add a word to the senators view on the specific role that some of us like himself and myself and a few other senators occupy on this side of the aisle. i believe that we exercise commendable independent judgment and we bear great responsibility. especially is that true with respect to measures important in the eyes of our colleagues of the majority and in the eyes of the country and of the world. and i have doubt will be so again. i believe that in doing what senator cooper and i have done. and what i tried to do last year in respect of medical care for the aged. and as i am sure we will have to do in other bills. we have shown that we are hardheaded. that is something which is very essential. this is often very confusing. especially for those who consider themselves liberals. in my view. senator cooper has defined the situation most eloquently. a liberal is a man who is hardheaded. who does  wish to invalidate his own forwardlooking programs by making them cost more than they should. or be less well administered than they should be. or in any way be wasteful. result in advantages for states and municipalities. or for people who do  need them. that is what senator coopzr and i have tried to do today. i hope very much that the senate will consider our efforts in that light. and that our colleagues in the majority will consider them in that light. in our trying to carry out what i deeply feel is our true and most constructive function in this area.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by group health association of america. inc.. of chicago. ill.. urging the enactment of certain pending legislation before the congress.
madam president. while there is a moment of charm and good fellowship. i should like to engage the attention of the senate about a rather important point that arises in connection with my amendment. my proposal was voted on last year. in substance. a few changes have been made. but they are  material. the proposal is a general revenue plan for medical care for the aged. traditionally the social security bill has been the vehicle for plans for medical care for the aged. senators k that we do  have the votes to adopt the plan. any more than we had them the previous time. there have been too many rumors going about with respect to the fact that the administration proposes. withstanding its strong advocacy of medical care for the aged. to place the subject on the shelf until 1962. i and the nine cosponsors of my bill felt that the subject should be brought out on the floor of the senate. and the only way to do so was through an amendment on the appropriate bill. which is a proper vehicle. in order to determine the intentions of the administration. some of us who are cosponsoring the bill. though by means all. have pledged ourselves to try to work out some approach with senators on the other side of the aisle who are similarly minded and have some deference to our views. for example. on the subject of the importance of choice on the part of the beneficiary as between private plans and public plans. which would be provided with respect to preventive care. with respect to state action. and other provisions of the bill. which would give some real attention to the complaints which have been made against it. and which might receive the support essential to its passage. many senators on this side of the aisle who are interested in the same objective that i am believe with me that the subject should  be used for a convenient campaign slogan. that is what ruined the measure the last time. we took such action in 1960. and medical care for the aged resulted.
madam president. it is my deep conviction that this question needs to be acted on at this session. that it must be acted on responsibly is very clear. it is generally understoodthe senator from massachusetts ed it and the senator from new mexico ed itthat we are  ready to act in. a definitive way with respect to this particular measure today. i did  expect that we were. but i did put it forward today because it is my deep conviction that it is the only way in which this proposal can be pressed to issueand pressed to issue it must be. while this amendment is still before the senate and it is being discussed. i should like to make four basic points of principle which. it seems to me. will have to be included in whatever medical care for the aged program is adopted. they are as follows: first. there should be complete coverage for all the aged. even those outside the social security system. this. of course. is   provided in the king bill. the socalled administration bill resulting from the message sent to congress by the president in february of this year. second. there must be an alternative for the individual to manage his voluntary plan or his membership in a medical care plan attributable to his union. his corporation. or whatever the voluntary plan may be. rather than to enter into a government plan. if that should be the way it comes out. third. there should be a preventive care program as an essential part of the medical care plan. and the medical care plan should  be strictly a hospital plan. fourth. and very importantly. there should be an opportunity in each state to improve upon the benefit package while preserving the basic minimum as a uniform plan in every state. this is attributable to the fact that the 50 states have very different opportunities for medical care of their aged person. therefore. they should have an opportunity to improve upon the minimum benefit which the federal government. whether out of general revenues or under some social security plan. or variation thereof. may be able to support. before i take my seat. i shall withdraw my amendment from consideration and shall allow the billbecause i think mine is the last amendmentto pass. for the following reasons: first. i am convinced that there will be aher opportunity before the end of the session. in a measure coming out of the committee on ways and means of the house of representatives. thereby giving this amendment the same status it would have if attached to the social security bill. second. because i have a great feeling that if anything finally results in the way of a plan for medical care for the aged. it will be because of the willingness to cooperate by some of us on this side of the aisle with home on the other side of the aisle. otherwise. as it did before. that will  happen. it is because i do  wish in any way to breach that cooperation or to diminish what i k to be the encouragement which the senator from new mexico derives from that cooperation that i shall  press my amendment today. i believed it was essential. without taking too much of the senators time. to raise the question as i did today. it may be essential before the end of the session to raise it in respect of aher bill and actually to put it to a vote if we do  get the necessary action from the administration and from the majority side. i think is is fair to say that. certainly. the 10 senators on this side of the aisle who are cosponsors of the amendment are deeply convinced that either we must have a definitive plan for medical care for the aged reflecting. to some extent. at least. our views upon which we will have the chance to vote before the end of this session. or we will feel dutybound to bring the amendment i have called up today. or some variation of it. to a vote. we feel that either way the subject must be definitely dealt with before the session ends. also. madam president. i hope very much that what has transpiied here today on the floor will find its echo in the house of representatives and also will find its echo in the hearts of the millions of americans who are very definitely affected. i never received more mail than that i have received in regard to the subject of medical care for the aged. and i believe that other members have received such mail in similar amounts. i am deeply convinced that medical care for the aged remains a burning issue in our country.  only for the elderly. but also for the millions and millions of other americans who. like myself. are maintaining the elderly. after all we pay these bills during our younger years. and unless proper and suitable provision is made. there will be adequate means of enabling them to receive the medical care which society really owes them as a debt. in view of their present situation. therefore. madam president. as i have stated. i shall withdraw the amendment at this time. based upon my sincere belief in the assurances which have been given us by the senator from new mexico and those which have been transmitted from the other body. namely. that before the end of the session. we shall have an opportunity to offer this amendment to a measure which will come from the house ways and means committee. and also because of my feeling that the amendment we have proposed today will have served its purpose if it calls the attention of the president of the united states and the attention of all other americans to the fact that the time to make these amendments is in the year 1961. rather than to wait until just before election in 1962.
i like the use of the word "piracy." it is the word which occurred to me. being a lawyer. i must say the evidence will have to come in as to whether this was a unilateral action by an individual who held up the plane and caused it to land at havana. the question is: what will happen . i join with the senator from new hampshire and with my other colleagues in affirming the fact it is basic to american policy that when a nation finds a plane of that character landing upon its soil it must look after those who occupy it. must see to their needs if they need medical attention. and must return them and return the plane. if it does  do that. or if it damages or injuries the plane. then it will violate international law. must make reparations. and must be answerable for its conduct. i thoroughly agree with the senator from new hampshire that there can be a tyranny of weakness. that is what mr. castro has pulled on us time and time agohe is a "little guy." so "come step on me. come drown me. come extinguish me." this does  save him guiltiness from an international crime. i am glad the senator from new hampshire has spoken. he speaks with authority. as many of us who can should support the position that the rules for castro are the rules of international law. we intend to enforce them. we will  be intimidated by a tyranny of weakness. which castro has imposed successfully time and time again. i join with my colleagues in flagging this action for what it is. this is when it counts as to what castro is doing. because we are big and he is little does  mean that we can allow him to outrage us or to outrage international law.
 herbert hoover.  a resident of my town in new york. many senators will certainly wish to have ed for the record that we congratulate him upon good health and long life. we pay tribute to his services to the nation. and we signalize his birthday with a warm and very happy birthday greeting.
i am so pleased the senator from new jersey has spoken about the fact that sometimes some of us may appear to others of our colleagues to be a little difficult about this situation. and about the procedure. and other such matters. i see feeling of embarrassment by those in this body who feel very much differently from what we do about a strict utilization of the rules and about taking the time of the senate when something is done. or is about to be done. in which they do  believe. i think. on the whole. within the limitations of our own principles. we do our best to be accommodating and gracious and try to work things out in order to facilitate the business of the senate. the senator from new jersey. who has a great reputation in this field. and who is a very distinguished and outstanding lawyer. i am sure ks with me that these matters are inclined to get a little lost and fogged over in the presentation and the punctilios of the ways in which we address each other in this chamber. does  the senator agree with me that we are talking here about two major. critical. basic. aspects of our national security and national life. it is almost impossible to coin a word to define how basic they are. first. what all the colored peoples of the lessdeveloped areas think of us. and our performance in whether we practice what we preach all over the world. at such a tremendous expense and with such a sacrifice. and. second. how can we open our morning papers. every morning . and see the public and private disorder which this problem is creating in terms  only of a very active issue. but of riots in the streets of our country. without reacting to it as strongly as we do.
madam president. i am gratified that the community health services and facilities act of 1961 was passed by the senate today. i was a sponsor of one of the bills which entered into this same effort and dated from my sponsorship of my bill in the previous administration when it was administration policy under president eisenhower. i ask unanimous consent that a statement which i have prepared on the subject be printed in the record at this point.
in my own state of new york there is a potential of 175.000 new york citizens over 65 who might become eligible under the kerrmills bill. but we need a federal program that would reach an estimated 1.325.000 persons over 65 who would fall in the general category of needing some help with their medical problems. this point is emphasized by the fact that there are about 16/2 million people over 65 in the countryincidentally. every day 3.000 more people join the ranks of those over 65and about threequarters of those have chronic ailments. as we all k. people over 65 on the average spend twice as many days in the hospital as the rest of the population. their hospital bills are twice those of persons under 65. and their average income is only half as much.
i thank the senator. the senator from vermont may  have been in the chamber when i started. the purpose of my speech is to point out that withstanding the weeping and wailing which went on in 1960. at the time of the great national campaign. about the fact that we had to do something for the agedat that time medical care insurance for the aged was one of the big measures on the presidents "must" list for 1961the session of 1961 has come and gone without anything being done about the problem. in fact. between the time it was put on the presidents "must" list and last week. when he wrote a letter to the senator from michigan saying he wanted it to have the "highest priority" at the next session of congress.  a word was said about it. it was the big forgotten issue of 1961. i point out that people like myself. the senator from vermont . and other senators have been trying to stimulate some interest in the problem. it is pretty tough when those who made medical care for the aged their big campaign issue studiously neglected it and did hing about it. they felt they had to talk us out of an effort to present an amendment on this subject to aher bill when we did  have the votes to bring the issue directly to the floor of the senate.
i close on the same e upon which i opened. there is  too much use in crying over spilled milk. in the sense that a year has gone by and hing has been done. the thing to do is to improve the present occasion if we can. it is for that reason that i urge the following: first. that the president  only give his support in a letter to the senator from michigan [ himself recognize the fact that the measure can be passed except on a bipartisan basis. as i said. when he was a senator he saw that point evidenced on the floor of the senate. and. therefore. the republicans should be invited to make their contribution to the effort by agreeing upon a bill for medical care for the aged which we can pass at the very opening of the 1962 session
. that when one can offer something for everybody it behooves him to come forward with detailed. factual justification for the panacea held out. and in examining the panacea in this instance. the controlling issue. i submit. is simply this: new york state has a right to. and indeed must. protect its new york milk consumers by establishing the highest practicable sanitation standards. this is new yorks obligation. it is a function for which new york states various health officials are uniquely and particularly qualified. because milk is produced in other parts of the country does  mean that new york should abandon its supervision over milk to be consumed in the new york area unless it can be affirmatively shown that new yorks consumers will benefit in price without any relaxation of sanitary standards. it is  egh for midwestern interest to assert. without more. that wisconsin milk or minnesota milk will be equally sanitary.  is it egh to imply that somehow wisconsin milk on the table of the new york consumers will be cheaper. the burden of proof is on those who would replace high local standards effectively administered with other broader standards. if and when midwestern milk producers can affirmatively demonstrate health and cost benefits to new yorkers then it is time for new york to reevaluate its own position with respect to national milk sanitation standards. there are six reasons why i believe enactment of national milk sanitation standards are  practical or desirable at this time: first. we do  need compulsory national milk sanitation standards. it is generally conceded that the milk supply for the various markets of the country is of high quality and is entirely safe. we feel quite certain that is true in new york state and we believe that it is true in most of the united states. second. local authorities can best determine what regulations are necessary to safeguard their own milk supplies. milk is produced under varying conditions. a regulation which is necessary for one area. may  be necessary or may even be impractical for aher area. for example. it might be desirable to have a regulation in some of the southern areas that milk stables be washed daily. such a regulation in thern new york in the wintertime would seem quite impractical. local authorities can best determine what regulations are necessary to assure a safe supply of milk for their area. whereas a national code would  give the same recognition to local conditions. third. local regulations may be changed quickly to meet changing conditions. new problems in milk sanitation are constantly arising. a local regulation can be quickly changed to meet these changing conditions. the mere mechanics of amending a national code and putting the changes into effect would be very time consuming. it is entirely within the realm of possibility that a strictly local condition might arise that needed a change in regulations. it might  be considered of sufficient importance to change the national code. and the particular locality might suffer as a result. fourth. local authorities have adequate means for enforcing their regulations. local regulatory agencies have the authority to enforce their regulations and can do so quite effectively. in new york state we can effectively enforce our milk sanitation regulations. the national standards which have so far been proposed contain little in the way of enforcement provisions other than those to compel the states and municipalities to accept milk from plants which ship milk in interstate commerce which have been listed as in compliance. while plants which do  comply with the proposed code may be removed from the listed plants. they may continue to ship milk if someone will accept it. fifth. enforcement of milk sanitation regulations can best be done by the regulatory agency in the market where the milk is used. rather than by the federal government or by the state where the milk is produced. a health regulatory agency will naturally tend to be more thorough in the enforcement of regulations to protect the supply of milk for its own people than it would in enforcing regulations to protect the people of some distant market. under proposed national standards a state or a municipality can insist upon requirements higher than those in the proposed code. on milk moving in interstate commerce. if they wish to raise the standards they must first get the code changed. residents of new york state are accustomed to a high quality milk as are residents of many other areas. if our milk supply needs improving we want the right to send our own inspectors out to find out what is wrong and to correct it. sixth. the proposed national standards will tend to lower the quality of milk in some markets. there are a number of instances in which local health regulations are more strict than in a proposed national code. in those respects the local regulations would have to give way to a national code on interstate shipments. in that way local milk supplies could be lowered in quality. while the national regulations do  purport to apply to intrastate shipments. to impose higher requirements on the producers within the state. than is imposed upon the producers of milk shipped into the state. would tend to be discriminatory. as an example. in new york city we have distributors of milk who have their own country plants at which they receive milk from producers. some of these distributors have such plants both in new york state and in other states. it would be difficult to impose more strict sanitary requirements at those plants inside the state than they have to meet at the outofstate plants. i am  saying that national sanitation standards are per se badneither did gover rockefeller. we are saying that the health and welfare of new york consumers is adequately protected . and it is entirely proper that we should examine very carefully proposals to alter our effective and orderly policy. in this connection. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record at this point in my remarks an article by paul corash of the city of new york department of health which appeared in the june 1961 issue of the journal of milk and food techogy. mr. corash has. i believe. apprehended the real issues and set them forth honestly and objectively. i recommend the article to all who have a genuine interest in the welfare of the american milk consumer.
subsequently said:  to designate the month of may of each year as "senior citizens month" provides us with an opportunity to ho the contributions of our older citizens to our ecoic. social. and moral development. it will serve as a springboard for ceremonial programs and activities in each state and community. highlighting needs and programs for our older citizens that still must be met through appropriate legislation. more than 50 million americans are 45 years of age or older. and society can afford to waste the resources of skill. experience. and talent which they represent. this is an expanding sector of our population. and we should be increasingly concerned with problems of job discrimination because of age. substandard housing. vocational retraining. and inadequate medical care. with a genuine bipartisan effort we could have enacted at this session of the congress a healthcare insurance program for the aging. it is indeed regrettable that the administration did  give this program the priority and drive needed to get action. but the thing to do  is  just to give health care for the aging high priority once more. next year. with a "must" tag that could prove as meaningless as it did this year. what we need for this program is administration decision and action during the recess on a bill on which agreement can be had by all who work for it and whose votes are needed in order to pass the bill. this would be a genuine boon to those who are faced with rising medical costs at a time when their incomes and earning capacity are decreasing. we should. also expand our research programs. and should provide opportunities which will enable our senior citizens to lead productive lives. we can make the month of may truly memorable for this important group of americans.
. i refer to a situation which perpetuates in the hillburton hospital construction act the principle of separate but equal facilities. which principle has been stricken down by the supreme court in the school desegregation cases. section 622(f) of the hillburton act expressly provides that separate but equal facilities shall satisfy the mandate of the law. it just seems to me out of the question that we can allow any such provision to continue to exist in our law at this time. in addition. i wish to call attention to the pattern of discrimination and segregation in hospitals and in opportunities of negro physicians which characterize the whole hospital. interns. and special training situation in medicine. hing could be more pernicious than racial discrimination and segregation in the lifeanddeath medical field. yet the existence in our country of racial discrimination in hospitals against negro physicians and negro patients is so clear as to demonstrate the urgent need for some corrective legislation and for government at all levels and medical societies to extend themselves to correct these injustices. as one step in this effort. i am introducing the bill to amend the hillburton hospital construction act of 1946 to bar federal funds to hospitals which maintain segregated facilities. i believe this step is necessary to make clear that the federal government does  endorse racial segregation in hospitals. and i am hopeful for action by congress early in the next session. the hillburton act still permits "separate but equal facilities" for whites and negroesa principle that was struck down as to public schools by the supreme court in 1954. the pattern of discrimination and segregation in hospitals. medical societies and medical schools has been researched for some time  by my office. i would like to outline this problem in these fields as it exists today throughout the united states.
on september 20. senator proxmire spoke again on the matter of national milk sanitation legislation. little purpose is served by continuing at this time a debate and exchange of views on this matter. however important it is to the dairy interests of new york. wisconsin and other great dairy states. there is legislation pending in both bodies to provide for national sanitation standards. and the merits and demerits of this legislation will. of course. be fully considered in committee and thereafter by the entire membership of both bodies. accordingly. in reply to senator proxmire. i wish to say at this time that as a new york senator i do  question the u.s. public health service milk sanitation code. i can say at this time.  can anyone. what the effect of a national law would be on local producers. and i stand . as i always have. for the freest possible interstate commerce. my position with respect to proposed national milk sanitation laws is  negative. rather it is affirmative. based on pride in our new york dairy industry and in our new york sanitation standards. where health and zealous protection of milk consumers is involved. i shall insist on maximum standards and maximum enforcement. we have these maximum standards in new york. and until i can be satisfied that quality and safety will  be jeopardized at all. i shall continue to urge caution and utmost deliberation of this matter by the congress before forsaking new yorks maximum standards which have been of such benefit to the people of my state.
. i shall ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an editorial from the new york times relating to nurses training. which enables me to call attention to an example of constructive philanthropy by william black. chairman of the board of chock full 0 nuts corp.. who. earlier this month. made a $1 million gift to le hill hospital in new york city. to be used to build a 14story nursing school and residence. last year mr. black gave $5 million to columbia university for construction of a medical research building. that was the largest amount ever donated by a living person to columbia in its 207 years. at a time when there is such an urgent need for nurses and for improvements in medical research facilities. such donations deserve high commendation from all of us. i am especially pleased to signalize this gift because i had the ho to speak at the inauguration of the new wing at le hill hospital. which to a large extent is made possible by this gift. i ask unanimous consent that the editorials in the new york times and new york journal american and an associated press dispatch be printed at this point in the record.
. i have previously called attention to discrimination in hospitals throughout the country against negro patients and doctors which has created a problem of increasing gravity. negro doctors meet obstacles to practice and advancement in their profession at every step of the way. some hospitals bar negro patients altogether. some limit the number admitted and segregate them in basement and attic wards. for this reason i have offered an amendment to the hillburton hospital construction act which would bar federal funds from hospitals which discriminate against negro patients. my amendment would eliminate from the hillburton act. the provision for "separate but equal" facilities. in many communities socalled negro hospitals are sometimes the older outworn and rundown hospital buildings that were turned over to negroes after a modern new white hospital had been built. often they are overcrowded. poorly equipped and undermanned. correspondence i have had with father ludger martin. c.p.. of the passionate fathers mission in birmingham. ala.. illustrates the tragic conditions spawned by the "separate but equal" system. under heartrending conditions and almost insuperable obstacles that would long ago have broken the spirit of a less godfearing man. father martin has carried on with his work of healing the sick. i was so touched by this appeal that. although this is remote from my own special interest. i sent a personal financial contribution to father martin. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record with my remarks excerpts from his letters and enclosures. his letter to me of september 27. 1961. his enclosed form letter to philanthropic foundations. an excerpt from a form reply to foundations. his letter to me of october 26. 1961. an excerpt from his letter to me of ember 4. and a news dispatch in the birmingham postherald. ember 2. 1961
. i should like to identify myself with the many congratulations which have been extended today to senator hayden. and the respects which have been so properly paid to one of our very distinguished senators. on the great record he has set in the senate. during the long and fruitful life he has lived. i wish also to express my pleasure at the alertness and the capacity with which he handles his responsibility as chairman of the committee on appropriations. and the great pleasure which all of us have in seeing how the years of his service in this greatest of all deliberative bodies wear so well upon one of our members who has been through so many legislative struggles that senator hayden has. i join my colleagues in bespeaking for him many years of continued good health and valuable service to the nation and to the free world.
. lawrence wien. the federation has undertaken a building fund campaign to raise $104.365.000 under the title "let us build us a city of life." to meet growing demands for services. to modernize obsolete facilities and to house new developments in medical and social services. federation was founded in 1917 and today incorporates 116 agencies covering all aspects of health and welfare services. last year these agencies helped more than threequarters of a million new yorkers on every ecoic and social level and every race and religion. this current great campaign is to be carried on under the campaign chairman. salim l. lewis. with the following associate chairmen: mrs. leonard h. bernheim. irving m. felt. gustave l. levy. and lawrence marx. jr. a special supplement describing the work of the federation and its master plan for a city of life was published by the new york times. october 22. 1961. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record excerpts from that supplement entitled "new roads to reality for the mentally ill". "new dimensions of medical care". "new hope for the handicapped". "a future for the aging". "haven and help for the troubled". "deepened roots for the conmunity". and "the master plan for building a city of life."
i think what the senator from texas is doing is extremely wise and very laudable. he is presenting affirmative alternatives consistent with his philosophy. i may  agree with a great deal of what he presents. and i may  agree with some aspects of that philosophy. but i think it is extremely helpful for my party that it should be given in specific terms. it is especially important  because people like myself who have protested vigorously against what i call the radical rightthat is. people who are away outside of the constitutional concept of american life. who want to impeach earl warren. who call high officials communists. and who want us to get out of the u.n.-should be consistent in their positions and should be given publicity. i myself shall take occasion at an early time to present. as i have on specific measures like trade and medical care for the aged. my concept of what ought to be the line pursued by my party. maybe it is distinguishablei have doubt it will befrom that presented by the senator from texas lmr. tower]. i welcome the fact that we are getting down to specifics. that this is  the radical right we are talking about. this is conservatism. which has every right and as much right as has liberalism to put its position before the country.
 is appeasing southern members of his own party who are in powerful committee positions. by his attitude on civil rights legislation. and as a result many parts of the administrations own program are getting absolutely here. department of urban affairs legislation got here. federal aid to education is  languishing. even aid to higher education. passed by both houses. has  been sent to conference. due to the fact that the bills are being held in the other body. in addition. medical care for the aged is completely bogged. down and eventually may have to be tacked onto aher bill in the senate. these are some of the things that have  been done. in addition. i have in my office evidence of the fact that in the executive department reports are  being sent up to congress. as in my opinion they should be. on such elementary matters as civil rights legislation. i have had a matter pending with the department of justice. on which i wrote to the department on ember 9. concerning a report on part iii of the civil rights act. which is very important. in view of the developments which occurred last fall and which have continued to occur. the attorney general said he was preparing his views. that was on december 14. 1961. i ask unanimous consent that the exchange of correspondence on this subject be included in my remarks at this point.
. finally. i should like to call the attention of my colleagues to a very interesting activity described in a lead article in the saturday evening post. entitled "doctors in the desert." a program which has been conducted under the aegis of the orthopedic letters club overseas project. in which orthopedic surgeons contribute a months service to help crippled and underprivileged persons in jordan. this is technical assistance of high value. i have long urged that if the middle east is ever to have peace. peace especially between israel and the arab states. it will bring with it a new burst of freedom. prosperity. and health. i have always and most ardently favored anything that would tend to benefit the health. the living standards. and the peace and security of the arab people. first. i think this project is evidence of a very helpful activity on the part of patriotic and distinguished americans in the way of technical assistance in a country that urgently needs it. second. it is most significant to me that it is being carried on in arab countries. because it underlines what i have been trying to emphasize so strongly with respect to the essentiality of rehabilitation of the middle east. this could be the greatest antidote for an unhappy and tragic heritage of hate that demagogs are trying to perpetuate in that region. i ask unanimous consent that the article from the saturday evening post to which i have referred be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
. i wish to call attention to a development in new york in connection with the treatment of narcotics addiction. a problem which is affected by one of the provisions of this bill. and which i believe should have very great effect in connection with what we do about this matter. the state of new york has just enacted one of the most modern laws for dealing with this situation. by way of background. i may say that when i was attorney general of new york. i was also chairman of the committee of the attorney general of the united states on the treatment of narcotics addiction. and we brought about the establishment in new york of a citizens commission. under the chairmanship of orin root. of our statewho  is superintendent of banking for the state of new yorkto examine this question. as a result of all that activity. and through the very fine leadership of gover rockefeller and the leadership of his commissioner of mental hygiene. dr. paul hoch. who has served both the harriman administration and the rockefeller administration. there has been enacted in new york a series of measures which authorize hospital care. rather than prison sentences. for narcotics addicts who are  themselves "pushers" or dealers in drugs. when they so request. the state of new york is  working with the city of new york. which has made many additional hospital beds available for that purpose. and together they are  working for greater and improved coordination of the work of all agencies in this field. they are also inaugurating further research work in this field. it is tragic that thus far we have real kledge of the bases for the cure of narcotics addiction. we k that is one of the grave problems which afflicts us in this field. so research is beginning in new york at the manhattan state hospital. this legislation ties in with what we are doing here in the senate. because my colleague and i have introduced bills which seek to bring about the establishment of a federally aided local program for construction of narcotic hospitals. we have federal hospitals  in kentucky and texas. we need one in new york. indeed. the new york state legislature has memorialized congress to that effect. as an aid to its own program. which i have described. it seems to me this proposal will lend support to our efforts on the federal level for necessary assistance to buttress the forwardlooking actions of new york which i have just described. i might say that california has inaugurated a program of the same type. indeed. it preceded ours by some time. and has been a model for us in the state of new york. i ask unanimous consent that the govers memorandum of approval of the narcotic bill in new york. together with a set of editorials from the new york times and excerpts from a news story on the approval of the bill may be printed in the record and made a part of these remarks. next week i shall also offer. together with my colleague from new york . additional legislation in this field. designed to get action perhaps more quickly than would be the case through the bills which have been introduced on this subject. and following the very splendid pattern which has  been set by the state of new york.
. of course. has previously indicated his personal interest in this matter." but said that the agenda for such a conference was still in the planning stage. almost a year later it is still in the planning stage. on august 22. 1961. the secretary of health. education. and welfare stated that his department "will certainly try to complete our preparation of the report before the adjournment of the present session of the congress." at this date the reports have still  been received from his department or any others. meanwhile. two states in which the problem of narcotics addiction is most acute. new york and california. have moved ahead. last fall california enacted a pioneering program in this area. parallel to the proposals which i and my colleagues had introduced in the senate. the california law set up rehabilitation centers in which addicts could receive treatment and to which they would be returned if periodic and surprise tests over a 5year probation period indicated they had returned to narcotics. last week. i brought to the attention of the senate the enactment in new york state of similar forwardlooking legislation. the new york measure offers to addicts medical treatment instead of prison in situations where their "crime" relates to their addiction. at the same time. new york also established a new central narcotics office in the department of mental hygiene to direct expanding state programs in narcotics research. treatment. and aftercare. and created a state council on drug addiction to advise in formulation. progressive improvement. and operation of the states narcotics programs. this last feature. of continuing research. is highly significant and underlines the need for the measure which i am introducing today. while much is kn about the need for a medical approach rather than a purely penal or punitive approach to the prevention and cure of narcotics addiction. much remains to be learned. there has been great disappointment at the high rate of recidivism among prisoners released from the two existing narcotic hospitals in lexington. ky.. and fort worth. tex. consequently there is an urgent need for continuing research into new techniques of prevention and control. particularly in the area of supportive activities in the addicts home environment. the bill  being introduced is designed to fulfill this need by means of federally assisted state and local. public and private research activity. unlike s. 1693 and s. 1694. which provide for a new largescale program for treatment and civil commitment of narcotics addicts. the present bill is designed to provide a research supplement to that program under the alreadyexisting federally aided program in the field of mental health. the bill amends section 303 of the public health service act42 u.s.c. 242awhich provides for up to 100 percent grants to state and local agencies. laboratories. and other public or profit agencies and institutions and to individuals for investigations. experiments. demonstrations. studies. and research projects. the section is presently geared to the development of improved methods of diagis. care. treatment. and rehabilitation of the mentally ill. while it is presently understood that narcotic addiction often is the result of mental illness. there is understandably some uncertainty as to the extent to which research projects in all aspects of narcotic addiction can participate in the existing mental health program. under section 303 grants may be made only upon recommendation of the national advisory mental health council. and applicants for aid must compete for the available funds. to date the emphasis upon projects in the central areas of mental illness research has caused the related narcotics area to be relatively iged both by the council and by those in the field who might have applied for aid. a look at the figures will indicate both the extent of the mental health program and the very mi role which narcotics research has played in it under the present statutory wording. for fiscal 1962. the entire mental health program received appropriations in the amount of $108.876.000. of this sum. approximately $80 million was devoted to grants for research and training under section 303. participating in this sum were 27 grants in some way identified with the narcotics field. grants for these 27 amounted to a total of $793.000. most of this sum was devoted to fundamental research. which is largely laboratory study. only 5 of the 27 projects related to prevention and treatment of narcotics addiction and these amounted to only $160.000 of the total appropriation. thus the 27 projects having some relation to narcotic addiction accounted for less than 1 percent of the total appropriation for section 303 mental health grants. and 5 relating to prevention and treatment of narcotics diseases received only twotenths of 1 percent of the section 303 grants. thus the bill  being introduced. which explicitly includes research into narcotic addiction within the section 303 program. would serve several purposes. it would constitute express congressional recognition for the first time of the relation between narcotic addiction and the general field of mental illness. it would clarify the intent of the congress to include grants for prevention and cure of narcotic addiction within the authority given to the public health service under section 303. by focusing attention on the narcotics problem. it would stimulate applications by public and private agencies which are  entering this field and it would make it possible to increase the share of funds made available by the national advisory mental health council for narcotics research. since it would key into an already going and highly respected program. it is hoped that it will be accepted as a first step toward the broader. new program which is represented by s. 1693 and s. the magnitude of the problem we are faced with and the type of research activity which will be aided and stimulated by the present bill should be indicated. it is estimated that there are 60.000 narcotic addicts in the united states and that over half of these are in the metropolitan new york city area. one wholly private local group in new york city which is typical of the kind of activity which may receive help from a new steppedup program of research grants. is the lower east side information center. this facility. consisting of four rooms on the second floor in a building at 197 henry street on the crowded lower east side of new york city. was organized in ember 1959 in response to the demand of youth workers in the two bridges neighborhood council. a social service agency. and was initially financed by the sea and land presbyterian church. the center charges fees but is financed wholly by contributions from church groups. foundations. one college. and individual contributors. its total budget for 1961 was approximately $5.800. its program is set out in detail in the following memorandum. i ask unanimous consent that the memorandum be included in the record at this point in my remarks.
. i am very grateful to my colleague. this is a fight by both of us. and i hope it will be waged successfully. i should like to make the two points which i believe we wish to leave with the senate: first. here is a new approach to narcotics addictionan approach more promising than that in any other areanamely. the medical approach. it was in effect in california. and it is  in effect in new york. we believe very strongly that it needs to be implemented by such a federal establishment. second. this effort is entirely a bipartisan one. i call attention to the fact that the bill introduced today demonstrates its bipartisanship. and we wish to continue to have this matter treated precisely in that way. finally. i point out that this is an essential extension of our research activities. my colleague from new york has said it fits in completely with the package of bills we have off ered in an effort to bring about the adoption of a medical approach. i was chairman of the committee on narcotics of the national association of attorneys general when i was attorney general. and i can assure the senate of the worthiness of this approach. its validity. and the urgency of its adoption as a national policy. as it has been adopted as state policy in the states of california and new york.
. i am pleased to e the administrations favorable report to the senate judiciary committee on s. 1694. the bill to provide for civil commitment of certain narcotics addicts for medical treatment in lieu of criminal prosecution. this bill. introduced by my colleague. senator keati myself. and a bipartisan group of cosponsors. was part of a series of bills which were designed to complement each other in a forwardlooking approach to combating this grave national problem. but clearly. a system of civil commitment must have both adequate physical facilities for treatment and a constant effort to develop the medical techniques necessary to make such treatment permanently effective. such a bill was also introduced by virtually the same group of sponsorsin this case with me as principal sponsor. it is s. 1693. which provides for narcotics hospital construction needed to receive those addicts who are committed under the provisions of s. 1694. where there is the major density of such addicts. present facilities at lexington. ky.. and fort worth. tex.. are. of course. essential. but can fill the onthespot need if the program of civil commitment under s. 1694 is to work out successfully. s. 3098. introduced subsequently. provides for federal aid to continuing research into methods of control and cure of addiction. i ask unanimous consent that an article in the splendid series of the new york journalamerican on this subject be inserted in the record at this point in my remarks. it underscores the great immediate need for additional hospital facilities. i also ask unanimous consent to have inserted an editorial in the journalamerican which supports this view.
. this will fall upon barren ground. indeed. if there are medical facilities to deal with the problem. it is for that reason that in the companion measure which i have introduced with my colleague from new york . of which i am the principal sponsor. we are proposing a hospital where it is most needed. namely. new york. this is  speaking in derogation of the hospital at lexington. but. as is  true of the facilities in the blue grass country. this situation will be taken care of by civil commitment for those who are narcotic addicts and who are brought into criminal courts without being dealers or pushers of narcotics. i urge the attention of our government in giving consideration to the complete package program. by pointing out this provision is already the law in new york and it is the law in california. these two states are the ones principally impacted with the problem. therefore. we need a narcotic hospital in new york with federal aid. which is the cvir--498 purpose of the bill to which i have referred. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record as a part of my remarks a news story from the new york journalamerican. which refers to the kings county american legion support for the proposal. that group is located in brooklyn. n.y.. which has a population greater than that of most american cities. being several million. the legion urges the building of such a hospital in accordance with the program i have described. i hope very much the fine campaign being conducted by the hearst newspapers and the new york journalamerican in this matter may at long last result in action on the two bills to which i have referred.
. the scope and range of new york states services to its senior citizens were the subjects of an allday conference held on may 1 by the new york state office for the aging. i am proud to point out that new york state. under gov. nelson a. rockefeller. has moved swifty and with understanding to recognize the problems created by the rapidly increasing number of senior men and women and to take action to solve them. action by congress to adopt at this session a program for medical care for the aged continues to be essential. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record some excerpts from the statement by gov. nelson a. rockefeller at the conference in new york. may 1.
 of the broome county medical society. binghamton. n.y.. comments on these matters in that societys journal. i ask unanimous consent to include in the record the statement by dr. judson s. griffin entitled "the commodity of time." which appears in broome county medicine. may 1962.
. on march 28. 1962. i inserted in the record an article published in the march 1962 issue of mccalls magazine. entitled "consumers purchases of beef." written by samuel grafton. concerning consumers purchases of beef. relating to the fat content as affected by the grading practices of the department of agriculture and the resultant consequences to be considered. the health of consumers. at that time i asked the department of agriculture for a report on the questions raised in mr. graftons article. i have received the department of agricultures response and aher letter of comment from mr. grafton. and ask unanimous consent that the letters addressed to me by secretary of agriculture orville freeman and by mr. samuel graf ton be printed in the rzcord at this point in my remarks.
madam president. i have repeatedly maintained that the congress must act at this session on health care for the aging legislation. and that it is up to the administration to decide whether it wants law or an issue. i am looking for a law this year. and i am determined to do my best to help to get one. this will require some votes from the republican side of the aisle and i believe the administration can get republican help if it is ready to reconcile the views of some who have modifications of the kinganderson bill. that bill needs to be improved by providing at a minimum freedom of choice. increased flexibility of benefits. extension of coverage to those  under social security and an option to continue in a cooperative or private health care plan. the view that a "compromise" stand by the president would postpone congressional action is emphasized by the eminent news commentator arthur krock in the new york times of may 22. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record his remarks entitled "part of the record of medicare misinformation."
. i have steadfastly maintained that health care legislation can become law at this session of the congress if the administration will reach an accommodation with those who. like myself. will vote for a program that extends coverage to the 3 million individuals who are  under social security. offers some freedom of choice and increases the flexibility of its benefits and administration. it is clear that the administrations proposal is inadequate and should at the least be revised to conform to the recommendations of medical experts. who emphasize the high priority of preventive care. to the insurance experts. who point to the accelerating growth of private and profit programs. and to the public health experts who stress the efficiency and flexibility of state administration. these are basic principles which i have incorporated in my health care proposal and. as i have demonstrated. they are completely compatible with the social security approach. they make possible a complete health care program.  minimum coverage. based on the right of our senior citizens to proper and satisfactory care. the point that acceptance of a compromise incorporating proposals such as these would strengthen the expectation for a medicare law is made in an editorial in the washington post. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record the editorial entitled "leading from strength" which appeared on june 15. and a letter from the new york times of june 18. entitled "health insurance option." by roswell b. perkins.
madam president. i. too. would like to express the gratification which i feel this aftern at being able to come to the senate with my colleagues on this side of the aisle to join in the amendments with the senator from new mexico and his colleagues in what is close to being a complete approach to the problem of medicare. i should also like to pay tribute to the senator from new mexico for his patience and skill in all the discussions which we have had on this matter. and which have brought us to the brink of agreement. i have joined. together with other colleagues of mine on this side of the aisle. who were named by the senator from new mexico. in the submission of the amendments. i wish to point out that there is one aspect of the amendments on which as yet in our discussions we have  reached agreement. and that relates to the option which shall be given to the individual beneficiaries to participate in a private or cooperative health plan and to receive some assistance with it from the program of the federal government. the amendments of the senator from new mexico on that score contains an option provision which we have been discussing in recent days. and which is  quite what we think it ought to be in the interest.  only of our own views. but also of getting through congress legislation which embodies a workable and satisfactory plan for the american people. therefore. upon that particular point. and that particular point only my amendment deals solely with section 1716. the socalled option provision. i ask that the amendment. which i offer on behalf of myself. the senator from kentucky . the junior senator from new york . and the senator from california . be printed. under the rule.
madam president. i think it most significant that republicans have played what i hope is a major role in redrafting the amendments submitted by the senator from new mexico and in bringing about a merger of the ideas in my medical care bill with those contained originally in the kinganderson bill. it is this kind of bipartisan action which makes prospects for the measure so encouraging. the amendments  submitted by the senator from new mexico. with my colleagues and myself as cosponsors. represent a bispartisan measure. indeed. one is always in trouble when one coins new words. but i am bold egh to try to coin one. i think the bill could probably be called a "medichoice" bill as well as a medicare bill. i believe the revised amendments are consistent with the declarations of the 1960 republican platform and are worthy of the support of senators on both sides of the aisle. the large measure of agreement which has already been reached between a group of republican senators and the senator from new mexico is most gratifying. we have gone a long way toward carrying out the provisions to be incorporated in a medical care bill for which i have long contended. there were four points which. in my mind. always stood out as the differences between those points of view. in our opinion. every one of them has  been fully and satisfactorily covered in the option provision as contained in the amendment submitted by the senator from new mexico. although we feel that further discussion of that question is required. and we have submitted our alternative. there are three points of complete agreement. the coverage is  made well nigh universal for those over 65. including socialsecurity eligibles. i mentioned that the senator from new mexico and his colleagues have devised a plan for them which gets around an income or a means test. which appeals very much to us. it will  be nearly as complete as we had hoped. but we feel that it will serve the purpose. we have considered the proposal very carefully. it does make a leap into taking care of 2.500.000 peoplewe originally thought the number would be 3 million. but 2.500.000 is close eghwho are  covered by kinganderson. it is a very big step forward in the direction of our views. second. state as well as private administration of the government plan has been provided. again. this is a fundamental principle for which we have always contended. and we are very much pleased that it is  recognized. third. a separate health insurance trust fund has been established. thus enabling us to understand clearly the issue of costs as we go along. this provision is extremely important from our point of view. fourth. we have made measurable progress in agreeing upon a provision for an option to permit beneficiaries to retain their private health plans which meet the basic standards. and to bring them within the context of the law. madam president. i shall go further and express the expectation that we shall certainly agree upon that particular issue. having every hope that that will  be the rock upon which we will founder. having maneuvered our way through so many other rocks up to . the changes definitively made so far are those which i and other senators on this side of the aisle have advocated for a long time. we believe such changes would provide great advantages to the people and should go far toward enhancing the prospects of the bill becoming law. as i have said. we shall be working further on the option plan in an effort to come to an agreed position on that point. for a long time. i felt that the social security method of financing was a regressive method because it taxed most heavily those who were the least able to bear the cost. i felt that the general revenue method of financing. according to income tax. was a fairer method. but i have become convinced over the monthsand it has been a very long timethat those who pay social security taxes want to have the program operate in this way. whether it is regressive or . this method suits them better. perhaps from the point of view of personal dignity. they feel they are investing in something which they will realize in due course as they reach the ripe age of older citizens. certainly it is a method of financing which is more ecoical in terms of tax revenues and appropriations. so i finally came to the point of view of embracing this particular method of financing. i say that only for this reason. i hope it will be realized that this has been a difficult wrench for me. my colleagues will speak for themselves. but i k it has been equally difficult for them. but i have come to this point of viewand i k my colleagues feel much as i do. although. as i say. they will speak for themselvesbecause we want very much to have legislation. i feel deeply that the time has come to enact such legislalation. and definitely that can be done unless it is supported in a bipartisan way. so the senator from new mexico has made it possible for us. by listening to our points of view and considering our deeply held positions of policy. to join in what i hope will be a historic effort. an effort which seems more auspicious at this moment. in my view. than ever before.
. as we shall be entering into the debate on the amendments to the pending bill which relate to medical care for our aging citizens probably on or close to thursday. and as members of the senate may be studying the record over the fourth of july. i should like briefly to make some observations on what has been accomplished in the amendments offered by the senator from new mexico and myself and other senators on this side of the aisle as well as on the other side of the aisle in support of the amendments. and also to outline the area of our difference. as it still exists. though i hope very much that there will  be differences when we finally complete our work and are ready in a final way to call up the amendments. the group of senators on this side of the aisle who have worked with me and the senator from new mexico and his colleagues. in an effort to merge our ideas on medical care for the aging. have made substantial gains. which will be of great benefit to the program. one of the most gratifying things that the senator from new mexico said in presenting the amendments last friday was the fact that he felt there had been an affirmative contribution. let us first see what has been agreed upon. and then at what still remains open and subject to an agreement that we can attain. first and very important. a real historical step forward has been taken in coverage. the senator from new mexico estimated that 21/2 million of the uninsured people affected by the proposal  previously included would be included in the bill. these are the people over 65 who are  eligible for social security benefits. very clearly all of those who are 65 on january 16. 1964. when this plan would take effect. will be blanketed in under the law. and would then be included. as the senator from new mexico described it. over a period of time up to 1971. all of these people would be blanketed into the social security system. with the incentive which will be given to get under the system. by the fact that greater benefits will be available. we have doubt that for all practical purposes. estimating in the area of 85 percent to 90 percent. all of those over 65. whether or   eligible for social security. and whether or  eligible for social security as time goes on up to the 1971 datethat a very large proportion will be blanketed in and included in the medical care benefits. so for all substantial purposes. the overwhelming majority of those 65 and over  covered by the kinganderson bill will come in under the benefits of the bill as it is  amended. following the discussions which we had in such an auspicious way with the senator from new mexico . that is the first point.
that is exactly correct. and it is also accurate to add that the anderson amendments benefits are calculated. at the best. to cover onethird of the total medical expenses. or perhaps even as high as 40 percent. but more. so there is an emous range for other benefits to be insured by insurance companies or cooperatives or group units of various kinds. and we hope that as we finally finish our discussions. we shall be able to present themregardless of whether the insurance companies agree with us or do  agree with us. and right  they do  agree with us. any more than does the american medical associationwith an opportunity which they will  forgo.
provided it was either national in scope or represented an appreciable part of health coverage in a particular state. i think the senator will find that the principles which are contained in the option in the bill will be finalized when the senator from new mexico and we agree upon the final character of the option. for example. we may make a change in the percentage of health insurance business which an insurance company must carry in a state in order to qualify. i think the 10percent figure which is  contained in the amendment is too high. but the principle will be established that it can either be as it is  written. a profit organization. fraternal. or otherwise. provided it is either a national company or a substantial company within a state. the 10 percent represents the experience of the senator from new mexico in his own company. that is the way in which the program would operate. as i say. there are three aspects: profit. a national company. or a company of appreciable consequence in the health and insurance field in a state will be able to qualify under the provision. if the senator from new mexico will allow me to proceed. we are at the stage of elucidation. and i appreciate the way in which the senator from oklahoma has opened the question. people are much more interested in what we are trying to do rather than in the merits or demerits of the proposal. which we will have plenty of time to hammer out. in terms of what we are trying to accomplish. i point out that. like the ama. the insurance companies have been very much against the proposaland i do  say this invidiously. because they are honest and sincere in their opposition. in connection with these options we worked in the field of two aspects. first. we have had to study the present practice in order to determine whether the option would lend itself to being adapted within the context of the present practice of blue cross and other organizations. second. we have had to do our utmost to look forward to a time when this provision could be law and when a company. in judging the provisions. would find a sufficient inducement in the option to get into this business. using government benefits. as it were. as a business.
i believe we can give those figures. we have found that there are about 750 insurance companies in the country which write health insurance. the best information we have been able to get from reliable sources is that under the definitions  contained in the amendment. even before a change is made. about onethird of those companies would be eligible under this option. we are advisedand this is all i can tell the senatorthat this provision is an even more liberal provision than that contained in the statute for the insurance of government employees for health. and that this provision allows even more companies to participate than does the regular government employees health plan.
as an intermediary between them and their accountings with the federal government. i am speaking  for the senator from new mexico. and i am sure he will correct me if i am in error. the senator from new mexico has ascertained that in many areas hospitals would prefer to continue their existing relationship with blue cross and let it have the relationship with the government as being more convenient.
on the question of audit. the answer would be "yes." we would build up an audit situation with respect to individual claims. let us remember that if we do  have the blue cross as an intermediary. there is involved either the individual hospital or the beneficiary himself. the question of audit exists in this situation. matter how it is done. therefore. the answer to the senators inquiry about an audit would be "yes." of course. we must immediately say that that does  mean that every claim would be audited. there we get into the administration of claims audited by a government department. matter where we go. whether in the department of the interior or the department of agriculture. or any other branch of government. although they have the right and power and authority to audit. they do  necessarily audit every claim.
i can agree that the patient would  get more benefits. in the first place. he would get more efficient administration. which helps in the sense that things run more smoothly between the hospital and the government. that would be under section 1715. under section 1716. the beneficiary would get the advantage of being able to induce those who are able to offer broader benefits to engage in that line of business.
 necessarily. i merely say that in those cases in which the hospitals would choose the intermediary. the beneficiary would be getting the benefit of the fact that the hospital would provide if there were a more efficient way to deal with the federal government.
i think what is implicit in the senators statement is that the administration as between the hospital and the government is also a factor in the kind of operation the hospital can carry on. and therefore its service to the patient.
the senator from new york does  take any such position in terms of the personal bedside service that a patient might get. the senator does take that position in terms of efficiency of operation between a group of hospitals and the government. if it choose to operate through an intermediary. i thing we have a right to assume that the operation would be smoother for them and. therefore. in those very strange ways which contribute to the satisfaction of a patient. the smoothness of operation between the provider of the service and the government would. in my view. also benefit the patient. that does  mean that there would be an orderly around at all times with a bedpan. but in those interesting ways which. in a hospital organization. communicate themselves to patients when things are going smoothly and efficiently. as compared with when they are . if the hospitals choose to have an intermediary between them and the federal government. the operation will go more smoothly. in my opinion. and will be of benefit to the patient.
that is correct. but i say that for that the federal government will get a benefit in the reduction of its own cost of administration and in the greater efficiency. in my opinion. with which. in that particular casebecause that is the way the hospitals choose to conduct their businessit would operate with the hospital.
yes. i think it is much more deep seated and severe than the opposition i expressed to the social security method of financing. because they do  favor any kind of a medicare bill. and at that time. and to this very day. i am for a medicare bill. and my support of that position is superior to my opposition in the other case. so i have since changed my reason for being opposed to that method of social security financing.
there are a wide range of organizations that can be. for instance. in new york we have two organizations: one is called group health insuranceghi. the other is the health insurance plan. they are very large organizations. for example. one of them covers all employees of the city of new york. i believe that probably an organization of that typeand new york is  unique in that respect. there are others. in other parts of the countrycould come under that plan. in addition. as the senator from new mexico has said. there are many other plans throughout the countryplans of industries and of trade unionswhich have the necessary contractual flexibility to come within the purview of these provisions. once the provisions are available to us.
i compliment the senator on his objective and excellent analysis of the measure which is  before the senate and thank him for his outstanding cooperation in this field. i believe it is just such cooperation that has produced the results which have been achieved so far and which lead to some hope of realizing the long held objective of medical care for our older citizens. i join with the senator from new york in a plea to senators to give their most careful and considered judgment to the proposal which is before the senate. i share with him the feeling that it satisfies essentially and basically the objections which have stood in the way of a broader acceptance of the health care plan. which has been considered ever since august 1960. and brings it to a stage where it is worthy of acceptance by all who have entertained a concern for private enterprise. private participation. freedom of choice. and state participation. so that the adjustment of benefits may become a reality. and  subject to abuse. these are the objectives which have characterized our attitude.
the senator will e that under the bow plan. which is in this respect  analogous. but which gives us a word of warning. it carries within it a lifetime limitation. so that under the plan of representative bow. if a person had a $100 deductible amount. his lifetime limitation which could be incurred under the plan would be $5.000 in cost. if it was a $200 deductible item. it would give that person a lifetime maximum of $10.000. i ask the senator whether it is  very likely that if we left the field strictly to the insurance people. they would write these provisions into other policies and therefore the policies would fall short of one of the very big problems which is involved in this area. which is giving people a sense of mental insurance against catastrophe in all kinds of health problems.
and the mountain will be very hoed. . we are having a conversation  only with each other. but with the country on this subject. i believe it should be very clear to everyone what we are trying to attain and what people like myself. who have come over to a point of view. believe. i believe that we are setting a standard which will be a base for the private enterprise system at a level higher than what in my view it would attain for some time. therefore. the standard we would be setting in the bill. according to the anderson substitute. is desirable. it is a standard which i believe represents a reasonable contribution to the adequate medical care of the individual over 65. we all k that it does  represent all of his medical care. we k. for example. the great power and effectiveness of preventive care in respect to our older people. we k. for exampleand geriatricians tell usthat it is important to keep older people ambulatory. we k that  less than 50 percent or probably nearer 60 percent of their medical expenses will  be met by the pending bill even if it is passed in its present form. etheless. it is a big contribution to medical security. that is what it is. it is a platform on which private enterprise can build higher. it can build even higher on the concrete base that the bill will provide. and bring about adequate medical care for people over 65 in terms of money and in ecoy.
well. i can agree with the senator that this is a government system of medicine. i think a fair description of it is that it is a system of private enterprise and government. it is a mixed system of giving medical careit is  really medical caregiving health care to those over 65. i can agree with the senator. i k he is an able questioner. and i would like to go along with him. but i am intellectually convinced that this is  strictly a government plan.
my understanding is that some kind of health coverage extends to something like 7 millionplus of persons over age 65. again. the senatr is entitled to my source and to every detail. but. again. i am giving the senator my best recollection.
the senator from new york can give the senator from nebraska those facts. except to point out that the rate of increase is slowed as a certain rate of participation is reached. but one of the main factors. which also affects the 7 million. is the extent of the coverage. which is one of the important points which have been made in these debates. which explains. in many cases. perhaps even the majority of the cases. the very limited nature of the coverage. there is health coverage. but it is quite limited in nature.
we have tried to get various estimates on that subject for the 90 days of hospitalization with the $90 deductible. the best figure i can give the senator is this. our research has indicated wide diversities. many companies have much lower ratios of operatings to premiums than do others. we are told that the optimum ratio was somewhere in the 80- to 85percent bracket. that is  even attained. the best figure i can give the senator is that i calculate the cost to the federal government of this type of coverage. on a premium basis. as in the order of magnitude of $100 a year. what a private company would charge for that service remains a question. because the private companies have  been faced with this issue. however. i think it is fair to assume that representative bow rather carefully did his utmost to ascertain what insurance coverage would cost in connection with the proposed bow plan. it is rather significant to me that even with a lifetime limitation of $5.000. on the basis of $100 deductible. and $10.000 on the basis of $200 deductible. on the whole his figures for a $125 premium give. if anything. fewer benefits than the benefits provided by the anderson plan. for example. because. again. we want to have our figures correct. his plan ahe has two alternatives in his proposalprovides 90 days hospitalization. assuming a cost of $12 a day. which i think is a pretty low cost assumption. because apparently insurance companies. generally speaking. prefer an overall figure of $1.080 for all days of confinement in a calendar year. they give $120 for hospital ancillary charges. including surgery and emergency treatment. $6 a day for convalescent hospital room and board charges. and $186 for all such days of confinement in a year. so they are talking about 31 days. and they pay surgical charges--which the anderson plan does according to a fee schedule with a $300 maximum for any single operation. i submit that those benefits are rather materially lower than the anderson benefits. the insurance companies are protected by a lifetime limitation. which i have described. etheless. apparently the optimum figure which representative bow was able to get is $125 a year.
i k. i equated that fact with the nursing home service and the health service provided in the anderson bill. therefore. what will be provided by the federal government. even on this actuarial cost basis. is very much more for the money than what is provided today. i am hoping for much better things.
the senator from new york will. in 1960 i was against the social security method of financing. and i used every argument at my command against it. if the senator from oklahoma will let me have his attention. i would appreciate it. having made his point. i think i would like to make mine. in 1962. coupled with what i consider to be an option method. a radical difference in the whole approach and thrust of this bill. opening it to the cool. clean air of the private enterprise system. i have accepted the social security method of financing for the reasons which i have stated. among those reasons are that the people want to pay for such medical insurance. that there is other way of getting a bill passed. that a medical care bill is desirable. and that there are precautions. which we have gone over time and again. which have overcome a good many of the objections i had to the bill originally. i would be less than honest with myself. and less than honest with the people whom i represent in the state of new york. if. having come to that conclusion. i did  act on it. which i have done. ± am  dismayed by remarks which i made in 1960. of which the senator may find more. which indicated the basis of my conviction upon the previous occasion in reference to the bill which i then sponsored. i would like to point out to the senator that that bill provided for a system of broad medical care for our older citizens substantially as  exists in the pending proposal. the only difference between that bill and the anderson bill was in the method of financing. whether the senator from oklahoma thinks so or . the present anderson bill has been widely hailed as being a real departure. in substantial terms. from the previous kinganderson bill. on which we voted in 1960. in answer to the substantive question which the senator asked me before. i invite his attention to the provision of section 1716. subsection (b). which reads-
page 45. lines 14 through 23: an individual may make an election under subsection (a) with respect to the plan of an eligible carrier only if he was covered by a plan of such carrier (or an affiliate thereof). providing or paying for the costs of inpatient hospital services. skilled nursing facility services. home health services. and outpatient hospital diagtic services which are subject to greater limitations and deductibles than are provided in section 1704. and providing or paying for the costs of some additional health services. continuouslyand so on. i point out particularly the words "some additional health services." in short. whether we have expressed it artistically or to the satisfaction of the senator from oklahomaand if we have  expressed it artistically. the senator from oklahoma is perfectly free to correct itit is our desire and intention to make only those private plans available which have an additional quotient over and above the services provided by the anderson bill.
madam president. the amendment would amend the anderson amendments which are pending before the senate. and is the definitive provision for an option to beneficiaries to continue private health insurance protection. which has been under discussion for a number of days. to replace that part of the bill which relates to the subject. the reason for submitting the amendment at this time is to perfect the anderson amendments. in view of the fact that it is well kn to all senators that the senator from massachusetts [mr. saltonstalli. the senator from connecticut . and perhaps other senators will be proposing complete substitutes for the consideration of the senate. it is therefore important that the senate have before it the definitive provisions of the measure offered by the senator from new mexico when it considers substitutes. it is my belief that the amendment which i am submitting is acceptable to the senator from new mexico . obviously there will be adequate opportunity to debate its merits pro and con as we go along and to debate the amendments of the senator from new mexico. i therefore hope that i may make a brief explanation of my amendment. as i understand. the senator from massachusetts is prepared to present his substitute.
madam president unless other members of the senate desire to be heard in connection with the amendment which i have sent to the desk. at the conclusion of my remarks because i understand the senator from massachusetts desires to proceed. madam president. the health care insurance bill in which i and my republican colleagues have joined with senator anderson is the inclusive and most comprehensive bill on medical care for the aging to come before the congress. it goes far beyond the original kinganderson proposal and incorporates the essential principles which my colleagues and i have been working for and which are consistent with the declarations of the 1960 republican platform. madam president. i should like to emphasize to the senate that "this is it." so far as the anderson proposal is concerned. this is the definitive package which we hope the senate will accept. madam president. what has been achieved. first. all persons who are 65 years of age and older are  entitled to health care benefits under the bill. including those who are  presently covered by social security. this brings into the programs an estimated 3 mil-
yesterday. i submitted a statement. as part of my remarks. headed "summary of consideration given to the problem of health costs of the aged". and i had available at that time a large table and a number of volumes. all of which will be available on monday. so. as the senator from new mexico has said. extensive consideration. in the greatest detail. has been given to this matter. indeed. it probably has been more carefully analyzed and discussed. both in and outside of congress. than has any other domestic issue in recent times. with the possible exception of the trade issue. and inasmuch as it is a matter which is very close to the hearts of so many persons. i believe it fair to say that the people probably have paid more attention to the debates on this issue than they have to the debates on any other issue. ever since this matter began to be discussed. and at least since 1959. when we had the first activity in this field by the then secretary of the department of health. education. and welfare. mr. flemming. the discussion at that time was directly connected with the type of plan we are debating . so i think the senators statement that this matter has received a very great amount of consideration is entirely correct. as a matter of fact. so much consideration has been given to it that probably e of us would be able to take the time which would be required to analyze all the hearings on it. including those on the special problems of the aged. to which the senator from new mexico has referred.
first. i wish to express my pleasure at the association which i and other senators have had with the senator from new mexico. but. more important. two words used by the senator from new mexico are critically important. tomorrowassuming that i then have an opportunity to speaki shall endeavor to develop some points in regard to what i understand was a very forceful and typically able speech made by the senator from oklahoma . but i should like to comment  on two words the senator from new mexico used. one is the word "conservative". the other is the word "developed." i think those two words are rather key words in connection with my own feelings and. i believe. also the feelings of other senators who recently have come to favor this way of meeting the problem of medical care for the aged. it is true that when a program is begun. obviously it must be financed in the beginning. just as a railroad train must get underway slowly. i believe that would be accomplished under this bill with a minimum of effort. under the circumstances. especially in view of the urgency of the need and the necessity of making a beginning. what has impressed me particularly is that this method provides for payasyougo financing. especially since those who have this need give every evidence of willingness to pay for the assistance. from a conservative point of view. since this plan would take care of about fourfifths of the estimated cost for the first yearthat is. the social security payments themselvesit is a more conservative approach than the general revenue plan which i and other senators proposed. especially since i am convinced that those who would paythose at the lower income scaleare willing and anxious to do so. for reasons which we have discussed many times. the senator from new mexico also made the point about the development which has occurred. this has been an extraordinary development. i understand- that the senator from oklahoma .13647 spoke of it very feelingly. as i have said. i hope tomorrow to make some remarks on that subject. this measure has been developed in a very effective way. and i wish to emphasize that point in the record to be read by senators who tomorrow will participate in the forthcoming allimportant vote. this measure has been developed. and . instead of providing a ceiling. as the kinganderson approach did. this measure provides a plan which is a floor. so that private enterprises and cooperative enterprises in the united states which wish to do so can participate. this is the traditional american way. and this development has been extremely and critically important. again i wish to express the gratification which i feel for the openness of mind on the part of the senator from new mexico in connection with the efforts he has made to bring the measure to this pass. and also for the development in connection with the coverage. we fought for universal coverage. and i am happy to say that we were successful. but we did  contemplate the plan which  is included in the bill. which gradually will implement those who are to be covered into the social security system. i consider this to be a really brilliant concept. aiding the legislation a great deal and doing it a great deal of good. and putting it on a solid and orderly basis. from which it will prosper. i wish to add these few words in regard to the distinguished senator from new mexico. who has fought so manfully for this matter from its very beginning. the measure  is conservative as regards its financing. second. it has developed from being a ceiling into being a floor. which is very much germane to the american way and to the capabilities which inhere for its development and its improvement. i congratulate the senator from new mexico on his usually thorough and extremely able statement. and i express my pleasure at being associated with him in this effort. i hope all senators realize the seriousness of the vote which will be taken tomorrow. let senators understand that the vote tomorrow will be the payoff vote. this program will be dead. in my opinionwhether for this session. or perhaps even beyond thatunless tomorrow the motion to lay on the table is rejected. all of us realize that that will be the payoff vote as regards medical care for our older citizens. so i hope all senators will read very closely the arguments which have been made on both sides.
. i shall have an opportunity to address myself to the debate in due course when the appropriate point is reached. however. there are two points in which senators may be interested in respect to the debate upon which we shall enter in a definitive way in a short time. the two points which have been made to induce senators to vote for the suddendeath motion to table are. first. that there have been adequate hearings on the question of health care for the aged and. second. that this is a most unusual procedure in which the senate is being asked to attach a very major measure to aher major measure by way of amendment. on the first point. which is the subject of hearings. i should like to refer specifically to the fact that the hearings which have been held on the question of medical care for the aged. and concerning the precise methods of financing and techniques which will be discussed in the debate. and have been discussed for some days . are the following principal hearings: first. hearings on h.r. 4700. the forand bill. july 13 to 17. 1959. before the house committee on ways and means. second. hearings before the committee on finance of the senate on the social security amendments of 1960. h.r. 12580. june 29 and 30. 1960. third. hearings on h.r. 4222. health service for the aged under the social security system. before the committee on ways and means of the other body. july 24 to august 4. 1961. there was a series of hearings. and there were individual state reports. to the special committee on the aging. headed by the distinguished senator from michigan . which took place in 1960 and 1961. and up to finally. there was a report of the performance of the states in 18 months of experience with the kerrmills program on june 15. 1962. all those hearings are available. obviously. senators can read all of them. but certainly the physical evidence itself is formidable. and is before the senate. on the other subject. concerning our right to attach a major measure to aher major measure. and the considered precedents. let me point out that such action has been taken on many occasions in connection with some very significant and important questions. for example. in 1937 we attached the tydings resale price maintenance act. which amended the antitrust laws. as a senate rider on a house bill. a very important measure of federal law. in 1925 we put a senate rider creating the initial federal corrupt practices act on a house bill. we did the very same thing with a number of civil rights amendments. including the continuance of the u.s. civil rights commission. we did the same thing in 1958 with a postal pay increase bill. which was placed as a senate rider on a house bill. we did the same thing in 1933 with the buy america act. which was placed as a senate rider on the treasury department appropriation bill. we did the same thing in 1912 to repeal a reciprocity act with canada. but what is even more pertinent is the fact that only a few days ago. during the controversy over proposed sugar legislation. senator protested or argued that it was improper to select a bill related to honey bees and amend it with a very important provision of the whole sugar legislation program. i therefore submit. on the basis of longstanding precedents which are considered. that we have previously attached major legislation to house bills when we thought it was desirable to do so. and we shall do likewise in the future. the present situation certainly commends it. and the only senators who will complain will be those who are against the measure. so i  make the point. which i hope to make again before the debate is concluded. that one has any idea that the country will look at the vote as other than a vote on the merits. the vote will be sudden death or it will be life for the measure which promises some health care for our aging citizens. vote can be disguised in this regard upon procedural or technical grounds. whether it be with relation to hearings or with relation to attaching a major measure as an amendment to a house bill.
. unless we provide a program. let us  forget that. let us  forget that there are people who do  go to the hospitals because it is too expensive. and they get sick and die sooner than they should. let us. remember that the younger people. children and relatives of the aged. are supporting them. they are interested in this proposal. let us remember that the younger people are paying the. social security taxes. and they look forward to this program.
let us also remember that the younger people will pay the social. security taxes. and they look forward to doing so with dignity and capacity. on the basis- of selfassurance. which is the highest form of selfreliance and of individual private enterprise. especially since we have  protected the amendments by opening them up to the. whole competitive private enterprise system. this is an opportunity we may never have again. i hope very much that the senate will decisively defeat the motion to table the amendments. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in. the record at this point as a part of my remarks an article entitled "nursing home evaiuation and the question of hospital affiliationw written by john a. hackley and published in hospital topics for
. i have also in mind calling attention to what my colleague from new york referred to as the seveninsurancecompany pool plan for health care in new york state. it is well kn that i joined with the senator from new mexico in the bill which was before the senate for health care for the aging. and i have every expectation that it will be acted on in the next congress. but the new york plan. under the guidance. and i think the inspired leadership. of gover rockefeller. demonstrates how critically important is the private sector in the matter of health care for the aging. a matter which i have insisted on. and finally won incorporation of in the socalled anderson bill. and which has proved to be entirely valid. there are alternatives from the private sector which intelligent leadership on the part of state governments. insurance companies. cooperatives. and health care plans generally can bring to the public attention and make active for the public good. that is also true of the bill of representative curtis in the other body. which opens up to pension and welfare plans greater opportunities for health care. i think it is irrefutably true that the premiums which must be charged are
. the complexities of the problem of health care for the aging and the issues it has created are reflected in the lack of information that still exists in spite of the wide exposure and lengthy discussion given to the medicare problem. a statement by a group of 53 physicians associated with the university of rochester medical center shows that there is support for the andersonjavits health care proposal among practicing physicians in spite of the american medical association opposition. and a recent gallup poll indicates that a great deal more public education is necessary if the american people are to have the information they need to make correct decisions. i ask unanimous consent to print in the recoad the statement of the 53 physicians associated with the university of rochester which appeared in the democrat chronicle. rochester. n.y.. july 29 and the report on the gallup poll on medicare published in the washington post. august 22.
. i modify my amendment by striking out the word "shall" in line 3 on page 1 of the amendment and inserting the words "may. within the discretion of the secretary". and on page 2. line 5. by striking out the word "shall" and making the same insertion. the amendment proposes that. insofar as the secretary may exercise his discretion. subject to such exceptions as the secretary may by regulation prescribe. ice must be given to those to whom experimental drugs are to be administered. this is a very much mooted point that has been very hotly argued in the committee. and in various circles in which the subject has been considered extending to this point in our discussions on the floor of the senate. the point is critical. it is said that there is need to make any provision on that score.  even a discretionary provision. because the decision can be left safely to the ethics of the medical profession on a statebystate basis and that the profession will take care of the situation. i have had the library of congress look into the question. i report to the senate as follows from the survey: in our search of the laws of the 50 states we found state statute which covered the use of an experimental drug and required the physician to inform the patient of such use. the survey submitted by the library of congress contains an anation of state laws on the question of new drugs. which supports that fundamental finding of fact. i ask unanimous consent that the statement of the library of congress. together with its conclusion and detailed analysis of the laws of the respective states. be printed at this point in my remarks.
. what has alarmed the country and. in my opinion. brought the bill to the point of passage as a billand i hope very much that the bill does passis the great concern which was sparked by the use of the drug thalidomide. let us remember that thalidomide was  adminstered to mental patientsat least  in mainto people who would suffer terribly in terms of being upset if they knew they were taking a medicine which was experimental in character. or to people who had some fatal disease. the ladies to whom the drug was administered were pregnant. the ones we were worried about were those who had a fatal disease that a doctor did  desire to inform them about. the drug was administered to people who could have been told. and then if they chose to take it. they would have taken it. if they did  choose to take it. they did  have to take it. i am for experimentation. i feel deeply that some risks must be assumed in experimentation. but we must hold the balance between personal dignity and personal responsibility and the right of the individual to k how his life is being disposed of. at least with his consent. and the virtues of experimentation. we have found that there are always egh people. whatever may be the danger of the drug--often. for example. inmates of the jailswho are willing to lend themselves to experiments. therefore. experimentation should  be conducted in a blind way. without people giving their consent. i understand the problems in cases in which there is some fatal terminal disease. and in which the doctor. in the exercise of the judgment which the hippocratic oath assures will be used conscientiously. decides he will  tell. the secretary could exempt any new drugs from any such regulation. there is the case of the hypertense patient. or the situation in which the drug may have some other effect if a person ks he is taking it for a specific reason. in which the secretary may decide that the testing reason is greater than the possible risk which might be run. my amendment applies only to the question of safety. in short. only if the drug has  yet been reasonably demonstrated to be safe would my amendment apply at all. finally. the amendment in completely discretionary. it is saidi think in perfectly good faithand was the cause of a great deal of discussion in the judiciary committee itself. that if we should write such a provision into the bill. the bill might fail and go down the drain. it is said that doctors would  want it. and it might encounter such opposition that the bill would  become law. i think that begs the question. if it is right. sound. just. decent. and proper. and we can tell a mature adult who is going to be used for experimentation with a drug which has  yet been reasonably demonstrated to be safe and who is well able to come to the decision that he wants it himself and is  going to be adversely affected either in his illness or as a possible testing ground for the particular drug. where is the dignity. the responsibility. and the freedom of the individual. in short. some balance must be maintained. i do  think we can summarily sweep the whole problem under the rug and let the situation continue as it has existed up to this time. i should like to point out one other point which i think is very important. the amendment of the senator from colorado contained a provision which. i believe. called for a written statement on the part of the testing expert. in the discussions on the bill it was said to relate to experts. that is. to those who are qualified by the fact that they are watching the drug experimentally. to advise the secretary as to its merits or demerits. they are called experts. but when we debated the subject in the committee on government operations. of which i am a member. and heard the whole debate before the subcommittee presided over by the senator from minnesota . the upshot of the debate and the testimony before us was that almost any doctor could qualify as an expert. all he has to do is to sign a paper saying that he is an expert. it is claimed that under the bill as it is  written the secretary would be a great deal tougher about deciding who is and who is  an expert and that he might or might  accept the statements of certain individuals who merely sign a paper and say they are experts. we k hing about that whatever. past experience on the question is very clear. any physician who signs a document stating that he is an expert is thereby deemed to be an expert. and that will be the end of that dispute. it seems to me that under those circumstances we would certainly need something by way of an expression on the part of congress that where it is feasible and practicable. the course suggested should be followed. that is all the amendment provides. where it is possible. feasible. and practicable. it should be done. and under other circumstances. there is real need and a real problem. it is  a problem that can be solved by forgetting about it. we should manifest a sense of responsibility by dealing with it. i would  make the provision mandatory. i would make it completely discretionary. i am allowing for as many exceptions as the secretary wishes to impose. indeed. my amendment is hing but a license to complain. if that is an apt phrase to describe what i have in mind. in short. there would be opportunity to complain where there was ground for complaint in the administration of the law. we should  forego the opportunity to write into the bill the right to complain where we feel injustices are being done or risks are being taken. it is for these reasons. king full well that this matter has been discussed and considered and talked about. and. i believe. rejected by.the judiciary committee. for which i have great regard. and i understand the complexities involved. that i believe the senate. in the final analysis. must weigh in the balance these two questions of personal consent and personal dignity and the overriding interestwhich i agree is overridingin experimentation. i believe both can be reconciled in the -way in which this amendment has been drafted. with all of the "outs" which the amendment provides. i see the senator from colorado on the floor. i hope that it will be very clear that whatever is done in this matter is done by both of us.
it relates to something that may look as inent as an aspirin tablet. but may be extremely harmful. the food and drug administration this aftern has issued a release about this in connection with thalidomide. it is my opinion that the amendment which i propose might be adopted by the senate. however. i have desire and the senator from colorado has desire in any way to destroy the bill by putting up some new structure different from the structure which is contemplated by the bill. however. we do want the patient to be consideredat least considered. . we want at least to raise a red flag. to say that the patient should be considered. at least to give a license to every senator to complain if he thinks the patients interests are  being protected to the extent that it is medically feasible to do so. therefore the senator from colorado and i. after laboring on this matter for many hours. have developed a modification of the amendment. to insert in the committee substitute. on page 12. line 20. after the word "profession." the words "and the interests of patients." as i said. we have worked under great stress. we would provide that at least * the operative aspects of the regulations which the secretary would issue must give due regard. as this law would then say.  only to the professional ethics of the medical profession. but also to the interests of the patients. beyond that we trust in the secretary and in our own lung power. if we feel there is a grievance. at least there will be something in the bill which shows our intent with respect to our solicitude for the patients. without in any way destroying the structure of the bill.
. the problem of health care for the aging will continue to come before the congress until a practical solution is provided. with the percentage of the aging in our population continuing to grow and costs for medical care continuing to rise while their retirement and other incomes remain relatively static. it is obvious that assistance must be forthcoming if these millions of americans are to get the health care they need. many questions were raised in the senate debate on the andersonjavits bill last july. and i have therefore invited a health care task force composed of some of the best minds in our country on this problem to go into the question of the best way to provide health care for our senior citizens. this task force will. it is expected. bring in a report and recommendations seasonably so that we may have the benefit of their thinking early in the next congress. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record the text of my anncement made in new york. september 12. the statement by former secretary of health. education. and welfare. arthur s. flemming. and the news stories which appeared in the new york times and the new york herald tribune. september 13.
first. i pay my respects to the chairman of the subcommittee. the senator from tennesssee . and i express my admiration of him and the pleasure i have had. particularly in working on this amendment. which the senator from colorado has described. as i understand the conference report. it requires that the secretary of health. education. and welfare shall include in his regulations a provision to the effect that experimental drugs may be used only after the patients consent is obtained. i point out. in that connection. the importance of the use of the word "shall" at that point in this measure. the use of the word "shall" definitely imposes this responsibility on the medical profession. with the result that the doctor will have. in addition to his responsibility under his hippocratic oath and under the ca of ethics. the clear responsibility of finding. if he decides  to obtain the consent of the patient. that to obtain his consent would  be "feasible" or in the professional judgment of the investigator would be "contrary to the best interests" of the patient. i believe that provision supports very definitely the contention we have made. i should like to have the senator from tennesse. who has been in charge of the bill. confirm my understanding of this part of the report.
i was seeking to establish the point that it will be the professional responsibility of the doctor in both casesboth as to the determination of feasibility and as to the determination of the effect on the patient. the inclusion of that provision imposes a greater sanction than merely the use of the word "feasible." as professional men. the senator from tennessee and the senator from colorado and i understand that one will  assume that responsibility except on the basis of the greatest exercise of conscience. that is what the conferees have provided for. i also congratulate the senator from tennessee . with whom i worked on aher aspect of this bill. a provision with respect to stopping the experimental use of drugs on humans in the event they are deemed to be unsafe. i am pleased to e that that provision also is in the bill as reported by the conferees. so. madam president. i congratulate the principal proponents and sponsors on our side. the senator from illis and the senator from nebraska . and also the principal proponents and sponsors on the othe-" side of the aisle. the senator from tennessee . and also the senator from colorado . for the provisions they have proposed. which  have been included in the conference report.
 will send us a message on that subject. it is a fact that there are differences between the administrations plan this year and our plan. which was voted upon in 1962. i do  exclude any expectation of any kind or character of our getting together on a workable conclusion to the administrations views arnd to our own views in order to get a healthcarefortheaging bill enacted into law. it will be remembered that our bill as well as the administrations approach is based upon social security financing. we are introducing this bill today as evidence of our good faith that we are in favor of the basic principles of the bill we supported in 1962. in offering this bill. we say. in a joint statement. that we are renewing our commitment to work for the enactment of a health care insurance for the aging bill under social security. with proper safeguards. we are further renewing our determination that any such bill should contain the following four principal provisions. for which we have always contended: first. to include the estimated 21/2 million americans over 65 who are  covered by the social security system. second. to provide for an option under which beneficiaries have a choice of receiving hospital benefit programs through approved private plans rather than through the federal government. third. to provide for the use of approved private organizations and states in the administration of the program. fourth. to provide for the establishment of a separate health insurance trust fund into which all health care funds shall be deposited. e of us are closing our minds to other provisions. under the social security scheme. of financing or reaching the objectives which i have stated. such as those incorporated in last years andersonjavits bill. or of achieving workable. efficient healthcarefortheaging law. we will examine carefully all developments in this field and will be ready to cooperate with the senator from new mexico . as we did last year. in working for the passage of a law which will meet the pressing health needs of our aging citizens. the provisions in our bill are essential if there is to be recognition that private enterprise is an important partner in the effort to meet the special needs of the aging and can help to limit federal government expansion in this field. if we are truly to prevent socialized medicine. the entire burden and responsibility for meeting the health needs of the aging should  fall entirely on he federal government. the establishment of a federal health insurance trust fund as the depository for all tax funds collected for this program helps to promote fiscal responsibility in meeting the costs of this program and also serves as a check on expenditures. in this respect. too. participation of approved private organizations. such as the blue cross. and of the states themselves in the administration of the program. will increase ecoy and efficiency since it would make use of established and experienced administrative machinery. the inclusion of all persons over 65 in this program. whether or  they are entitled to social security benefits. is a provision which i and my cosponsors have insisted upon from the very beginning. this is accomplished by a phasingin process which has been worked out satisfactorily by the social security administration. this is a temporary problem. because by 1965 practically all americans will be covered under the social security system. there is increasing recognition of the fact that most persons 65 years of age and over lack adequate protection against the high cost of illness. there are 17 million americans in this age group. and because of modern spectacular medical advances. their number is increasing each year and they are living longer. older people need more medical care and make more use of health care facilities than other groups in the population. and they are faced with rising medical costs at a time when their earning powers have declined or ceased altogether. it has been estimated that in the last decade. the consumer price index went up by 12 percent. medical costs. however. rose by 36 percent while hospital costs soared higher by 65 percent. group insurance premiums went even higher. in some states going up by 83 percent. since 80 percent of the aging have incomes of less than $2.000 per person53 percent have incomes of less than $1.000 a yearthey must therefore have assistance to pay for essential health care. experience has demonstrated clearly that the existent kerrmills program. with its state welfare basis. needs test. and insistence upon filial responsibility. is inadequate as well as excessively uneven in the allocation of benefits. about 90 percent of its expenditures are made in 3 statesnew york. massachusetts. and michiganleaving only 10 percent for the remaining 23 states in the program. thus kerrmills will  help the millions of aging who need health care and can be expected to get it themselves. the bill we are introducing today is essentially a hospitalcentered program and it is intended to provide protection against the high costs of hospital care. census statistics show that when persons 65 and over go into hospitals they stay more than twice as long on the average as young people. they need more diagtic services. more drugs and more appliances. this bill provides 90 days of inpatient care in a hospital with a minimum deductible of $20 and a maximum deductible of $90. up to 180 days in a skilled nursing home if it follows treatment in a hospital. outpatient diagtic care with a $20 deductible. and 240 days a year to provide health care in the individuals home. it does  provide for care by doctors unless they are part of the hospital staff. and therefore does  run the danger of interfering in the traditional doctorpatient relationship. in addition. the bill gives an individual who is covered by an approved private insurance or service plan the opportunity to continue that protection after he has reached age 65. he also has a choice of hospital benefit programs between the statutory benefit of 90 hospital days after a $90 deductible or 45 hospital days without a deductible. an approved private health plan. to qualify at the beneficiarys option under this legislation. would have to be a group plan. a profit plan or a plan which returns in benefits at least 85 percent of the premiums. the added premium would be for additional benefits beyond those provided for in the rederal government program. thus a private health care plan giving the beneficiary much more than the government benefits would actually cost much less than a person would otherwise have to pay for such increased protection. because the carrier would  be permitted to charge a premium for that part of the health care benefit which is reimbursable by the federal government. this presents the private insurance in.ustry with an unprecedented opportunity to write an extremely generous program. a premium of only $3.30 a month could pay for outofhospital diagtic services. surgery. and medical care in hospital. when added to the other benefits under this bill. and this is by means the last word which can be provided at low costs. although this bill is in most respects the same as the one before the senate last year. it differs in one major feature. we have liberalized the home health care provision by making it available on the prescription of a physician. this can become the answer to many of the questions that have plagued proponents of this legislationquestions about how to keep costs down and to avoid hospital overcrowding and long waiting lists. over 200 agencies in 40 states are  providing a variety of home health and homemaker services. and in some instances these are actually hospitalbased programs. costs for homecare services have been estimated at $6 to $9 per dayapproximately onefourth the cost of a hospital dayand with professional supervision it is becoming an increasingly important way of treating chronic disease and long term disability. it can be used satisfactorily  only when the patient is recuperating from a long lness. but also at times when hospital beds are  available and the patient can be temporarily taken care of in his home. if homecare services are available in a community. experience has shown that hospital use by aging citizens can be materially reduced. the patients themselves are relieved at the thought that they do  have to leave familiar surroundings. and cost for services can be brought down sharply. the need for federal action in this field continues to grow more pressing. and i am convinced that the thought and discussion and conclusions based on hard experience. which have been incorporated in the drafting of this bill. have made it the best and most considered legislation to meet the great health needs of our aging i wish to say that i have rarely seen such a demonstration of accommodation and friendship as i saw among the four senators who are sponsoring the bill with me today. when the question came up for determination: shall we again reiterate our position in support of our basic principle. the general consensus was. what does senator anderson think about it. if senator anderson felt any objection or felt that the proposal would interfere with progress and hope for progress in this field. i doubt very much that i or any of my colleagues would have cosponsored the bill. but we have every feeling from our discussions with the senator from new mexico that we are making a first step of commitment. as we did before. and that. as it proved to be last year. it will be the basis upon which we may jointly work out the problems which we will have. in view of the fact that the administration has . as we had perhaps hoped it would. actually supported again the same bill which we voted on last year.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. two bills which. along with those introduced by my colleague and other senators. constitute our package of proposals to deal at the federal level with the grave national problem of drug addiction. as attorney general of the state of new york. the seriousness of the problem. especially in the new york city area. where there is the greatest concentration of narcotics addicts. and the need for a concerted attack upon it were strongly impressed upon me. since that time. the needs have become even more urgent. early in the 87th congress. as the result of studies and recommendations made by leading lawenforcement and publichealth officials. my colleague. the senator from new york and i and other senators introduced two of the bills being reintroduced today. the narcotic addict hospital facilities act. s. 1693 in the 87th congress. would establish a new federalstate program for the construction and operation of narcotic hospital facilities and for the provision of technical assistance to the states. up to 75 percent of construction costs would be provided. to be distributed among the states in proportion to each states share of the addicts in the nation. operating grants made available under the bill would cover 60 percent of operating costs ot such hospitals or similar state facilities meeting the requirements of the act. in order to be eligible for assistance. the states would be required to establish an adequate aftercare program. to be financed wholly by the state. this bill is  being reintroduced by me. with senators keating. case. hart. and kuchel as cosponsors. the civil commitment bill. s. 1694 in the 87th congress. being reintroduced by my colleague. the senator from new york and myself. along with other senators. is a companion measure to permit the civil commitment of narcotic addicts to the custody of the surgeon general so long as the addicts are  charged with an offense involving the sale or other transfer of narcotics and so long as other provisions are met. later in the 87th congress we introduced s. 3098. to provide a research supplement to the largescale program for treatment and civil commitment of narcotics addicts represented by the first two measures. this measure makes it clear that the already existing federally aided research program in the field of mental health is applicable to research in narcotics addiction. under this program. grants up to 100 percent may be made to state and local agencies. laboratories. and other such public or profit agencies and institutions and to individuals for investigations. experiments. demonstrations. studies. and research projects. this bill is  being reintroduced by me with senators keat-
in conclusion. i firmly believe that the medical treatment of narcotics addiction is one of the major reforms we can make in our country. although i do  believe we can adopt the british scheme of administering narcotics to addicts. we may try that as an experiment in order to see whether it will work. in my view the medical commitment approach. along with hospitalization. aftercare. and expanded research. as dealt with by this group of bills. are the only way in which we can come abreast of this critical problem. which has its main impact in an absolutely alarming and sensational increase in the crime rates of new york. where such addicts are concentrated. los angeles. and other cities of the united states.
first. before saying anything else. i should like to say that i have worked with many senators and many members of the house. but never with greater harmony. friendship. warmth. and understanding than i have with the very distinguished senator from new mexico in the matter of medicare for the aged. i am  happy about the fact that the administration has put in its bill. i am pleased to k that the senator is handling the matter again. i am  happy about the fact that we could  join in the administrations proposal. and had to put in our own bill. i see closed minds in this matter. i believe the difference on the option question is resolvable. i will certainly. as i did before. lend myself to any means to resolve it. because i think this measure is going to need every vote it can get. i deeply believe the margin may again be small. this time on our side. and therefore it is important to arrive at the agreedon bill in the interest of the measure itself. i should like to say to the senator from new mexico that. having  established our position. there is a medical task force which is working on this subject. it has already received a modest amount of financing. and with that establishment i had something to do. its composition would satisfy anyone. being composed of doctors. hospital administrators. and former secretaries of health. education. and welfare. i will do my utmost to accelerate the report to be submitted by this group. that report was expected to be submitted on april 1. under the circumstances it might come sooner. i am hopeful that perhaps in this way we will find a way in which we can arrive at a meeting of minds on this subject. i took the greatest of satisfaction in our agreement last year. and in the generosity with which the senator from new mexico allowed the bill to be designated by both our names. i have every hope that we can find areas of agreement on what seems to be the one outstanding problem. namely. the private sector option. as i have said before. and as the senator from new mexico has said also. i again pledge the senate my own best efforts to accomplish that result.
. if my colleague from connecticut will indulge me. i ask unanimous consent that i may proceed for an additional 5 minutes to discuss aher subject. which is quite different from and has relation to the message on health care for the aging.
. i ask unanimous consent that i may introduce out of order. for appropriate reference. for myself and senators beall. case. fong. keating. kuchel. and scott. bills relating to public accommodations: a bill to prohibit discrimination on account of race. color. religion. or national origin in the furnishing of accommodations and facilities to any person at hotels or motels. the business of which affects interstate commerce. and a bill to amend the hospital survey and construction act to prohibit discrimination in any respect whatsoever on account of race. creed. or color in hospital facilities. and i also ask unanimous consent that these bills may be printed in the record.
. pan american airways. new york city. winslow carlton. health consultant. new york city. and dr. howard bost. of the university of kentucky. executive director of the committee. i do  think egh attention has been given to the organization of this body. and in the sense that people may look forward to and may expect this reportwhich of course will be available to all the publici call attention to the fact that this group is in being. and i also call attention to those who are members of it and to the problems with which it will deal. i hope that when the national committee on health care for the aging makes its report. it will immediately be made available to all members of congress. and that it may be a real guide as to whether the bill which i and a number of other republican senators have introduced or the andersonjavits bill of last session or the administrations bill or some other plan is the best. but i am confident that the report will be a very important milestone in this field. and i think the members of the group are very representative professional and lay persons who have undertaken this very large task. it will take about a year to complete. they have held an emous number of meetings. and certainly they are entitled to be kn. and certainly they are entitled to the respect of all of us for the job they have undertaken. so we eagerly await the result of their work. aher group at work on this subject is the health information foundation. which became affiliated with the university of chicago in 1962. it has recently released an analysis of the national health situation and the needs which will have to be met in order to provide for the changing medical picture of our population. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an analysis by the health information foundation and a report of its own future plans. entitled "current problems in hospital and medical administration." which was released on march 11.
. when the persons who have done the most for u.s.-israel friendship are finally listed in the annals of history. one of those who will be most highly named will be theodore r. mckeldin. former mayor of baltimore. former gover of maryland. and consistent champion of miity groups. gover mckeldin was an organizer of the americaisrael society. in israel. a forest and a hospital wing bear the name "mckeldin" in tribute to his activities. he holds an hoary doctor of laws degree from the jewish theological seminary of america. in new york. and he is also a fellow of the hebrew university. in jerusalem. and a fellow of brandeis university. in massachusetts. where a $50.000 teaching fellowship is named in his ho. to all who are interested in human rights. the name of theodore mckeldin is syymous with our fight against prejudice and bigotry. and the sincerity and perseverance he has exhibited while working in behalf of the brotherhood of man have been acclaimed by his fellow men everywhere. with such a background. it was especially appropriate for theodore r. mckeldin to speak recently before the confirmation class of the baltimore hebrew congregation. this baltimore congregation was chartered in 1830. i ask unanimous consent that mr. mckeldins remarks before this confirmation class be printed in the record.
. the problem of health care for the aging will continue to grow more urgent and more complex unless congress takes action on a practical solution. with the percentage of the aging in our population steadily increasing each year. and costs for hospital and other health care rising rapidly while the retirement incomes of the aging remain relatively static. it is obvious that prompt action to provide assistance in meeting these high costs is essential. millions of americans are  going to be able to afford the health care they need without the kind of health care insurance proposed in my bill. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record an article entitled "chances brighten for passing medicare measurein 1964" which appeared in the rochester (n.y.) democrat and chronicle. sunday. march 10. 1963.
i wish to associate myself with the distinguished senator from kentucky in memorializing. as he has. the life of the president of yale university. dr. griswold was one of our most gifted educators. i knew him personally. he made significant contributions toward american public and educational life. i join the distinguished senator from kentucky and all other senators in an expression of sadness on hearing that he has been cut off at the most fruitful point in his life by the dread disease of cancer. if we needed anything to stir us to herculean efforts to deal with the terrible scourge of cancer. we see in dr. griswolds passing an impressive example of what the disease has cost our world.
. that is practically an americans creed. which each of us has almost the duty to urge upon those who have any mind for public responsibility at all. it is beautifully said. with the typical simplicity and warmth of judy weis. judy weis was active  only in political life but also in the life of her community. the rochester area. where she worked in its hospitals. serving on the womens board of the genesee hospital and the board of the rochester convalescent hospital for children. judy. weis was active in the rochester business and professional womens club and in almost every other fine community effort that could be imagined. mrs. weis was also a woman of exceptional taste. she conducted a personal poll to help select a national flower. she reported that the rose wonthe rose being also the new york state flowerby a heavy majority. i believe that the most fitting tribute one could pay to judy weis is that she was herself a rose in her charming sweetness. her delicacy. and the beauty of her character. she is enfolded in her graciousness to become a part of the beauty of all time. on behalf of my wife and myself. i bespeak our deep sympathy for the f amily of mrs. weis in their hour of bereavement.
i believe i can state a fact on that subject. the medical care task force to which the senator has referred is expected to submit its report by the middle of june or  later than the end of june. i think the senator will find in that report a really effective way to accomplish what he wishes.
first. i apologize to the senator from kansas for rising a short time ago. i had intention of preempting the floor. i did  realize that he was seeking the floor. second. i share with the senator his approval of the measure. which i believe introduces for the first time in the national establishment the concept of enlightened treatment as well as the home care and community center care treatment of people who are mentally retarded or are mental cases. the senator has spoken from his experience in kansas. we in new york have made extraordinary progress through the excellent work of dr. paul hoch. our commissioner of mental hygiene. which has resulted in a complete revolution in the administration of our mental hospitals. in a complete revision downward of the needs and in the escalated use of mental hospitals. such as. for example. in the field of narcotic addiction. i am most pleased that the bill as reported reflects the enlightened view that narcotics addiction is a medical. as well as penal problem and may be dealt with as part of a mental health program. dr. hoch has conferred with the consultants of the committee. and he is satisfied that the proposed legislation recognizes new concepts in the subject of mental illness in a most admirable way. and that it will help states which are advanced in their programs. such as is the case in the state of new york. this is only a part of the program. there are problems of research and there are problems of hospital construction. also. there are still many patients who must be confined. withstanding the admirable thrust of the proposed legislation. however. this is an excellent program. i join with the senator in expressing my gratification for it. as i shall be differing with the chairman. senator hill. in one apsect of this bill. i should like to say at this time. rather than later. that in his leadership in the health field. of which this is aher example of so many milestones and sources of tremendous gratification for those who serve with him. he gives understanding and added support and inspired leadership. i join with many of my colleagues in the senate who have lauded him today for his leadership in bringing the bill to its present status on the floor. i pay my tribute to him and give recognition to the bill as reflecting a concept of the subject of mental illness that will be helpful. in the light of the pioneering experience in my own state. of our legislature. gover rockefeller. and dr. hoch. with this concept.
. we have still to meet the challenge presented by the problem of providing for the health care of older people. hospital costs are continuing to rise and an increasing percentage of our population consisting of americans 65 years of age and older are being confronted by the problem of paying for the health care they need at a time when their earning power has drastically declined and their incomes are at a low static level. the need for a federal program paid for on a contributory basis to defray at least the largest part of the cost of the health care will become more acute as more and more americans live longer. thanks to modern medical advances. while health care costs continue to go up. the bill which i have introduced sets forth certain basic principles of cooperation between the federal government and the private sector in dealing with this problem. this is the way in which i believe we can solve this problem in a reasonable and satisfactory manner. this approach to the problem of health care insurance for the aging is discussed in some detail by marion b. folsom. secretary of health. education. and welfare in the eisenhower administration and currently director of the eastman kodak co. of rochester. n.y. mr. folsom is also a member of the national committee on the health care of the aged which i was instrumental in organizing. has been making a careful study of the entire problem. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the article written by mr. folsom. entitled "how to pay the hospital." which is appearing in the atlantic monthly. july issue.
first. i should like to compliment the senator from oregon on his statements on the constitutional morality of our nation. and especially on his statements made from the great vantage point of his position on the foreign relations committee and his understanding of the international implications of this civil rights struggle to our nation and to the rest of the world. i have offered civil rights amendments to various bills. including the mental health bill. it is my sincere conviction that there is a necessary place for such amendments when we deal with programs such as the mental health program. when we k that unless we do something about civil rights in that connection. the programs will be administered in a discriminatory way. i also think there is a place for such amendments when we deal by indirection with the financing of. for example. airports. when the part financed by the federal government would  be segregated. but the part built around it would be segregated. so i believe there is a proper place for such amendments. however. i have too much respect for the senator from oregon. and i value too highly his alliance in this fight. to be critical in that regard. i am delighted that the senator from oregon is carrying out his basic principles and his fundamental beliefs by introducing generic legislation. i never had any doubt as to his attitude on this question. his proposal embodies it in practical legislative terms. i hope that the senator will join with mei k he will. i only say that rhetoricallyin expressing the belief that the authority resides in the president to withhold federal funds. collected from citizens without regard to race. from state programs which are racially segregated or discriminatory. the federal funds could be withheld by the various departments. they should be withheld. the introduction of generic legislation of the character proposed. expressing. as it does. the deep conviction of the senator from oregon. certainly will  diminish his own fight one whit. a number of us are fighting the battle to see that that authority is exercised  in appropriate cases. as my colleague ks. even in the mississippi case. which the u.s. civil rights commission so hotly assailed. the commission said that the president should consider that possibility on a selective basis. who could disagree with that statement. it was seized upon as being an acrosstheboard desire to force the state of mississippi. but that was the view taken by the commissions enemies and  its friends. i k the senators feelings on that. i k the senator will  diminish for a minute his efforts with a number of usthe senator from michigan . and myself particularly to do our utmost to see that. until such time as a generic statute is passed. the president etheless exercises the authority that we are deeply convinced he has  to withhold funds. presidents have done so previously. for example. in respect to airplanes and in respect to a highway scandal in indiana. where there was a charge of corruption. surely when the constitution is being violated by a state. the president has the right to. and should. withhold funds.
i thank my colleague. exhirbt 1 s. 1665 a bill to require that all state or local programs supported with federal funds shall be administered and executed without regard to the race or color of the participants and beneficiaries be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that it is the policy of the united states that. in all programs administered or executed by or for the benefit of the states or their political subdivisions and supported. in whole or in part. with funds provided by the united states. individuals participating in or benefiting from such programs shall be segregated or otherwise discriminated against because of race or color. slc. 2. moneys shall be paid by the united states to or for the benefit of any state or political subdivision thereof under any program of federal assistance(1) to plan or provide facilities. services. benefits. or employment in such state or political subdivision. (2) to defray administrative expenses of a program in such state or political subdivision. or (3) to defray the cost of carrying out a program in such state or political subdivision. if the participants in or beneficiaries of such program in such state of political subdivision are segregated. or otherwise discriminated against. because of race or color. sec. 3. the programs of federal assistance referred to in this act include. but are  limited to. programs7(1) to assist the construction of hospitals. schools. highways. airports. parks and recreational areas. community facilities. and public works generally: (2) to provide oldage assistance. medical assistance for the aged. assistance to needy families with children. assistance for maternal and child welfare. assistance to the blind. assistance to the disabled. and public health and welfare assistance programs generally. (3) to provide financial assistance to the unemployed and assistance in the training. retraining. and placement of workers. (4) to provide assistance to business. including agriculture. (5) to provide assistance to educational institutions and to individuals for educational purposes. and (6) to provide assistance to national guard and civil defense activities.
. the need for doctors. nurses. therapists and other trained professional health care personnel is growing at a rate that is increasingly urgent. the growth of population is far outstripping the ability of our schools to attract and produce the required numbers. moreover. costs of a medical education have risen far beyond the ability of all but a relatively small number of students to meet. this shortage of health service personnel could well result in a decline of medical quality and needless hardship and suffering. federal assistance in meeting these needs is essential. including the legislation  pending before the congress. and a longrange program seems essential. a provocative and stimulating paper on how to create tomorrows health services on the basis of recognized needs and resources has been written by marion b. folsom. former secretary of health. education. and welfare. in his capacity as chairman of the national commission on community health services. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record mr. folsoms article entitled "todays health needs and tomorrows services." which appeared in the journal of public health. june 1963.
. the services performed by private philanthropic foundations in numerous areas of our nation and their importance in our national development deserve careful study. this year the rockefeller foundation is celebrating its 50th anniversary and the record of its activities even in summary is a tribute to our free society. guided by the founders statement on may 14. 1913. that the best philanthropy involves a "search for a cause. an attempt to cure evils at their source." the foundation has appropriated funds over the 50year period for projects which held the potential of improving the state of mankind. its encouragement spurred initiatives in public health. medical research. social sciences. humanities and the arts. agriculture. and educational development. the achievements of the foundation. which has its offices in new york city. have been beneficial to man in all corners of the earth. in 1962. grants were received by institutions in 60 countries for research and development projects. the record of the rockefeller foundation is unparalleled in the history of philanthropic giving and its achievements deserve wide recognition. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the statement by the trustees of the rockefeller foundation on the occasion of the foundations 50th anniversary in may 1963. summarizing its activities.
 of the university of oregon. is also chairman of the national committee on health care of the aged. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the remarks of dr. flemming which appeared in senior citizens news. october 1963.
 juan bosch and took over in the dominican republic. but despite the grave political developments which followed in that country. i am gratified to report to the senate today that the polio immunization campaign is proceeding as planned. indeed. in a letter which i have received from teodoro moscoso. u.s. coordinator b for the alliance for progress. he informs me that  only is the polio immunization campaign proceeding. but that it has apparently "broken the back" of the epidemic. i ask unanimous consent that excerpts from mr. moscosos heartening report to me be printed at this point in the record. the arrival of the polio vaccine donated by the lederle laboratories of american cyanamid accompanied by 1 million cups from the lilytulip co.-all freely transported by pan american airwaysreceived wide publicity in the country. the rising incidence of paralytic polio had begun to cause great fears. especially in the capital city. and there is doubt that the people reached by the news of the vaccines arrival were deeply moved by this unusual contribution. we are assured that in spite of recent political events. the immunization campaign is proceeding. we will continue to be in contact with the pan american health organization. which has been overseeing the program since the departure of the public health service experts. a recent article in el caribe * * * annces the beginning of the second round of immunizations and explains the importance of returning for a second dose. aher article shows that administration of the type ii vaccine is underway. the first dosage. administered was the type i vaccine. which is considered to have effectively broken the back of the epidemic. we do  expect any change in or neglect of this important program in the dominican republic. should anything of that kind occur. we will be informed. and in view of your considerable and special interest. we would transmit such information to you.
 of the university of kentucky as its study director. the committee issued its report this morning. this report is the rock upon which a successful measure for health care for the aging can be built. many of the aspects of the committees report follow the provisions which the senator from new mexico and i had the ho to establish in our bill. but the departures are significant and of the greatest moment. and lend themselves to implementing legislation of a character and quality which i think will make the difference between success and failure. this morning the task force reported that there is need for a basic federal law based upon social security financing which would give fundamental hospital and nursing home care to those over 65. that will include all persons over 65. whether or  they are social security beneficiaries. however. once that is done. once that basis is laid. the report recommends a tremendous program of insurance for the risks of health care above the basic minimum hospital and nursing home care. it is estimated that hospital care cost is about onethird of the total of the annual medical bill. that onethird is attributable to physicians. surgery and similar emergency care. and that the other onethird if made up of numerous other. but generally less urgent. types of medical care. this proposal deals with twothirds of the medical care needed. onethird being hospital and nursing home care and the other onethird being emergency health and surgical services. the first third to be on a government plan based on social security financing. the second third to be covered by private insurance. but on a profit. taxexempt pooled basis. very much like the .plan  being so successfully carried out in connecticut and new york. which is kn as the 65 extended health insurance program. there is desire or design on the part of the task force to invalidate the kerrmills law. they are perfectly content to have kerrmills. it has a place. but that place is in a welfare program for welfare clients. it is  insurance and it does  in any way perform the service which needs to be rendered for the rank and file of older people who are covered by the terms of this report. i hope members of the senate will read the committees report with the greatest care. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a press release which covers the particular report. the report itself is quite extensive. consisting of 79 typewritten pages. copies may be obtained upon application to me or to winslow carlton. of new york. who has functioned as a member as well as secretary of the task force.
the thanks of the nation should properly be given to the chairman and members of the national committee on health care for the aged. which was formed at my suggestion in september 1962. for their dedicated and most important work in developing and making public this report. this report is the most significant development in the field of health care for the aged since july 1962. when the senate turned down the andersonjavits bill by the vote to which i previously referred. the report should serve to put this issue once again in the forefront of national consideration. where it rightfully belongs. from my preliminary review of this report. it seems to me to establish an excellent basis. in fact. for implementing legislation for health care for the aged. i shall study it further and invite our colleagues to join with me in the introduction of new legislation. and i shall also invite the prompt attention of the executive department and the appropriate congressional committees to this report. it is my urgent hope that i may be able to join the senator from new mexico . our colleagues on his side of the aisle. and colleagues on my side of the aisle. in sponsoring immediately the legislation which i am  engaged in drafting. this report brings a federal program of health care for the aged measurably closer to realization. this issue. which seems to have been shoved off the boards. has been brought back to the front and center of the stage by the report. for the information of senators. i shall read into the record the names of the distinguished gentlemen who gave of their time and attention to bring to the country a meaningful analysis of such a program: arthur s. flemming. chairman. university of oregon president. former secretary of health. education. and welfare. russell a. nelson. medical doctor. vice chairman. director of johns hopkins hospital. winslow carlton. secretary. chairman of the board of group health insurance. inc.. of new york. the members of the committee are: james p. dixon. medical doctor. president of antioch college. marion b. folsom. former hew secretary. and presently a director of the eastmankodak corp. russell v. lee. medical doctor. director of the worldfamed palo alto clinic. john c. leslie. chairman of the committee on aging. community service society. dr. ver w. lippard. dean of the yale medical school. dr. dickinson w. richards. el laureate in medicine from columbia universitys college of physicians and surgeons. thomas m. tierney. director of colorado hospital serviceblue cross. hubert w. yount. former senior vice president of the liberty mutual insurance cos. arthur larson. director of the world rule of law center. duke university. and former under secretary of labor. i extend the gratitude of many millions of americans to these extraordinarily able and distinguished americans who. i trust. will have measurably forwarded this historic proposal of providing adequate medical care for our aging citizens.
. the aflcio convention in new york has passed an extraordinarily fine resolution with respect to the report on medical care presented by the national committee on health care of the aged. this distinguished committee was organized at my suggestion last year on a bipartistan. political basis with members representing business. insurance companies. the medical profession. and hospitals. its recommendations have aroused widespread interest and the statement that was adopted unanimously by the fifth biennial convention of the aflcio on ember 20 commending the work of the national committee and urging that its report be given careful consideration by the house ways and means committee is most significant and welcome. i ask unanimous consent that it may be printed in the record.
 kennedy was to issue a statement hbiling this report and its importanee in tais field. the bill goes far beyond any existing proposal developed to meet the urgent needs of our older citizens. \it comes closest to meeting the specifications laid down by health care experts and at the same time deserves to and should attract support on a bipartisan basis. my colleagues and i deeply believe that this is the bill for medical care for the aging which has the best chance of being accepted by congress at this session.
 kennedy. of beloved memory. received the report of the national committee on health care for the agedand the bill translates into legislative terms the committees recommendationshe expressed the hope that implementing legislation would have broad bipartisan support. i believe that the bill comes close to meeting the requirements of the health care experts as well as of legislators on both sides of the aisle. it will do so at a cost which is relatively modest in view of the magnitude of the program. i am confident that the cost of the public part of it will be just about what is called for under the kinganderson proposal. it will avoid the dangers of socalled socialized medicine. it will observe the traditional doctorpatient relationship. and provide for the participation of the private sector. which has built up a great and deserved interest in the field over the years. i offer the considered judgmentand i believe my view is shared by my brothers in this effortthat the program is one which has the best prospect of becoming law in 1964. i ask unanimous consent that a sectionbysection analysis of the bill. as prepared by the library of congress. be printed at this point in my remarks.
i am very grateful to my friend the deputy miity leader. i assure him that without his help and that of other senators. such as the senator from new york and the senator from maine . the proposal would  have reaehed its present stage. i hope and feel that this time we shall be successful in providing health care for the aged.
i would like to pose a question to the senator. the senator ks me well egh to appreciate that i am  trying to move him into a corner. i k his views very well. but what deeply troubles me as a lawyer. and i believe what troubles many of us on this side of the question. is that in the case of the small cafe owner. the small druggist. and the small merchant generallyi believe the senator well ks of my origin. i have  lost touch with them. i assure the senatorbusiness has the protection of the law in everything that it does. the mere facts that the door is open. that one can break the window in. that the kitchen.is kept sanitary. are due to the protection of the law. what deeply troubles us is that where protection of the law is afforded. all the protections of law must be afforded. we can have the store owner say. "i am sorry. i am going to accept so much of what the law allows. but i am  going to give the rest." for exampleand again i do  wish to be considered extreme. but i merely ask the senator to think about it. i do  even ask him the question because. as i have said. i am  in any way interested in strategizing with the senatorif we consider the case of a small owner of a pharmacy. the senator and i k that if a pharmacist wanted to pander to the narcotics addict or to the doctor who is performing abortions or some other illegal practice. he could make a great deal of money. but because of the law. he does  do so. even if his failure to do so might mean that he would be put out of business. that is parallel to what troubles us here. withstanding local customand local custom was something which at the very latest had to go out with the 14th amendmentwe equate the whole body of law as being totally enforcible upon all americans and in favor of all americans. that is the real moral and legal question which to our minds represents the real issue. i thank the senator.

accounts presumably the permission to resume and the external auditors report for 1963 are the baking of matzoth is supposed to be  before the assembly. it is therefore  possible to provide the committee with the audited figures on budget performance. however. we can give you provisional information on the 1963 financial situation. we are glad to be able to report that the financial position of the organization continues to be sound. the collection of contributions as at december 31. 1963. was 87.32 percent of the total assessments on active members. the corresponding percentages for 1961 and 1962 were 93.90 and 94.20 percent. respectively. however. payments received since january 1 of this year enable me at this time to report a very satisfactory position regarding the 1963 collection of contributions. details will be reported to the committee when it deals with agenda item  3.12.1status of collection of annual contributions and of advances to the working capital fund. briefly. payments amounting to $3.303.034. relating to arrears for 1963 and prior years. were received during the period january 1 to february 29. 1964. so that as at this latter date 97.29 percent of the assessments on active members relating to 1963 had been collected. on february 29. 1964. the total arrears of contributions from active members was $1.072.450. the corresponding figure at february 28. 1963. was $1.133.498. despite the generally satisfactory situation with respect to the payment of contributions. as at february 29. 1964. 28 members had  paid all or part of their contributions for 1963 and prior years. under agenda items 3.12.1 and 3.12.2. the committee will be dealing with the various aspects of the status of collection of contributions. the information we are able to give you on budget performance for 1963 is provisional because the accounts for 1963 have  as yet been audited by the external auditor. in summary. $29.783.550 or 97.99 percent of the effective working budget was utilized. leaving an unused budget balance of $610.550 or 2.01 percent. as only 87.32 percent of the contributions for 1963 was collected. there was a cash deficit of $2.882.850. contributions received to february 29. 1964. have covered $2.838.816 of this sum. leaving a balance of $44.034 remaining to be covered. obligations in 1963 from other sources of funds available were as follows: from the expanded program of technical assistance. $7.062.948. from the malaria eradication special account. $814.657 ( including $4 million transferred from the regular budget). from the subaccounts of the voluntary fund for health promotion. $1.459.252. in addition. $1.106.453 was obligated for projects financed from the united nations special fund. and $96.595 from the revolving sales fund. furthermore. $2.743.533 was disbursed for the health program in the congo (leopoldville). against reimbursement by the united nations. and $670.648 for other reimbursable activities. in total. therefore. the world health organization in 1963 financed. from the various sources of funds directly under its administration. activities at a cost of $43.737.636.  including the headquarters building fund. it may be of interest to mention that administrative services costs in that year were $2.270.623. or 5.19 percent of the total funds directly administered by who. the pan american health organizationregional organization for the americasobligated $5.391.203 from its own regular budget and $5.404.177 from other funds available directly to it. in sum. therefore. the world health organization carried oit activities. financed from funds administered directly or indirectly by the organization. at a total cost of $54.533.016. administrative services costs thus account for 4.16 percent of the total costs incurred in 1963. the problem of the additional financing for the headquarters building. to which reference was made last year. is being solveda cx---317 matter which this committee will be considering under item 3.13 of its agenda. members of the committee will have ed that the executive board has. subject to the comments of its ad hoc committee. recommended supplementary estimates for 1964 in the amount of $477.650. and that the supplementary estimates be financed from miscellaneous income. the committee will be pleased to k that it will be necessary to make additional 1964 assessments on members to finance the supplementary estimates for 1964. we are all gratified that the membership of the world health organization continues to grow. kenya and zanzibar have become members. the former after a period of associate membership. bringing to 119 the number of full members. malta. thern rhodesia. nyasaland. and qatar have been proposed for associate membership. we continue. of course. to regret that two members do  participate actively in the work of the organization.. argentina and jamaica have acceded to the convention on the privileges and immunities of the specialized agencies. bringing to 47 the number of governments which have taken this action. which is so important to the work of the organization. the work of our management staff has continued to contribute to the improved efficiency of the secretariat. programs for a wide range of surveys in two regional offices were extended. covering many subjects ranging from the management of a major fellowships unit to the optimum utilization of an office building. again this year a number of offices of who representatives were visited to review their problems. methods of worh and so on. the detailed organization and execution of the factfinding stages of the organizational study of the executive board on the planning and implementation of projects was aher of the tasks largely entrusted to the management staff. the work of our management staff. as well as that of our internal auditors. at the headquarters. regional and field levels. makes a valuable contribution to the proper management of your organization. the program of further mechanization. the launching of which i referred to last year. is progressing very satisfactorily. we have  introduced mechanization of budget preparation procedures. involving the use of punched card equipment. a parallel run of the old and the new systems enabled the effectiveness of the mechanized procedures to be proved. we expect that it will be possible to consolidate the new procedures and to discontinue parallel operations this year. further mechanization is being planned and preliminary work on its application to the payroll is well advanced. these are the first fruits of our longterm approach to the development of data processing by mechanization and electronic means in the organization as a whole. with the increasing use of mechanical means to handle the routine clerical operations of the organization. it can be expected that it will become more ecoical and efficient to do such work centrally rather than on a decentralized basis. to turn  to questions of the staff of the organization. the committee will recall reports in past years on our use of the staff which we have termed "rotational". these officers. after approximatley 4 years duty in one regional office. are transferred to aher region. whenever possible being assigned to headquarters for further inservice training between. regional assignments. this procedure. has produced valuable results in improving our efficiency.  least of which is its contribution to the oneness of our regionalized organization. while continuing to provide for the development of senior personnel by way of organized courses and other methods of inservice training. emphasis has been placed since the beginning of 1963 on ways and means of implementing better procedures in order to improve and speed up recruitment. with a view to cutting down delays. a further delegation of authority has been made to the regional offices to correspond with and to recruit candidates directly for field posts. parallel to this delegation of authority. a new impetus was given at headquarters to developing recruitment sources. particularly with regard to specialities for which there is still a shortage of candidates and to candidates from countries from which recruitment needed to be enlarged. this effort will continue during 1964 and the following years. thanks to good weather. and special measures to increase the equipment of the labor force on the site. the structure of the headquarters building has grown rapidly since the last assembly. and is  at the level of the seventh floor. the last floor but one of the building. the fixing of the facades will begin late this spring or early summer. and work has already begun on the lower floors on the heating. airconditioning. plumbing. and electrical installations. with regard to regional offices. the progress has  been so striking. plans for the extension of the regional office building in brazzaville are in their final stages and it is hoped to put the work out to tender this spring. in copenhagen. the matter of an extension to the regional office building is still under discussion between the regional director and the danish authorities. as a consequence of certain legal difficulties encountered by the latter. in new delhi. discussions continue between the regional director and the government of india regarding the terms of the lease agreement to be signed for the new building which was occupied 18 months ago. in washington. the structural work has begun on the new office which will house the staff of the pan american sanitary bureau. regional office of the world health organization for the americas. as reported to this committee last year. the coordination and cooperation among the secretariats of the various organizations of the united nations system continue to function well on administrative as well as program matters. the committee will. undoubtedly. share in the satisfaction of the executive board. as expressed in its resolution  eb33.r52. that the appropriate authorities of the organizations applying the common system of salaries and allowances have taken the actions necessary to expand and strengthen the terms of reference of the international civil service advisory board. these actions mark the beginning of an important improvement in the services which icsab can render to all governments. members of the organizations participating in the united nations system. icsab as an independent. interagency body. composed of experts. will be able to make technical judgments on problems in the administration of the common system of conditions of seryice for staff. without being subjected to the pressures of immediate political problems and expediencies. and . having reviewed the financial situattoh and the administrative order of the organization at the conclusion of 1963. i should like to add a few words on aher matter of striking importance. again. as has been the practice on many occasions in the past: my remarks are addressed to you  as medical officers. engineers. nurses. or indeed as specialists in any of the numerois disciplines which comprise that vast complex we k as the field of health. but rather as managers of large and diversified enterprises in the public sector. members of the committee will recall that at the 14th world health assembly. in new delhi. i reported to the committee on the evolution of the organizations administrative thinking in the light of practical experience and in relation to the principles of administration as defined by the executive board in 1950. that report was designed to help focus attention on the importance of sound management.  only to the organization. but also to the tasks of ministries of health. the ministers. directorsgeneral. and other senior officials of national public health services. the managers. are entrusted with the responsibility for the direction of organizations and programs covering wide ranges of mans endeavor and representing vast ecoic investment. these officials are charged. collectively. with the expenditure of literally billions of dollars annually to the end of providing health services to the peoples of the world. under their direction many thousands of persons providing skills as diverse as medical officer and messenger. expert researcher and sweeper. engineer and clerk. are employed in these services. the capital investment in plant. including office buildings. hospitals. laboratories and other structures. in supplies. equipment. and materials. in holdings of land. has never been clearly established. but must surely run into many billions of dollars. such a concentration of enterprises requires managerial competence of the first order. we believe that as wi move forward into the future there is an evergrowing requirement for the development of this skill. the availability of such competence is of crucial importance. especially to those countries whose resources. whether in personnel or in funds. are limited. medical officers. engineers. .nurses. administratorsin fact all officials of health establishments entrusted with the authority to direct the totality. or significant element. of health agenciesshould be equipped to assume the responsibilities of management. these officers should have opportunity for training and executive development in preparation for service in a managerial capacity. at this stage of the growth of the national health services. the principles and practices of scientific management. so profitably applied in commerce. industry.- and other sectors of the ecoy. both public and private. should be brought more generally into the health field. this application to health is widerangingfrom the level of elementary administration. in building maintenance. records management. care of transport such as vehicles. vessels. and animals of burden. and similar activities. to the policy and direction summit which encompasses the broad reaches of command. our concentration on national planning in health is a vivid example of the introduction of the methods of scientific management to the world health organizations field of interest. one can easily visualize the value to the top direction of a health agency of the introduction of the techniques of operations research. quality and quantity control. organization and methods analysis and. other procedures having similar applicability for our work. modern techogy is bringing rapid changes in the equipment available to the executive. the alert manager of health activities would. do well to make certain" that there is maximum effective employment of the latest advances in this important area. there is a need. as well. to end compartmentalization. and to realize in a definitive manner. the close and harmonious association of all skills and elements of the health establishment. the administrative structure and procedures should be brought to full effectiveness and made a more mianingful instrument of management in integrated health agencies. a carefully structured. modernized administrative service. complementing and facilitating the basic technical effort. can be of invaluable assistance to national ministries of health in achieving the objectives of the organization. this is recommended as a point of concentration in your internal organizational planning. in one of our regionsthe americas-. we have. in close association with the appropriate services of the united nations. already begun to provide assistance in training personnel of health ministries in the principles. policies. practices. and techniques of modern management. for in this. as in so many other ways. health and the organizations devoted to health can continue to lead the way toward ecoic and social development. we of the who secretariat. together with that of the united nations. stand ready to give assistance through advisory services and other programs dedicated to the betterment of your administrations. should you so request. in this. as in all other matters in health. the staff of the organization are ever at your service. for the mal freedom of the world health organization from political pressures we are. as reported to this committee at the 15th health assembly. indebted to the existence of the united nations and its various organs. experience. as well as the charter of the united nations. make clear that the proper forum for debates on political matters. which may peripherally touch who. is the general assembly of the united nations. we continue to depend on the organs of the united nations for decisions in the field of political affairs. as contrasted with the who field of technical competence. we should. indeed. be grateful that the appropriate political forum exists. so that the health assembly can carry out its appointed task of promoting and protecting the health of all peoples. undeterred by extraneous political problemsproblems which are only susceptible to solution in the appropriate political arena. with the clear understanding that "the health of the people is really the foundation upon which all their happiness and all their powers as a state depend." the world health organization must continue unceasingly in its effortsto assist governments to make possible for their people the highest attainable standard of health as one of the fundamental rights of evey human being.
. i join my colleague in a very brief memorial to former senator jim mead. who passed away at lakeland. fla.. on sunday. senator mead was a very longstanding personal friend of mine. a very distinguished figure in new york public life. and a senator who served with distinction and then went on to carve out a new career in the federal trade commission. jim mead. who came from buffalo. was always a great figure to me because of his tremendous understanding of the problems of others in public life and his abundant and infectious good humor. the jim mead smile will always live with me. and with many others who knew him. i extend to his family my condolences and those of mrs. javits. i ask unanimous consent to have inserted at this point -in the record an article on jim mead which appeared in the new york times of yesterday. march 16. 1964.
. i have one additional comment. if i may finish my remarks. one amazing thing is the inconsistency in the argument. that any federal court would give the government dictatorial or authoritarian control. the very same gentlemen who argue this point were the most active in securing the passage of the law by which the railroad strike was settled. which was. for all practical purposes. compulsory arbitration. that action was recommended by a committee. so that the issues could be arbitrated. also. as aher example. congress restrains health hazards in mines. most of those who argue that the bill provides for dictatorship supported the legislation to which i have just referred. congress has provided for the removal of health hazards with respect to women and children. congress has provided for their protection and for overtime pay. it seems to me that if congress can do those things. it can protect the rights of american citizens under the 14th amendment. my final point: it is said that the mail may indicate that the people do  support the bill. i am in quite close touch with the people of my state. many other senators are in touch with the people of their states. the american people are deeply concerned about our slowing down programs on the bill. the american people believe the bill is morally right and that there should be effective legislation in the civil rights field. they fear the results if there is . if there is  to be a legitimate. moral. and just answer to the people. the people will try to take the law into their own hands. the american people k that. in my opinion. they look upon our work with great anxiety. of course such advertisements will stir up some hundreds or thousands of persons who will take that point of view. but we shall be failing to seethe forest. because of our concentration on the trees. and we shall be misunderstanding the national impact and the national interest if for a moment we believe there is any flagging of the desire and attempt of the american people to put an end to these unfair situations.
i point out that this provision does extend the right of appeal to those aggrieved. i call to the senators attention that in the program of grants to state employment services there is provision for hearings on judicial review. aher program involves hospital construction under the hillburton act. under which the beneficiarythat is. the hospitalreceiving a grant does  have the benefit of judicial review although there are many bases on which the surgeon general may terminate payments. thus we have a right to contend that title vi contains a deliberate provision for judicial review. and should go far toward giving reassurance that the authority granted by the section will  be arbitrarily exercised.
i would say this title does  permit punitive action by a department to penalize an entire state with respect to a program because any particular manifestation of that program has been handled in a segregated or discriminatory way within the ban of the statute. but that it relates directly to the particular activity or the particular program if it is practiced under discriminatory conditions. that may apply to one actfor example. one hospital and one grant to that hospital under the hillburton act. or a department may be in a position to demonstrate that a programto wit. the program of supporting hospital construction in the stateis so shot through with discrimination that the department should  be required to prove a casebycase situation. but may withhold money from the whole program. let me state an example of what i have in mind. as a classic case. let us consider the cone hospital. in th carolina. if it proposed to operate in a segregated way. then the secretary of the department of health. education. and welfare would be required to withhold funds from that hospital. the courts have already held that segregation in that hospital. supported by federal and state funds. is unconstitutional. let us also consider aher case. a situation in which the state of th carolina had promulgated. through the states agency or the states department in charge of its hospitals. a state regulation which permitted segregation to be practiced throughout the state. then. in my judgment. under the hillburton act. the department would be required to deny hillburton act funds to all those programs. orat the other extremeif there were a state hospital which proposed to operate in a certain way and if there was demonstrable way. in the eyes of the court. of showing that the program was shot through with segregation. the funds would  be withheld.
of course. with that understanding. that the senator from south carolina will  lose his right to the floor. first. on hospital desegregation. senators will remember that i have tried for years to put desegregation provisions in various appropriation bills. without success. in many instances southern hospitals are segregated. the supreme court recently denied certiorari in the cone case. in which the fourth circuit court of appeals had decided that the hospital should  be segregated. because it received funds from the hillburton act. and the hospital was ordered to desegregate. the hospital defended itself on the ground that it wished to stay segregated. there can be question whatever that there is hospital segregation in certain parts of the country. and that it should  be permitted. many persons have been r6fused admission to those hospitals withstanding being injured in an accident. there is a famous play entitled "the death of bessie smith." which was written around that theme based on an actual case. i read parts of that play into the record in previous debates. aher important point is the interpretation of title vi. we went over that in great detail in debate with the senator from mississippi . i wish the senator from rhode island would give me his attention. because the legislative history is important. the senator from rhode island has stated the law accurately. in my judgment. we laid it out before the senator from mississippi that this is a casebycase situation. in other words. all federal aid going to a state is  cut off if it has violated this particular section in a particular program or activity. the senator from rhode island has stated certain facts. i hope he will agree with me about the following: first. where a general rule or regulation is made by a government department under this title and approved by the president. that. too. is subject to judicial review. so that the argument as to what is comprehended within the word "discrimination." when contained in such rule or regulation. will be subject to judicial review under section 603. in short. the rulemaking power. as well as the application of the rule. will be subject to judicial review.
i would  k about the figure of nine in 1 day. i would  challenge the senator on it. my recollection is that there were about six. but the number is immaterial. there has been a rash of incidents of that character in the new york schools. which is  unusual considering the privations and difficulties under which people live in congested. ghettolike areas. one in the world has been more willingthan i to state the truth in terms of the failure to afford to negroes homeliving opportunities of an adequate character. to free them from ghettolike situations. to qualify them for greater employment opportunities and greater opportunities for training in respect of employment. to provide more effective means of educating people. and to enable us to deal better with conditions of youth delinquency and many other such conditions. but i have also pointed out that it is one thing to have a community where the climate of society and government. the money spent. the time and effort given. and the dedication exhibited. are directed toward providing these opportunities. and that it is aher to live in a community where people apparently believe that the social order requires one race. because it is black. to be denied these opportunities. that is the whole difference. unfortunately. i have run into this brick wall of senators from the south who are agreeable gentlemen in every way. but who do  see the difference and stubbornly argue it is  so. that they are better off than we are. that it is quiet down there. it is also quiet in a tombwe all k thatbut we do  believe that is the way to run the world. i say to the senator. with a sense of deep unhappiness. that this is one of those terribly irreconcilable problems in the life of our nation with which we are  engaged and deliberating upon in an endeavor to do something about it. many times have i hoped and yearned that there might be a better way to reconcile these seemingly headon intellectual differences and the differences in social outlook on this question. but only one prescription has ever been offered by those who think as does the senator. i have the highest respect for his intelligence. he and i once served uniquely as a 2man subcommittee. i soon learned of his ability. i have often prayed for some prescription which had some "give" in it. which would be other than. "leave us alone. leave it to us and by the process of education we will solve the problem." we should  leave it alone in terms of validating the constitution of the united states. i k that is  an answer to the senators question. but it does give me an opportunity to say what has been in my heart for a long time.
i was aware of the fact that the senator from massachusetts and other senators would introduce a bill which would provide for health care for the aging. though the bill differs from the one which has been sponsored by six other republican senators and myself. i very much welcome the bill for two reasons: first. it is an evidence of the fact that other senators on our side realize that there is a problem which must be dealt with. our differences will  prove to be. i hope. irreconcilable. second. the bill brings nearer the day when there may be legislation on the subject. i am  convinced that proposed legislation may have to start in the senate. because though the issue has been kind of quieted down. the fact is. based upon my own relationship to my state. it is an urgent and crying need for our older people. so i am delighted that the bill has been introduced. i feel a real sense of partnership with the senator from massachusetts and other senators who have joined with him in that they have  directed their thinking and their creative effort toward trying to resolve this extremely trying problem. which is so critically important to the citizens of the united states.
my colleague. the senator from new york. was one of the leaders in the other body in 1957. he had a great deal to do with the successful enactment of the civil rights bill of 1957. i should like to point out to my colleagueand i shall develop the point laterthat on the part iii vote. which was the key vote in the senate on the civil rights bill of 1957. 25 republicans voted to retain the provision and 18 republicans voted against. in other words. a substantial majority of republicans voted to retain the provision. had we had the support then that we have . part iii would be a part of the law today. and might have averted the public disorder and bloodshed which have since ensued.
 i am very grateful to the senator from connecticut for the firsthand information which he has given us. i should like to point out a few other cases in which we are still aiding segregated programs. i have discussed the impacted area school aid program. according to the department of agricultures federal extension service. the title negro county agent" persists in six statesarkansas. tennessee. th carolina. mississippi. alabama. and virginiaand there are separate agricultural extension service office facilities in th carolina. georgia. south carolina. mississippi. and alabama. unfortunately. the list of examples could be lengthened almost indefinitely to show in greater detail where we are aiding with federal funds programs carried on in states which continue to require segregation in such programs. to deal with this shameful factual situation. title vi does  create any new legal or administrative powers. the spending of federal tax revenuescollected from all taxpayers of the united states without regard to colorfor segregated programs is  only morally wrong but a clear violation of the fifth amendment. as the federal courts have recently clearly held in the case of the hillburton hospital construction act. in simkins v. moses cone hospital. 323 f. 2d 959. cert. den. - u.s. -. the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit held that the fifth amendment prohibited racial discrimination by profit hospitals which had received massive federal construction grants. as i have ed. on a number of occasions i have tried to persuade the senate to include an antidiscrimination provision in appropriations and authorizations for the hillburton hospital construction act. and similarly. for various department of agriculture programs. in reply to my detailed inquiries over the last year--which were placed in the congaessional record. along with the answers received on july 2. 1963. july 10. 1963. december 5. 1963. january 30. 1964. and march 3. 1964. and that includes hew when the senator from connecticut [mr. rznicoff] presided over italmost all the federal agencies and departments have ackledged that they already have the authority and even the obligation under the 5th amendment to withhold funds from such segregated federal programs and activities. the major exception has been the department of health. education. and welfare. whose dissent from the general view apparently was the motivation for including a version of title vi in the original administration bill.
. for a very long time i have taken a great interest in the problem of drug addiction as a health problem and have sponsored proposed legislation to bring that about in respect of u.s. policy. the enactment into law of the community mental health centers act of 1963 opens up a new era in the treatment of the mentally ill and opportunities for new approaches to the treatment of narcotic addiction. this legislation is based on the belief that most mentally ill persons can be treated successfully in their own communities and restored to a useful role with their families without first being subject to prolonged custodial hospitalization. at my initiative. provision was made for the community health centers to treat drug addicts who are mentally ill. a problem which is especially concentrated in metropolitan areas. three ed physicians have prepared an analysis showing how narcotic addiction could be approached if the condition were considered primarily a health problem rather than a criminal matter. the community health center has an essential function in this plan. which involves  only cure but environmental change. clinical medical management. and proper training of personnel. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record excerpts from the paper by drs. alfred m. freedman. richard e. brotman. and alan s. meyer. all of the department of psychiatry. new york medical college. entitled "a model continuum for a communitybased program for the prevention and treatment of narcotic addiction." which appeared in the american journal of public health. may 1964.
. i pointed out that this question ties directly into the bill which was passed. and which is  law. providing for community mental health centers. this has opened a new era in the treatment of the mentally ill. and. with the fine cooperation of the senator from alabama . the chairman of our committee. it allows hospital treatment also for narcotics addicts who are mentally ill.
however. a number of serious questions have been raised with respect to the department of health. education. and welfare. i raise them . the senator may  be ready to answer them . but i think they must be answered before we are through. there are two categories of cases in which hew has  given satisfaction in terms of what it can and can do about the use of federal funds in federally approved programs which are in part segregated. one is the hillburton hospital program. as to which the law itself provides that there may be separatebutequal facilities. that law has been held unconstitutional in the cone case. but to rely on a suit in the case of each federally assisted hospital would be a painfully slow casebycase proposition. certainly after congress enacted title vi. i would hope that it would  be necessary to return to court for a decision in every federally aided hospital case. also. the morrill land grant college acts contain the same separatebutequal provision. we k it is unconstitutional from decisions of the supreme court. but the hew will have to be placed in a position in which it will  draw an. intendment from the striking out of the words from title vi that it was intended to leave those unconstitutional statutes exactly as they were. so my first question is whether the able senator from minnesota understands very clearly that sections 601 and 602. as they would be amended by the package amendment. establish policy and provide for the carrying out of that policy. which would require the hew administrators to act with respect to programs which are segregated. withstanding that there is vestigial language on the statute books regarding the separatebutequal provisions for negroes * and whites.
. on monday. june 30. the american optometric association gave its 1964 apollo award to dr. peter j. salmon. executive director of the industrial home for the blind. in brooklyn. the presentation was made at a luncheon held at the new york hilton hotel at rockefeller center. the apollo award is the aoa highest ho conferred on an individual for his outstanding contribution to the recognition and service of optometry. this is the first time that the award has been made to a person connected with an agency for the blind. dr. peter j. salmon. executive director of the ihb. located at 57 willoughby street. in brooklyn. a philanthropic organization for the blind. has long been aware of the problems faced by visually handicapped personsespecially children. his own visual problems made him realize the lack of essential services to this particular group. upon being appointed director of the ihb in 1947. he inaugurated a pilot project to determine the precise services needed by blind persons who have some remaining sight. in march of 1953. dr. salmon began the first formal low vision rehabilitation center for blind persons. employing dr. george 0. hellinger. an optometrist. who is still with the agency. the pilot project and the study of the first 500 cases served by the center from 195357. definitely established that. in many cases. special optical aids and devices were of benefit to blind persons after all possible medical and surgical help was exhausted. the ihb low vision center serves only legally blind persons. that is to say. only those persons who are blind but who have some remaining useful vision. today. there are some 40 low vision centers throughout the country modeled after the program available at the ihb low vision rehabilitation center for blind persons.  located in jamaica. n.y. the need of a vision rehabilitation program is revealed by the overwhelming response ihb has received from  only persons living in this country. but from all over the world.
. in spite of volumes of testimony on the urgent need to provide a federal program of health care insurance for the aging. congress has thus far failed to take positive action on this issue. this problem will  go away by itself. and in the face of rising hospital and medical costs as well as sharp increases in profit and commercial health plans. the plight of the retired citizen who seeks health care services is becoming increasingly grave. i deeply believe that we can put off action any longer on this essential program for persons 65 years of age and older. who are becoming an increasingly numerous sector of our population. and i am determined to take such action when the social security bill reported out of committee in the other house reaches the senate. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an editorial entitled "a sop for medicare." which appeared in newsday of june 26. and a letter by james w. fogarty. executive director of the community council of greater new york. which appeared in the new york times of july 7.
the senator has put his finger on a very apt point. it is a question of degree. i could  say to the senator that a hospital does  have a humanitarian function. of course it does. it has a very special humanitarian function. when we think of all the abject poverty. the slums. and so forth. i can feel in my heart that i wish absolutely to exclude it from a state in which the state government may prove to be passive. that was the reason that i wrote the amendment as i did.
i wish to make it clear that as to the very bill that the senator has introduced. what is essentially the medicare for the aged plan of the administration. i have also introduced as an amendmnet. the bill which was introduced by senators keating. kuchel. case. cooper. mrs. smith. and myself. which advances substantially the plan that senator anderson and i sponsored in 1962. and which failed of enactment by a relatively narrow margin. the bill contains essentially the administration plan. plus the private enterprise option addition to that plan. more or less the 65plus plan. nationally applied. since the senator is serving ice on the senate that medicare for aged would be considered in respect to the social security bill. i believe it is only fair for me to serve ice that we shall expect our proposal to be considered. i would also expect and hope that it may be possible for the friends of medicare for the aged to find some way of getting together in their ideas. as senator anderson. in my opinion. in a very statesmanlike and wise way got together with my colleagues. through me. and then carried the ball. it is heartening to receive support on a proposal like this. which will be decided by a few votes one way or the other. the last time we missed by four votes. if we could attain that state of solidarity again. i would rather hope that the senator from new mexico could assume the burden. i was delighted to hear the generosity with which the senator from tennessee expressed the same hope. i am sure we both feel that way. but if that should  prove possible. i do hope that some thought may be given on the majority side to selecting one or more personsperhaps the senator from tennessee -or any senator who would seem suitable for the purpose. to see if we could again obtain maximum support for the medicare for the aged by a bipartisan agreement upon the amendment to the social security bill.
this issue is a.real sleeper. many people have the idea that it may be forgotten. and longer be an issue today. as it was in 1960 and 1962. some people seem to have the idea that older people have found some other way to obtain medical care. my whole experience demonstrates that hing could be further from the truth. what the senator has done and what i hope we have done on our sideand the bill that i have introduced as an amendment has gone to the committeewill show that there is a real bonfire here. which is of the deepest interest to the older people of the united states. their problems have  begun to be dealt with. the kerrmills act does  measure up to what is needed. it takes care of a very small number of people. incidentally most expensively. i join with the senator in the expectation that we shall be making some real progress in pressing this proposal before the senate.
as to the nursing schools. the bill is related to both hospital affiliated nursing schools as well as hospital affiliated nursing schools. but those which are affiliated with colleges and universities. is that correct.
so that those who read the record may understand. this bill also covers nursing and nursing training. but nursing and nursing training with respect to public health needs and postgraduate training. it is training that is different from that encompassed in the bill passed previous to this bill. therefore. there is duplication. these bills logically follow one after the other. public health being a branch of the professional science of both medicine and nursing which is  encompassed within either a doctor or a nursing bill unless it is expressly designed for public health purposes. it is well kn and well understood to be an area of professional competence like surgery. for example. in which special postgraduate training is required. the purpose of the bill is to take up nursing in the public health field where the previous bill left off.
i have been to warsaw. as has the senator from illis . i k something about the physical circumstances to which the senator refers. anyone who has seen the little urns with flowers in almost every street of warsaw can appreciate this amendment and the terrible suffering and sacrifice of the polish people. when the nazis sealed off two sides of a street. blew a whistle. and indiscriminately shot four or five people in the street. then unsealed the street and passed on as quickly as they had come. i should like to ask the senator a question. it is a fact that this proposal would  be inaugurating anything new in poland. we maintain a large hospital there. and we are helping the people. that is provided for in the bill. is it .
. reserving the right to objecti shall  object. but it is merely a way to get the attention of the senator from connecticuti welcome the plan which the senator has offered. i think it is most constructive to have all the ideas before us. having been secretary of health. education. and welfare. the senators contributions would be most authoritative. it is my understanding that the kinganderson bill remains the socalled administration position. i k the dignity and respect which the administration and my colleagues who are associated under the medical care bill will accord to the ideas. and which i k will prove to be very creative. of the senator from connecticut. at this time i rise only to affirm what i have said before. first. i myselfand i believe my colleagues on this side who have joined with me in the bill that we have introduced feel the same wayam determined to do everything humanly possible to make a bill providing for medical care for the aging at the present session of the congress a part of the social security bill. second. i express the hope. as i have before. on one occasion successfullyin 1962that we may find a common ground with our democratic colleagues. as we both k that the consummation of this longdesired objective is probably impossible without support from the republican side of the aisle. i extend to my colleague. for whom i have the highest regard. the suggestion that at some time before the question comes to issue. i would hope that an effort will again be made. as it was in 1962. to bring about a bipartisan bill.
. although provision for health care of aged persons on public relief rolls has long been established and continues to be improved. and although in recent years we have begun providing through the kerrmills program for the health care of the medically indigent aged. these measures are confined to dealing with dependency after it has occurred. they do  encourage or strengthen the efforts of the aged to avoid dependency or the illness that if  treated on time will lead to chronic sickness and impoverishment. public relief programs do  reduce the disadvantage of the millions of aged persons in coping with the costs of illness  ease the special risk they face of losing their selfsufficiency and being reduced to the welfare rolls by the impact of health costs. this is the kind of situation that an adequate program of health care insurance for the aging. with government and private insurance participation such as i have proposed. can prevent. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record the article on the effects of longterm illness by dr. michael m. dacso. entitled "a plea for improvement in chronic medical care." which appeared in medical tribune. july 8. 1964.
. i should like to ask some questions of the senator from tennessee. the senator from tennessee ks that. together with the senator from new jersey . the senator from california . the senator from new york . the senator from kentucky . and the senator from maine . i sponsored a comprehensive bill dealing with the question of medical care for the aged. the bill that we have sponsored. and submitted as amendment  1240 to the pending bill. has two major sections. one section deals with hospitalization and other benefits very similar to those included in amendment  1256 of the senator from tennessee. the other section. which. for all practical purposes. is a separate title. occurs in our amendment at page  63. it is entitled. "complementary private health insurance for individuals aged 65. or over." our bill provides an opportunity for both private enterprise insurance and minimum. basic. fundamental hospital coverage based on social security financing to the aged person. the amendment which the senator from tennessee has already offered does. for most practical purposes. what the first part of our proposal would accomplish.
there are some variations between the health benefits under our amendment and the health benefits under what i think it would be fair to call the considerably revised kinganderson bill which the senator has introduced.
that is true in terms of history. but it is  in terms of what is contained in the senators amendment. on which the senator is the best authority. i  pose to the senator my questions. in 1962. we contended very strongly for four principles in respect of the revision of the administrations plan as it looked in 1960. one involved the question of a health insurance trust fund. the second related to the question of the use. for purposes of administration. of voluntary organizations and associations of voluntary organizations. the third dealt with the use of state agencies. the fourth was some approachso far as it could be managed actuariallyto universal eligibility. bearing in mind that the social security system was growing. and that many of those over 65 might  be covered at present. we had in mind an estimate of something like two to four million. but as time went on. the social security system would catch up with practically all over i therefore would like to ask the senator. if i may. upon that basis of fact. the following questions: does the senators amendment  include a provision for a health insurance trust fundit does  have to be word for word the samewhich was found in the bill kn as the andersonjavits bill.
i thank the senator i should like to address myself to my distinguished friend and colleague from connecticut . i believe the senator from connecticut has given the aspect of this situation considered attention. and has come forth with a provocative and very interesting plan. i say to the senator that probably my feeling about the basis for proceeding further with his plan. if his plan were before us rather than the plan of the senator from tennessee. would involve many similarities of relationship. i k the plan is somewhat different. but. essentially. it goes to what i think is the first needed step in any really. comprehensive plan of medical help for the aging. namely. essential hospitalization under social security financing. i say that. because i do  wish my friend from connecticut to assume for a moment that in discussing the question with the senator from tennessee i was excluding the same deference to the proposal which the senator from connecticut has made. which at the moment is  before us. as i had extended to the proposal made by the senator from tennessee .
i have the floor i appreciate what the senator from kansas has said. i confirm his attitude. it has been of long standing. i k of ally whom i welcome more on the floor of the senate than the senator from kansas. withstanding the past efforts of other senators and myself. the time has come for us to take action to provide health care benefits for the aged. i believe the senator from kansas will agree that we have tried for a long time to achieve some maturity in this field and to bring about some bipartisan unity. we came closest to achieving it when the senator from new mexico and i got together. since that time we have literally gotten here. so i hope that the senator from kansas will understand us. because some of us. at least. have the feeling that the way to resume is to resume. it is necessary to start some time. and the time is .
. i hope the senator will very carefully examine these proposals. after the transitional period for those  under social security is reached. which is 1968. one must be retired in order to receive benefits. that is point  1. the transitional period is merely intended to include the period   covered. the social security system is catching up with this age level. of course. some people who are earning $10.000 a year or more may receive benefits. but. this is inevitable in a system under which we try to devise some form of universal applicability with some measure of fairness. but what is more important about the argument of the senator is that a retired person receives social security benefits whether he wants them or . a retired person receives social security benefits even if he receives $1 million a year income from investments. he has paid for social security all his life. and he receives the benefits. it is the same with this measure. except that we would provide a few years in which to bridge over the gap in the coverage of the social security system. i agree with the junior senator from louisiana on one point. that is the point that has always worried me. as to the political building up process of trying to keep the social security tax at "x" figure while the pressure is constantly on to widen the benefits. i do  want to be a special pleader. but we have a builtin limiting system. we have a private enterprise system for 80 percent of the people who can afford it and who can undertake this plan of obtaining health insurance coverage for everything that is needed other than hospitalization. this takes the pressure off the federal government for the building up of benefits. for the remained 20 percent. we have the kerrmills program. one wants to repeal the kerrmills program. we have a total medical care plan for the aged. and we avoid what i agree is a builtin danger. namely. the building up process.
. to complete my argument. i ask unanimous consent that the report of the national committee on health care for the aged. with a list of its members. the chairman of which is arthur flemming. of the university of oregon. and that part which deals with the problem. and a proposed solution with a dual publicprivate health insurance program. may be made a part of my remarks.
. taking the two proposals together. this is the major program for medical care which will give the aging medical care and which will have a builtin regulating and governing effect upon that part of it which comes from contributions to the social security system. because we will  be bidding for f an increase of benefits. any increasec benefits over and above the minimuw would come in the private enterprise par 1 of the package. as that expands and del velops. gets more people in it. and develops much more actuarial experienc and coverage. in this way. there is builtin insurance against the governmental system. or the public system. running away. for those 20 percent whose incomeand the income of all these people is. generally speaking. lowwho will  be able to afford complementary private in* surance covered under the amendment which i have sponsored together with other colleagues. to whom i have referred in the record. the kerrmills law fills in completely. because it provides  only hospital. but medical and health coverage. there is one other thing i should like to add. i brought about a symposium in march 1960 at the college of physicians and surgeons at columbia university on the question of health care for the aging. quite apart from the report of the national committee on health care for the aged. i shall include in the record that part of the symposium which is pertinent. the symposium was composed of some of the most distinguished physicians and surgeons in the field of geriatrics. as the following summary of the conference shows:
. for a long time a number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle and i have contended for a private enterprise aspect to any medical care plan. such a plan satisfactory to us was included in the bill which was voted on in 1962. and which the senator from new mexico and i sponsored. we are all grateful that the senator from new mexico is desirous that the senator from tennessee sponsor the amendment. and we hope that it will be carried. i have done my utmost to make it possible to have the private enterprise. aspect included with the gore amendment. i am pleased to say that. under the parliamentary situation. we expect to attach the private enterprise aspect of the gore amendment to the long amendment before it is submitted as amended for a final vote. the provisions of the amendment which i have described are as follows: it proposes a dual publicprivate program with the public part being the gore amendment which the senator from tennessee has described and the private part. a national private health insurance plan. covering expenses for physicians and surgeons care. diagtic and surgical services. and drugs and appliances. it calls for a nationwide federally chartered profit corporation with subsidiary regional corporations in which private insurance and group service companies can participate. private insurers would develop a plan providing uniform basic coverage nationally at uniform low rates but with regional variations. this standard insurance policy would be available to everyone over 65 who wanted to buy it on a voluntary basis. the estimated cost would be about $2 per person per week covered. and should. therefore be within the financial reach of 80 percent of our aging citizens. to make this nationwide complementary insurance possible. under conditions that would permit pooling of losses made necessary by accepting all applicants without selection. and removal of legal and other obstacles to very lowcost insurance. the proposal provides for limited exemption for participating companies from provisions of the antitrust laws and for a symbol to be issued by the department of health. education. and welfare signifying official public endorsement of the basic complementary insurance plan. i refer senators who may wish specifications as to what would be the coverage involved in amendment  1240 sponsored by myself and some of my colleagues. on page 64. beginning at line 15. which sets forth in detail the kind of physician and surgical coverage. diagtic. and other services. which would be covered by such an insurance policy. in summaryand i shall be briefthis is a national 65plus plan. without selection of risks. organized on a regional basis. and bringing within the means of the overwhelming majority of our older citizens private health insurance. over and above the basic hospital coverage provided for in the gore amendment. it is derived from the fundamental plan which the senator from new mexico and i laid before the senate. and for which we have contended so long. the reason why we believe in it so strongly. and the reason why we are pleased that our colleagues in the senate under senator gore and his associates. have  joined with us. as did senator anderson previously. is that the plan has a builtin guarantee against expansion of the governmental system. because over and above the minimal provisions of the governmental system. which would be put into effect by the gore amendment. everything else is capable of being handled by private enterprise. when we add to this program the kerrmills act for the indigent. we have a complete system of health coverage for our older people without constantly increasing the federal role.
to the senator from tennessee . i say it is most important that the senate understands that this is  a brainchild of mine. it started many years ago. in 1949. as a bill in the other body. and. interestingly. with the extraordinary sponsorship of persons like christian herter and richard nixon. it has required many years. and it has been necessary to go through many stages to reach this point of development. even so. i should say that it would  have been as authoritative as it is  had it  been supported within the immediate presentthat is. within the past year. 196364by a most distinguished panel called the national committee on health care of the aged. headed by two former republican secretaries of health. education. and welfare. arthur flemming and marion folsom. the committee also had among its members the president of johns hopkins hospital. the dean of the yale medical school. insurance representatives. and representatives of big business. i do  believe there could have been a more representative panel. the names are in the record. this is their plan. after a years study. research. and investigation. it is said that this is the answer. if we pride ourselves on the fact that we seek to use the brains of our nation. we certainly ought to pride ourselves upon what is happening here today. neither the senator from tennessee  i can guarantee what the senate will do. but it is important that the senate understand that this proposal is the creation of some of the most thoughtful men in the nation. rather than the idea of some individual senator. i thank the senator from tennessee.
. before the vote on the gore amendment. we discussed the fact that it was acceptable to the senator from tennessee and his associates. who have  prevailed in this matter. to include a private enterprise provision in their amendment which would open the activity of supplying health care to the aged to the entire insurance and private enterprise industry in the united states. we discussed the subject. the parliamentary situation at that time did  permit the senator to include it with his amendment. though it was clearly understood at the time and. with all respect. i believe senators voted upon that theory. the question i should like to address to the senator and through him to our distinguished senator from louisiana is as follows-
. again i call attention to the magnificent record of the good ship hope. carrying its medical and teaching mission throughout the world. and which is . for the moment. in safe harbor. it will be going on aher mission to the west of africa on its great lifesaving and lifegiving mission. the ss hope returned to the united states on september 16 after aher successful medicaleducation mission. this time the great. white hospital ship had been in ecuador. the arrival of the floating medical center in new york harbor brought her third voyage to a dramatic end. four years ago the vessel sailed to indonesia and south vietnam on its maiden voyage. the success of hopes privately financed teaching program was duplicated a year later in peru. last year the hope anchored off guayaquil. ecuador. and in 10 months trained hundreds of ecuadorian doctors and nurses while treating thousands of ecuadorians. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the accomplishments of project hope in ecuador as summarized in an article by earl ubell. entitled "a story of hope with a purpose." which appeared on september 17 in the new york heraldtribune.
. i shall try to conclude as quickly as i can. though i gather that more time for debate can be made available. did i correctly understand that it would be the policy in the administration of the bill to utilize those 67 counties as aids or auxiliaries in making the program work. rather than as prime recipients of the aid which would be granted under the program.
. the need for a federal program of health care for the aging has been based in part on the dramatic increase in the population of our nation over 65 years of age. much of the progress in medical science which has made this possible has come as the result of medical research financed by the federal government. the involvement of the various departments of the federal government in medical research totaled $924 million in 1963. and the outlook in the future is for increased expenditures in this field  only by the federal government but also by industry and philanthropy as well. at the same time estimates of the number of professional workers needed in the field have been revised sharply upward. this also means that we must have medical schools to teach many more doctors than our medical schools are  capable of graduating. the facts for these conclusions have been summarized by the health information foundation of the university of chicago. i ask unanimous consent to print in the record the article entitled "expenditures for medical research." as published in progress in health services. septemberoctober. 1964.
i thank the senator from rhode island. . one further point. i invite attention to the provisions for the equal employment opportunity commission. for which the supplemental estimate was $2.5 million. the house allowed the $2.5 million. in this case. it is the senate which cut it down to $1.5 million. we should bear in mind that this is an area of great sensitivity. that the evil which we are seeking to deal with has been responsible for a considerable amount of disorder in critically important parts of the nation. that we fought a great legislative battle on the floor of the senate to carry the civil rights act of 1964probably one of the most historic pieces of legislation ever passed in the senate. here. first crack out of the box. in one of the most sensitive areas of that legislation. it is the senatewhere the battle was foughtwhich makes this vast cut in the appropriation40 percentwhen the house is willing to allow the whole amount.
. as introduced. the bill contains the private sector amendment which has been identified with my name. i believe that that fact has  been adequately ed in respect to the introduction of the bill today. i believe that it should be very carefully ed because it is a critically important part of the bill. the reason is the following: first. the bill originally. as the kinganderson bill. provided a limited amount of health carewith hing morein the form of hospitalization. and concerned many people who might otherwise have supported it on the ground that the process of political "bidding up" might cause a far greater intrusion. in their view. into the health field by the government than would be justified either by the social security taxes which were being paid or by the preservation of the integrity of the doctorpatient relationship. the private sector amendment would provide a builtin guarantee that at every stage an effort would be made to do that. the private enterprise system can compete in carrying the additional responsibility. and it seems to me that that is one of the surest guarantees and assurances to those who might have some doubts on the question as to whether the tendency will be to limit the federal governments role very strongly to the hospitalization provision. second. the provision would follow the concept of selfhelp. because 80 percent of the aged. based upon their incomes. could pay a reasonable premium for health care coverageand these are the important wordswhen it is added to the hospitalization feature under social security. which is the most expensive element of the whole program. then. at a modest cost. a possibility would be opened. a great committee which i inspired. which was headed by arthur flemming. former secretary of health. education. and welfare. spent a year studying the subject and reported a cost in the area of $2 per person per month. which would come within the competence of 80 percent of the aged. leaving the other 20 percent to the possibility of the kerrmills bill. if need be. in that way. in the bill introduced by the senator from new mexico and many other senators there would be presented a complete program for health care for the aged with a magnificent role for the private sector. here is the important point. and upon this e i wish to conclude: in my judgment. the proposal offers one of the most challenging opportunities ever extended to the insurance companies of the united states. the senator from new mexico is himself in the insurance business and is fully cognizant of it. something must be done about the problem of medical care for the aged. if we are to keep government within reasonable limits. and if we are to keep the social security tax within reasonable limits. only a relatively modest amount can be done by government. that amount is estimated at about 30 percent of the total cost of health care for the aged. the overwhelming bulk of it must be done by the private enterprise system. i say to all senators. especially to the senator from new mexico . that at the time when we consider the measureand i have doubt that this is the most auspicious time we have ever had for its considerationi shall do everything i can. and i hope other senators will feel exactly the same wayto bring about a situation in which. when the measure is passed. we shall have before us at one and the same time a proposal from the great insurers of the united states to pick up the private sector option and really make the bill operative. so as to provide  only limited health care and hospitalization. but total health care. that the overwhelming bulk of the older people. especially people over 65 years of age. can pay for.
. i call the attention of the senate to the fact that on health care for the aging. the american medical association has come forward allegedly with a solution. first. i welcome the fact that at last the association recognizes that a problem does exist. however. the solution which is proposed. that the government pay the difference between the cost of private insurance and what the individual can afford to pay. is a bad one. first. because it is again a means test for the individual. and second. because the dignity of the individual requires that he shall k he will be covered. the difficulty with the ama proposal is that the individual does  k that he will be covered until such time as he has established his indigency. finally. the ama continually wishes to rely upon the kerrmills act. which has been shown to be too expensive and that too few states are willing cxi---35 to go into it with the amount of coverage that the aged need to be adequately covered. in addition. it has the defect of  assuring care to an individual before such time as he actually becomes sick. dependence upon insurance without the underlying benefit of a bill such as the one which was passed by the senate last yearwhich i am  cosponsoringgiving hospitalization is ineffective because insurance is. today. even under the 65plus plans. much too expensive. we must have the andersongorejavits bill. and i hope congress will make it the first order of business. one of the objectives of the health care for the aging program under social security which i have sponsored is to assure the independence and dignity of the retired person. it achieves this objective by seeking to prevent the individual from becoming dependent on public relief because of increasing health care costs in the declining years of his life. the ama program clearly is  a solution. in the 5 years that medicare proposals have been before the congress this approach has been thoroughly thrashed out and rejected. by its nature. the kerrmills program can help older citizens until dependency actually occurs. the andersongorejavits bill. which includes the republican sponsored private carrier insurance program. provides health care coverage at a cost which is manageable by the overwhelming majority of individuals and prevents dependency caused by extended illness. matter how we may modify kerrmills. it still remains a public assistance program for the indigent. it is a very costly program in which the state and federal governments share the expense. in new york state. for example. the average monthly cost per person is over $300. and the only way in which a state can reduce this expenditure is by limiting the benefits it provides. this has in fact happened in some states which could  afford a broad medicare program for its indigent citizens even under the generous federal costsharing formula. and some states have never entered the program at all even though it has been in existence since 1960. there are some of the reasons why in my opinion kerrmills. which is a necessary program for the indigent elderly. can become a workable program for the health care problems of the millions of aging americans who are   indigent. the proposal to subsidize health insurance policies on a graduated income basis has also been carefully explored in the past and found wanting. apart from the important fact that it would be excessively costly. extremely cumbersome to administer and would lead to escalation of rates. this part of the ama proposal assumes that private health insurance alone can do the job of covering health care at reasonable cost. the facts show that this is  the case. even the statewide profit 65plus plans.  in effect in new york. connecticut. california. texas. and many other stateswhich are among the best private plans availableeven these plans are  beyond the reach of most older persons. and their costs and premiums are continuing to rise. these plans call for a substantial deductible and for at least 20 percent coinsuranceall of which adds up to much more than the retired citizen can afford. for a couple. the premium rate alone is over $450 a year. and the states which pioneered in this plan have had to increase premium rates by almost 20 percent because membership was limited and hospital costs high. in one state less than 10 percent of the eligible persons enrolled. and of these a majority took only one part of the program because of its high cost. premiums for commercial insurance plans for benefits comparable to the profit 65plus plans run considerably higher. the inescapable conclusion is that only an approach on a nationwide scale. such as the andersongorejavits bipartisan approach. can achieve the broad objectives of a health care program which is adequate. available at genuinely low cost and which safeguards the independence and dignity of the older citizens. it is the program which best meets the recommendations of the national committee on health care for the aged. which was organized at my suggestion in 1962 and which has the potential of best meeting an urgent social need.
 might make up his mind about this and say. "i am sorry that you have adopted this resolution." that is all we could do. our only opportunity is to postpone consideration of the ination. this is  a terrible thing. after all. we are  living in a vacuum. everyone will understand that this is the only opportunity the senate has to protest against these arbitrary closings. whether the closing takes place in my state. in the state of the senator from montana . or in other states. matter where it takes place. the feeling is very deep against it. we have heard the testimony in committee. the proponents of this action have  made out a case in their favor. those who propose to close these facilities. which are important to our veterans must bear the burden of proof that these facilities should be closed. the veterans administration and the administrator. himself. must bear the burden of proof. i cite. for example. the standard which was annced by the administrator in connection with these closings. for example. he has said that the closings have been made because they will contribute to the maximum amount of operational ecoy and efficiency in maintenance. as shown by the crossexamination of the witnesses by the senator from new york . in which i participated and in which others also participatedi refer to the senator from colorado [mr. domi~nick] and other senators--it appeared clear that the facility at sunmount. n.y.. was in good operating condition. and maintained high operating efficiency. and there was reason for closing it. the effect of the closing of the bath. n.y.. hospital on medical services in that area is a cause of deep concern to me. the bath hospital is located in southcentral new york state and serves a sevencounty area which includes 33.000 veterans. the ratio of hospital bed to population in this area is 8 to 3 as compared with the national average of 2 to 7. this hospital has been operating. moreover. at a 90to990 capacity for the past 5 years. with respect to its ecoic impact. the closing of the veterans administration center in bath would leave some 2.200 people in and around a community of 6.166 people without income support. the area would be losing a payroll of approximately $3 million to $3.500.000 per year. an extremely serious blow. the village of bath has a population as specialized in the case of the aged and infirmed as detroit has for the manufacture of automobiles. the loss of these funds to an area as dependent as the village of bath is. would be a major calamity. the bath hospital is staffed with many certified specialists in fields such as pathology. surgery. urology. gastrointestinal. cardiology. radiology. and physical medicine. this hospital has more board specialists than any hospital within a surrounding area of approximately 90 miles. bath has the only domiciliary in the area and serves approximately 9 million veterans in a 10state area. the hospital has trainee programs with surrounding collegesa nursing program with keuka college. and affiliations with cortland state university. the university of rochester. the university of syracuse. and the university of buffalo. it has consultants who visit the hospital from strong memorial in rochester. and sayre hospital. sayre. pa. with respect to the veterans hospital at sunmount. n.y.. this important medical facility provides medical services for 70.055 veterans in the area. the payroll there involves $3.075.000 which represents 45 percent of the income from wages in this community. in addition. the veterans administration has spent over $2.5 million on this hospital in the last 10 years to improve its physical capabilities. in addition. over $70.000 was spent just to make the ceilings fireproof. this type of expenditure is  made on an obsolete and unnecessary facility. the castle point va hospital closing will result in a drastic loss of medical services. movement of 250 patients. the loss of 340 jobs and $2.400.000 annual payroll to the community. va administrator driver stated to me in his letter of ice on the closings that they would contribute to "maximum operational efficiency and ecoy" and "maintenance of high standards of service." i question whether the record of hearings of the veterans subcommittee bears this out. i hope that the subcommittee will recommend that the va reconsider its proposed closings and that in this event administrator driver would abide by that recommendation. we ought to make it very clear that mr. driver is a fine gentleman. his ination is expected to be confirmed. but that this is the only opportunity we have in the senate to deal with these closings. considering the ways of the senate. this is our first full opportunity to express our displeasure with this decision. the senator from vermont has shown us a mild way to do it. after all. this proposal involves a deferral for only 30 days. it would  affect mr. driver. or his future. or his job. however. it would show the temper of the senate. i shall vote to support the motion. and i hope the senate will do likewise.
. i would like to express my strong support of the senator from south dakotas amendment to restrain the unwise closing of veterans administration facilities. in new york. the effective hospitals at sunmount. bath. and castle point have been performing essential medical services for the veterans in the surrounding communities. closing of these facilities. as well as consolidation of operational regional offices of the veterans administration located in major cities in my state will impose an unjustified hardship on the veterans in new york. the hard facts forming the basis for this decision and others have  been developed. i believe it is absolutely necessary that the burden of proof for the closing of these important medical facilities and the resulting reduction in services be squarely met by the proponent. namely the veterans administration. until this full justification in the name of ecoy is set forth on the record and properly reviewed. these unwise closings should  be carried out. the alleged savings set forth in the record of hearings by the finance committee on the ination of mr. driver and on the subject of the closings by the labor and public welfare committee have  been explained in sufficient detail. and we should  accept these closings without receiving a further explanation of the reasons. i sent a telegram to va administrator driver on the day he annced the closing of these facilities. asking for a justification for the plan to close them by june 30 of this year. i have still  seen a full and detailed justification. i urge the adoption of this amendment.
much as i opposed the original provision. i feel that this is most helpful. i thought the record should spell out exactly what was the intention. which the senator has  done. aher question: with respect to the veterans administration provision barring the closing of hospitals. or even threatening moves in that direction. up to may 1. the senator made it clear that it had reference to certain named hospitals to which senators had referred in debate. i gatherand i am sure the senator from florida can properly confirm thisthat there is restriction on the applicability of this particular provision to any one veterans hospital. or more. in any state. but that it applies to all the hospitals which received ice of intention to close. there are three hospitals in new york state which received this ice. new york state is hardest hit. they would be included. i gather. with all the other hospitals to which this closing ice would apply.
s request does  go as far as it should and leaves untouched the crucial needs for greatly increased federal support for research into the causes and cures of addiction. about which shockingly little is presently kn. and for medical treatment facilities and services. particularly outpatient treatment in the addicts home environment. this is urgently needed.
. this bill is an extremely valuable and important one in respect of certain existing grantsinaid programs. the provisions with respect to migratory workers and with respect to immunization are very important programs throughout the country. i call attention to the fact that in the -immunization programand this will be important in a number of states. as it is in my statewe have made certain changes with respect to the eligibility of children which opens the program to more children. in short. we are dealing with preschool age children. instead of children under 5 years of age. also. an amendment which i offered will permit the surgeon general to relax the most burdensome bookkeeping requirements  imposed as to the ages of the children who receive federally financed iulations. the association of state health officers had testified to the difficulty which these requirements presently impose. this amendment will overcome the difficulty presented in cases in which.. through fault of one. a child requires immunization even though he has passed the age limit in the act. i call attention to the significant inclusion by the bill of measles within the immunization program. i am also very pleased that on my motion the annual authorization for the section 314 general. public health services program has been increased from $2.5 to $5 million. this proposal was almost unanimously recommended by the distinguished witnesses at our hearings and by many other authorities in this field. for these and other reasons. i k it is an excellent bill. it is most gratifying to me that the senate will pass the bill. i have every expectation and hope that it may have favorable action in the house and speedily become law.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution of the town board of indian lake. n.y.. in opposition to the proposed closing of the veterans administration hospital at tupper lake. n.y.
 the long amendment has been virtually the same in text in a number of bills.  we have a revised long amendment on this bill and still aher version on the health research bill. will the senator tell us what has induced him to tailor these amendments apparently differently from the standard long amendment. has he revised his view as to what should be done. or what is the fundamental rationale for revising the long amendment . as contrasted with the long amendment which went into other bills.
 to share with the nation the administrations intentions with respect to the retention and closing of the va facilities which were first ordered closed last january. this matter should longer be allowed to be suspended between an administrative heaven and earth. tantalizing servicemen and their families. medical personnel. and the affected communities with indecision.
. pursuant to prior agreement with the senator from new york . we are introducing a series of bills to deal with the narcotics addiction problem. i send to the desk out of order and ask unanimous consent that there be referred two of the four bills. these measures are part of a fourbill series of legislative proposals on this subject of vital importance to our urban areas. which i am most pleased to introduce jointly with my colleague from new york . along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors. including senators case. ervin. hart. kucsel. tydings. and williams of new jersey. who are cosponsoring all four bills. senator saltonstall. who is cosponsoring the two involving civil commitment and sentencing of narcotics addicts. senator scott. who is cosponsoring the civil commitment bill. and senator long of missouri. who is cosponsoring the two medical treatment bills. also introducing the measures in the house of representatives are congressmen reid and lindsay. of new york. who have long championed such an enlightened approach to this subject in the other body. along with congressmen
 johnson. in his crime message to congress this year. endorsed a civil commitment measure. i very much hope that the administration will follow through on this by either endorsing the legislation we are today introducing or by introducing legislation of its own. i also very much hope that the congress will at last act. the only action which congress has taken at this point has been in connection with the mental health centers construction act of 1963. public law 88164. at my insistence. the conferees on that measure made it clear that the act would permit states to include facilities for some treatment of narcotics addiction within such federally assisted mental health centers. the program authorized by that act is  just beginning to get underway. and it is unclear as to the extent to which the states will be able to make use of it for the purpose of narcotics addiction treatment. senator kennedy and i have inquired of the national institute of mental health and have been advised that new york state is preparing to participate in the program. one area which has received widespread attention by the expert groups should be discussed in greater detail. that is the matter of research. the public health service act. section 303. presently authorizes the national institute of mental health to make up to 100percent grants to governmental and private. profit agencies for research and demonstrations in the treatment of mental illness. in 1962. the department of health. education. and welfare advised me that there was little use of this section for research into narcotic addiction in part because the department was doubtful as to the legal scope of section 303 in regard to narcotics addiction. accordingly. the legislation which senator keating and i introduced in the 87th and 88th congresses included a measure specificially extending section 303 to cover research into addiction. i have  been advised by the department that their legal doubts have been resolved so that such legislation is unnecessary. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record at this point in my remarks my exchange of correspondence with hew.
. the record of research activity. however. is clearly inadequate to the gaps in our kledge of this subject. one of the problems is training sufficient personnel to conduct research projects and demonstrations. a provision of one of the bills being introduced today is designed to assist in the training of such personnel. there is also a lack of widespread kledge even among professional researchers. that such research assistance is currently available from the federal government under section 303. aher provision of our bills is intended to direct the department of health. education. and welfare to encourage the use of section 303 as well as other presently existing sources of research assistance under the public health service act. many experts believe that a serious deficiency in the federal approach has inhibited research into cures for narcotics addiction. these critics have said that physicians and medical researchers are deterred from participating in narcotics research because they fear that the bureau of narcotics. acting under its regulations. will proceed against them for criminal violation of the federal narcotics laws. the senate permanent investigations subcommittee in its report early this year very commendably recommended that the bureau of narcotics give further close study to the language used in section 151.392 of regulation  5. its regulation concerning physicians. such a reevaluation. made together with representatives of the medical profession. would go a long way toward eliminating misunderstandings of the bureaus policy. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record at this point in my remarks the exchange of correspondence which senator kennedy and i have had with the director of the bureau of narcotics on this subject.
. finally. a word should be said about one feature of the narcotics picture which has perhaps caused more trouble and more excuse for delay in this field than any other. hing tends to divert attention from the principles outlined above and incorporated in the bills  being introduced than reference to the socalled british system of allegedly maintaining addicts on free narcotics supplied by the government. the controversy immediately boils up over what the british system really is. whether addicts can in fact be maintained on stable dosages. whether chemical substitutes such as methadone can be utilized. or whether conditions exist in the united states which would make any such system workable. i do  believe controversy over these issues should becloud the pressing urgency for action on the series of proposals which are here being introduced. personally. i favor a limited research effort toward determining what the answers are to the arguments for maintenance of the addicts on drugs from medical treatment sources. and a few such experiments are presently under way. ably by the state of new york department of mental hygiene. but it should be clear that the bills  introduced do  call for or advocate adoption of such a system and the debate over that system and its testing should accelerate  frustrate prompt action by the congress on these measures. so critical is the problem 
. secondly i call attention to a princely act by a prince of the church. cardinal spellman. of new york. in devoting an invaluable coin collection in order to save st. francis hospital in the bronx. one of the most philanthropic acts i think new york has ever seen. cardinal spellmans action seeks to provide assistance for the construction of a new hospital but on the same site in an area where poverty is a looming presence. under such circumstances. his action lends added point to the munificent effort. i ask unanimous consent that newspaper comments on it may be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the plattsburgh. n.y.. area chamber of commerce. and a resolution adopted by the plattsburgh junior chamber of commerce. protesting against the closing of sunmount hospital at tupper lake. n.y.
. i introduce. for myself and the senator from california . for appropriate reference. a bill designed to eliminate substandard and dangerous practices by clinical laboratories engaged in interstate commerce by providing for inspection and licensing under the authority of the surgeon general of the united states. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
. i strongly favor the bill. in the course of the hearings there was an important interchange of memorandums with the new york academy of medicine. consisting of a letter which they wrote me on certain problems which will arise in respect to such a bill so far as doctors and medical practice is concerned. and to which the department of health. education. and welfare replied. giving answers to the professional and practical problems which the academy believed would arise. in addition. i have the answer of the academy of medicine to the views expressed by the department of health. education. and welfare. i ask unanimous consent that the exchange. which will be critically important in the administration of this measure. be printed at this point in my remarks.
i wish to point out that the new york academy of medicine is a most distinguished body of doctors. it has the reputation of being a great organ of public spirit and in the public interest. i therefore express the hope that the departmental authorities may. at the earliest opportunity. if the bill becomes lawand i hope that it willconfer with the officers of the new york academy of medicine under the leadership of its president. dr. john l. madden. so that the greatest benefit to the implementation of the program can be obtained from the fine expertise which is represented by this organization.
of all the bills that we have had before us. this bill deals with the most complex operations. in each of which. or in a combination of which. there may be inventions or discoveries. the purpose of the bill is to establishand this word is really a word of artregional medical complexes. each complex would include a medical school. a research center. hospitals. doctors. and professional technicians of various kinds. there may be a great variety of people and institutions who would participate in a particular invention or discovery. if i ever saw a bill in which we should maintain flexibility. especially in regard to a department which has shown such a desire to conform to the public interest. it is this one. in this instance. we really have a very complex program to accomplish a purpose. and unless we retain a reasonable area of discretion in the secretary. quite apart from the carrot and stick idea to which i have referred. we would run the risk of doing a great injustice in many cases. we would have to be wiser than solomon to solve the problem on the basis of this amendment. i believe that this goes to the very essence of the bill. the senator from massachusetts [mr. saltonstalli intimated that the essence of the bill is really such as to make it most inappropriate to include this amendment in the bill. i ho the initiative of the amendment. i have pledged. along with other senators. to carry out the public objective. we shall make it a policy which can cover the field in an intelligent way.
. my amendment relates only to prescription drugs. these are subject to control by regulation of the department. it would only affect the voluntary health care part of the bill. it would increase the amount contributed by the federal government and by the individual in the amount of 75 cents a month. each. however. it would also represent actuarial savings for the individual. the committee may have had good reason for its action. i am merely relating the facts to the senator. it would represent an actuarial saving for the individual of 25 percent of his health cost. unfortunatelyand. here. i k that i enlist the sympathy of the senator. though he may  be in agreement with me on the amendmentwe are dealing with a very high item of expense for the older peopleprescription drugs. a most beneficent effect may result from including prescription drugs in the bill and the supplementary coverage by virtue of the fact that it would have a tendency to hold down the cost. if hing else. of cortisone and other drugs which are rather high priced items. this constitutes one of the real problems involved in medical care for the aged. we have been faced with the problem since 1949. as a matter of fact. the senator from kentucky . who is in the chamber at present. was interested in the first bill which was introduced in the house of representatives in 1949 dealing with this subject. with regard to the relationship between the amount of cost to the government and the tremendous part of the health care cost for the aged which could be covered. the merits of the amendment are apparent. i wonder why the committee felt that they could  go along with this amendment.
the senator is exactly correct. a very great service was rendered by the senator from kentucky . the senator from vermont . and other senators who insisted that that concept had to be incorporated in the bill if it were to be truly a medicalcarefortheaging bill. i am grateful also to my colleague from kentucky and to other senators whom i have named for the constancy of their support in this effort through the years and the struggle which has  matured in the acceptance of the concept of a voluntary plan for which we fought. with a very marked difference. to which i shall call attention insofar as its private enterprise character is concerned. the federal government will be obligated for something in the area of $1 billion for medical care. quite apart from kerrmills care. but let us see the unbelievably great achievement which will have resulted from this development. our older people will be covered. in my judgment. for something in the area of twothirds of their medical care costs. with relatively little financial strain upon them. as a return for years of working in our society until age 65. the question as to whether one might live a life based upon new drugs and a new type of health care will longer be based upon ones financial ability to pay the bills. that great protection will be realized. and the lifespan which has so dramatically improved. will be a blessing available to practically every one of our citizens over 65. that will be a great boon to the nation. it will bring us abreast of the most advanced concepts of medical care and of welfare anywhere in the world. and it should represent in every way a vast source of satisfaction to the american people. i point out that one of the big things which the communists in return for the slavery which they have fixed upon those whom they govern have bragged about for years is the availability of medical care. we should show by the bill that a free society can do. in this area at least. as wellprobably a great deal better. considering the emous range of the facilities and professional skill which we have availableas any communist society. and at the same time we shall preserve freedom and all of the other advantages which go with a free society. i find one e of disappointment in the bill. and that is the failure of the american insurance industry to see the great opportunity which beckoned to it and to take advantage of it. at least so far. . instead of the supplementary coverage plan. the socalled voluntary plan. being an insurance company plan. which it ought to be and which it was under the bill which the senator from tennessee . the senator from new mexico and i sponsored. and which passed the senate. the proposal is  government insurance with government contracting with carriers to carry out. in the words of the bill. the major administrative functions relating to the medical aspects of this voluntary supplementary plan. i should have infinitely preferred to see the whole program carried by private enterprise. the 65plus plans. which the insurance companies. inaugurated in recent years. were a proper precursor for just such a responsibility. the supplementary coverage under the senate version of the bill will  take effect until january 1. 1967. that will give a yearindeed. a little more than a year. because i believe the bill will become law within the next 60 daysfor the insurance companies of the united states still to get together for the purpose of realizing the responsibilities and the great advantages which can apply to them and the credit which can flow to them when they undertake to discharge their responsibilities. this they could do by taking over the whole program for supplementary. voluntary health care for older citizens. which would  be possible were there  a governmental hospital insurance program as the base. but which becomes highly practicable with the governmental hospital insurance plan. which is the first part of this program. i believeand i express my opinion as a senatorthat if the insurance companies of the country should at long last propose a plan to take over the whole responsibility. thereby integrating it into the total insurance concept of their business. and giving them a strong talking point to every individual who buys health insurance when he is under 65. that it would fall properly and naturally into the same insurance channel when the person was over 65. i still express the hope that the insurance companies may come forward with a plan to carry out the purpose of the second part of the bill which we are  considering. i believe that if they should do that. congress would be sympathetic to amending the legislation in such a way as to allow them to do so. even exempting them from the antitrust laws. as we are exempting those who cooperate in the program with respect to the imbalance in international payments. in order to permit the great public responsibility to be discharged through the private enterprise system. i address an appeal to the insurance companies of the united states to realize this opportunity and possibility. it will require the cooperation of a number of great insurance companies even to carry out the supplementary program as contained in the bill.
. my amendment. which i have already submitted to the senator in charge of the bill. represents a modification of an amendment which i had printed.  299. which sought to bring prescription drugs under the coverage of the supplementary voluntary section of the medicare part of the bill. on the theory that they represent 25 percent of the medical costs of older people. i believe this to be a deserving and important change. which would result in increasing the cost of the voluntary package by 75 cents a month each for the government and the individual covered. i was impressed with the strong view of the department of health. education. and welfare that this question had to be researched rather carefully. even to write the correct definition. for example. the department made the point that common use drugs. could they be made available by prescription for older persons. might conceivably be abused as a privilege. very few persons would do this. but it is possible. it is possible to make them available to a whole family by purchasing an excessive amount of such drugs. as the whole supplementary aspect of the bill will  take effect until january 1. 1967. i was persuaded that we should perhaps proceed in a more orderly way by having the department study the question carefully. including questions which involve "name" drugs. which are often much more expensive than the same drugs without a trade name. as to the question of how prescription drugs could best be handled. i agree that the congress should get the report of the department in order to act on it in an intelligent way. and i am persuaded that this approach has the sympathy of the senator from louisiana and. given practicality. it is the kind of improvement which he would like to see made. for those reasons. i agreed with the department and the senator in charge of the bill to begin in a somewhat lower gear by calling for a study and giving an exact date of the report. namely. 6 months before the bill would take effect. in the expectation that. based upon that report. we could legislate much more authoritatively and much more wisely.
the senator from louisiana is absent from the floor temporarily. what i tried to do with my original amendment was to apply the same provision with respect to the administering of drugs to a patient in a hospital to the supplementary voluntary coverage with respect to a patient who is  in a hospital. the drugs which are given free to a patient in a hospital are defined under the first part of the bill. those same drugs are  made available to a patient who is  in a hospital. and who is under the supplementary voluntary coverage. i have tried to include those drugs that are given outside a hospital. when that proposal ran into the argument that it would be abused. i decided that the best way to go about it would be to have an authoritative study made of the problem. in the hope that if it resulted in a feasible plan. it could be incorporated before the supplementary program went into operation. so that 6 months before the supplementary plan took effect it could be made a part of it. we thought this was a most constructive procedure. in that it answers what is in the bill and what we are trying to do.
that is very important. because the intern is at one end of the scale. he is in the hospital in residence. in training. but he is a doctor. excluded are "physician. resident. or intern." meaning that he is in residencethe general physician.  there for the 3 years to practice. as it were. referring to the lines from line 25 on page 78 to line 1 at the top of page 79. we find that he would be excluded. the specialist in pathology. et cetera. would fall somewhere in between. i was wondering whether it might  help the senator from kentucky and the senator from illis. the author of the amendment. if there were inserted after the words "anesthesiology." at line 3. also the same words that appear in lines 20 and 21 on page 78. namely. "under arrangements with them made by the hospital." in other words. as the measure is written. unless the provision is tied to pathology. and so forthto the words which go in aher paragraph altogether. but i think clearly refer to itone might construe this to mean that it is intended that every practitioner in pathology or other specialty must look to the social security plan. whereas that it is  intended.
i k .that that does  fully satisfy the senator from kentucky. but at least it can be nailed down to the colloquy which. i understand from the junior senator from iowa was had between the senior senator from iowa and the senator from new mexico . by making it clear that this is evolutional by the specialists. however it may vary from hospital to hospitaletheless it is still within his control. so theoretically if all the pathologists and other specialists got together and said. "we make it a rule that we will  deal with the hospitals in that way." that would be the end of it.
the question has arisen and i direct the attention of the senator to page 72 of the bill. line 15. subdivision (f). which relates to the kind of carriers who may be contracted with in respect to services rendered under the supplementary part of the bill. part b. my question is this: will the carriers be included under this definition who are consumeroriented group health plans or will it be confined only to those who are primarily staff and representatives of the medical profession. i refer specifically to carriers of such group health-
i refer specifically to the group health insurance in new york state. will such carriers of this kind be allowed to participate in the administration of the program. i refer specifically to the words on lines 2. 3. and 4. of the bill. on page 73 of the bill. "with respect to providers of services only. any agency or organization" undertaking membership agreements or subscription contracts or similar group arrangements.
 kennedy in ember 1963.  too long before the tragedy which overtook him and the nation. he received it and commented most favorably. this report certified and consolidated the total effort of republicans since 1949 when the first bill was offered by me with certain of my colleagues in the house of representatives and through the andersongorejavits bill which passed the senate last year. this concept of voluntary health coverage with the aid of private sector carriers to give physicians and other services making this truly a full health careother than as to drugsbill can justly be claimed as the contribution which makes the pending measure truly bipartisan. such a concept was never in the kinganderson or other administration bills until together with those of my republican colleagues who joined in it. it was accepted by senator anderson and then by senator gore and is  an established and accepted essential part of the plan of health care for the aging incorporated in this bill.
yes. the question i should like to ask is: does the senator feel. with me. that there is a certain timidity apparent on the part of the united states in its policy so far. the international bankers are licking their chops over the fact that they made us conform to their views in reefing in our sails on the balance of payments. they have  asked themselves yet what they will do because of that. and where they will get their future reserves from as a result. we are permitting ourselves to be intimidated by the lowest common deinator. it seems to meand i shall make my prescription for this in a speech with the same consideration and thoughtfulness that the senator from pennsylvania has shownthat the time has come for us to do a little creative thinking. that we might break out of this timidity with some move on the part of the united states which would be of an affirmative character and would take on the problem.  with a view toward the fact that we will be in distress because we are reefing in our sails. or because the bankers have told us that that is step a. they do  k what step b will be. but they will find later we are pushing out in a way which the world absolutely demands.
i had 10 minutes. if i have any time left . and finally. the senator ks my position on this issue. the addition of a supplementary voluntary medical insurance program makes this a really meaningful and historic bill. i take great pride in the fact that that result came from efforts of a group of senators on this side of the aisle which i have had the privilege of marshaling. and in which the senator from new mexico joined. the amendment which they offered gives a wholesome opportunity to cover a major share of medical costs. i am gratified with the results in this particular area.
. the complementary insurance which is available comprises a big portion of the whole health program. the hospital costs amount to approximately 35 percent. the supplementary medical costs come to about 35 percent. leaving uncovered costs of about 30 percent. so the supplementary program for insurability is very important. i am talking about the $3 matching program. is it the intention of the finance committee to continue to exercise oversight jurisdiction so we may follow through to see that the supplementary program is really implemented. we might encounter the fact that we could  find any insurers to offer policies in the area that this program does  cover. we found that aetna came into the government insurance program. very possibly aetna may be looked to to enter this program. i would like to see the large companies like metropolitan. equitable. prudential. and the really big companies enter into it. i hope that will be done so that the benefits of this insurance will be made available to our aging citizens. and i hope that the letter and spirit of the program will be followed and that the committee will take oversight interest in the program so that there will be a place for us to repair to. in order to see that the job is done.
i am deeply gratified with respect to what was done under the kerrmills provision. the federal share of matching funds under the health programs. i believe it is most desirable. it rates high in new york. i am also pleased by the resolution of the problem of whether the programs should be administered by welfare agencies or health agencies. i congratulate the conferees on the solution. the conferees have my deep appreciation.
. this bill includes $1.670 million for an extension in puerto rico of the national institute of child health and human development. this extension will be associated with the laboratories and facilities of the national institute of neurological diseases and blindness and will conduct extensive studies in reproductive biology. i commend the committees support for a very important and worthwhile project. which should repay. many times over. its initial cost. some significant work in reproductive biology is already underway in puerto rico. under the direction of dr. richard l. masland. director of the nindb. specifically with regard to the kind of injuries or damage which can occur during pregnancy and leave lifelong disabilities. one of these studies. for instance. may indicate that cerebral palsy can be produced by interference with the circulatory system of the unborn baby a week or so before birth. this is a field about which we k a good deal less than we should. further research. according to the public health service. will focus on the early aspects of reproduction. including the ways reproductive cells are formed. particular emphasis will be placed on studies. of the regulatory hormones and neurophysiologic mechanisms that control the cyclic patterns of reproductive activity in primates. excellent work is being done in the united states in these fields. at tulane. at the davis campus of the university of california. and at the university of oregon. but the puerto rico project offers a unique way to advance our own research and carry on the objectives of the alliance for progress at the same time. puerto rico and many other latin american countries are rapidly recognizing the need for fundamental research in reproductive biology. collaboration between u.s. health research efforts. the medical school of puerto rico. and physicians throughout latin america can be a valuable link with our neighbors to the south. there is already a visiting scientists program at the existing nindb facility. under contract with the university of puerto rico. physicians from latin america have served on the university faculty while conducting research at nindb laboratories. the puerto rican medical school is today a very fine institutionperhaps the only really bilingual medical school in the world. and it too has contributed to these programs. the chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee for laborhew described the medical schoolvery rightly. in my judgmentas "a really outstanding school" and emphasized the need to overcome some of the present weakness in medical contacts with latin america. puerto rico is ideally suited to play a major role in such a common searching for health and kledge. as an integral part of the united states. puerto rico should and will participate in the steppedup u.s. health research efforts through these very worthwhile nih programs. this is a fine project which deserves the continuing interest and support of the congress. it will be useful to the people of puerto rico. it will be useful to the people of the mainland. and. it will be useful to the people of latin america. aher section of the bill is concerned with the water pollution laboratories which axe to be constructed in each region of the country. at present there is still some doubt as to exactly where the water pollution control laboratory for the middle atlantic region will be. for purposes of assigning these laboratories. new york state was placed by the public health service in the new england region. and the laboratory for that region has been assigned to boston. cornell university has asked the public health service to reconsider the placement of new york. in the regional sense. in new england. and to put it in the middle atlantic states region. which will give cornell university an opportunity to be the situs of the laboratory  authorized for the middle atlantic region. i ice the committee has stricken all funds for the middle atlantic region because site has been selected yet. in view of the fact that new york represents a significant sector in terms of population. industry. and interest in water pollution control. i urge that the state be placed in the middle atlantic region. so that cornell university. and other new york universities. may be able to bring about the location of the laboratory for water pollution control there.
. this amendment would involve a very small amount of money. it would probably involve a few thousand dollars of imports a year. it might reach the figure of $5.000 or $10.000. it relates to surgical instruments. the matter was taken care of in the house and in the senate. except as to the part relating to the fundamental anesthetic apparatus and instruments involved. i understand that there is objection to the amendment.
 of the beth israel board of trustees. charles h. silver. was added in 1954 and it  handles over 8.500 cases per year. in 1961. a modern student nurses residence and medical unit was added. and is  being converted into a new school of nursing. new staff living quarters were completed in 1963. and a new 350bed wing is presently being constructed. but. beth israel has also expanded in other ways. it operates the gouverneur ambulatory clinic. in cooperation with the new york city department of hospitals. and has recently been asked to staff all of the medical services of the new 200bed gouverneur hospital. presently under construction by the city of new york. further. in 1964 beth israel purchased the manhattan general hospital. a major center for the treatment and study of problems of narcotic addiction. this addition allowed the hospital to be redesignated a medical center. complete with a wide range of uptodate facilities for treatment of a variety of diseases. in keeping with its new position of importance. it plans to open the mount sinai medical school in 1968. with this record of improvement and expansion. it might be expected that those who have assumed the responsibility for the leadership of the centers activities would want to relax with a proper amount of pride in their accomplishments. but this is the case. for they have continued their efforts to iml prove the services they offer their community and. indeed. the entire city of new york. construction of a new cobalt therapy center to assist in the treatment of cancer is  planned. this would provide a tremendous improvement in the quality of the treatment the center will be able to offer. and it is particularly interesting that this boon to new yorkers has been made possible almost entirely by the efforts of one man. an old friend and schoolmate of mine. from p.s. 20. charles guttman. i think it is an important tribute to the strength of the free enterprise system that charles guttman could start a life in the public schools of the lower east side of manhattan. become a successful businessman. and retain his public spiritedness and interest in his citys welfare to the extent that he would finance this therapy center. which will cost over a third of a million dollars. i need  point out what a great undertaking this is for a private citizen. and how much of a sacrifice it represents. mr. guttmans gift once again proves the utmost importance of private philanthrophy today. even while we continue to make progress in bringing the resources of the nation to bear in the field of medical care and research. i k that this new center of modern therapy will be a lasting monument to hisdevotion to the people of his city. today. i want to add my thanks to that of millions of new yorkers. and to wish him and his family the best of health and happiness in the efforts to come.
 nixon also urged a 10year construction program and reiterated his recommendation for a "general program of matching federal grants and loans to assist our colleges and universities in meetings the requirements of their rapidly increasing enrollment." we of the miity join our majority colleagues in the pride of bringing to fruition together these programs to meet the nations medical needs. the pending bill. h.r. 3141. is a part of this constructive program which we all have envisioned and merits the support of all. the reason that the committee report on this bill was unanimous was that we have had a chance to consider this question for a long time. this is  a matter of first impression. in every case the miity would depend on proof that the measure was affecting a profession in which there really was a demonstrable shortage. for example we have done a little more on this bill than we have heretofore done concerning students of pharmacy. i was particularly concerned with that question. we have included the students of pharmacy in the scholarship program. that was  done before
. on behalf of myself and my colleague from new york . i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to provide for the repeal of the communist affidavit required by public law 8997. the socalled medicare amendments to the social security act. i ask unanimous consent that the bill remain at the desk for 1 week for additional cosponsors.
. i k a good deal about this subject. that is why i am introducing the bill and making a statement today. at the time the original medicare proposals were draftedand i was one of the draftsmenthis kind of disqualification was contained in other federal statutesspecifically. the national defense education act and the national science foundation actand was apparently included in the medical care bill solely as "boiler plate" language in the course of its drafting. it was  discussed on the floor of the senate. it was  discussed in committee. recent changes in both national defense education act and the national science foundation act. however. clearly indicate that congressional sentiment is against such oaths. it is my personal belief that congress did  intend. in passing the medicare bill. to incorporate such a provision in the language of the bill.
i wish to make this explanation. i understand the position of the majority leader. as does the miity leader. i happen to be on the side of the majority leader on the 14(b) proposal. i had intended to introduce this morning the alcoholism control act of 1966. for myself. senators fannin. murphy. prouty. and scott. i understand that i shall have to do it on the first available occasion. which i gather will be tomorrow.
madam president. i introduce for myself and for senators cooper. fannin. murphy. prouty. and scott the alcoholism control act of 1966. this measure establishes under the surgeon general an office of alcoholism control which will administer a program of matching grants to the states for treatment. rehabilitation. education. prevention. and research in alcoholism. the office will also administer a program of research. training. and demonstration projects through universities and other institutions and coordinate alcoholism programs conducted by different agencies. in addition. a nineman alcoholism advisory council is created to review project grants and the offices programs and to make recommendations on dealing with alcoholism. aher feature of this bill is the provision that an individual can be made the subject of research unless he specifically agrees to do so. this bill is designed to launch an attack upon what has been described as the fourth most serious health problem in the united statesalcoholism. alcoholism is defined as "any condition of abmal behavior or illness resulting directly or indirectly from the chronic and habitual use of or dependence upon alcoholic beverages to the extent of loss of power of selfcontrol over their use." there are an estimated 5 to 6 million alcoholics in the nation. 1 out of every 15 americans who drink. roughly 250.000 persons each year join the ranks of alcoholics. some 15 percent of all new admissions to public federal mental hospitals in 1960 were alcoholics. the u.s. public health service has described alcoholism as among the worst of our public health menaces. ranking behind only heart disease. mental illness. and cancer. but alcoholism does more than shorten life. taking an emous toll of those it afflictsalcoholics have a death rate 21/2 times that of the mal population. it also takes a heavy toll of the family of the afflicted individual. a toll incapable of measurement by cold statistics. in addition. alcoholism takes its toll of other inents through high crime and accident rates. the ecoic costs of alcoholism run high. it has been estimated that the cost to business and industry from absenteeism. inefficiency. and accidents. due to alcoholism runs to some $2 billion annually. indicative of industrys concern with the problem is the fact that onefourth of the top 100 companies listed in fortune are  conducting or are developing alcoholism programs for their employees. yet. despite the heavy incidence of alcoholism and its human and ecoic costs. the federal establishment today has relatively few programs dealing with this problem. and efforts in the states. while helpful. fall far short of the need. the th american association of alcoholism programs. which helped in the development of this bill. indicates that 39 states and the district of columbia have laws recognizing alcoholism as a medical problem and providing for state government financial services covering treatment. educational work and/or research. this bill seeks to enhance these state programs on a matching basis. for states  yet having alcoholism programs. provision is made for a onetime atching grant to establish such a program. this provision follows a precedent set in the national foundation on the arts and the humanities act of 1965. the sponsors of the alcoholism control act of 1966 take particular pride as republicans in this measure. our party has long manifested a constructive interest in the problems of alcoholism. the first major hearings on this subject since prohibition were held in the republican 80th congressthe present district of columbia statute was the result. president eisenhower was the first president to proclaim alcoholism information week. secretary of health. education. and welfare arthur fleming was the first postwar cabinet officer to demonstrate significant interest in the problems of alcoholism. it was he who cautioned the nation that "alcoholism is the fourth most serious health problem" facing us. and. in 1964. the republican platform specifically asked for increased financial support for combating alcoholism. alcoholism is a major menace. yet while we expend some $380 annually. to treat each tuberculosis patient. only 16 cents is spent on the average each year for treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics. the alcoholism control act of 1966 seeks to correct this disparity. it is truly a measure designed at long last to seek to conquer americas fourth most serious health problem.
madam president. i introduce for myself and the senator from vermont . the mental retardation facilities and community health centers construction act of 1966 to provide federal aid for the staffing of community mental retardation facilities. the measure would provide: first. federal aid on a declining scale over a 51month period for the staffing of community mental retardation facilities. last year. congress amended the 1963 act to provide this sort of aid for community mental health centers. and the bill introduced today seeks to pro. vide the same portion of federal aid foi mental retardation facilities. the bil authorizes $30 million for this purpose and provides federal aid for 75 percen of new staffing costs for the first 1. months. 60 percent during the next year 45 percent the following year. and 3( percent for the final year. second. further amend the 1963 act tc include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for community mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. mentally retarded children can be educated to be useful citizens. in many cases selfsupporting. and in most instances to be free of the need for expensive institutional care. if adequately rehabilitated. between 75 percent to 85 percent of the mentally retarded can become selfsupporting and between 10 percent and 20 percent can become partially self -supporting. the remainder will remain completely dependent. more importantand incapable of measurementis the affect this rehabilitation will have on parents and family to whom the necessity for institutionalization is a shattering experience. and the meaning to the retarded themselves also can be measured in moneyit is the difference between being a whole human person and being an impersonal statistic in an institution. three out of every 100 children born are destined to be mentally retarded. mental retardation is the major cause of disability among the young adults. aged 2135. who receive assistance under the federal program for aid to the permanent and totally disabled. while communities are spending more than $650 million annually for treatment. education. and training of the mentally retarded. these services fall short of the need for special training and care that is required. they require the staffing assistance provided by this bill. the mental retardation facilities and community centers construction act of 1963 would be further amended by the bill i introduce today to include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. experience has shown that the original act was  broad egh to cover critical situations. especially in urban areas where land is expensive and often difficult to obtain. in urban areas. this shortcoming represents a serious deterrent to the public and private agencies desiring to provide buildings for services. the provision to correct this situation follows the pattern of the amendment to the vocational rehabilitation act adopted last year. while recognizing that the matching formula in the present law is inadequate. i have refrained from including corrective language in my bill at this time. however. it is my intention to press in committee for reform of many inequitable allocation formulas. under present law. the federal share of construction projects varies from 33 v3 percent to 66% percent among the states. under this formula. an organization or community with modest resources would receive the minimum federal share if locxi--76 - cated in a highincome state and. conversely. a welltodo community or or1 ganization would receive maximum federal contribution if located in a lowincome state. this obviously is unfair 5 and demands correction. i urge all who are concerned with the i wellbeing and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded to join in this effort to bring to these unfortunates the care and training they require and which. all too often. overburdened state. local. and pri- vate agencies are unable to provide.
. the problem of those clinical laboratories which render inferior service continues to be a major interest of professionals in the health field. the governing council of the american public health association. at its most recent annual meeting. adopted a resolution expressing the concern of the association and its membership on this topic. enactment of the clinical laboratory control act of 1965. s. 2184. would safeguard the interests of the public impaired by inefficient clinical laboratories. this measure. introduced last year by the junior senator from california . and myself is presently pending before the senate committee on labor and public welfare. it establishes controls by the public health service over all clinical laboratories operating in interstate commerce. in addition to the american public health association this proposal has the support of the american chemical society and professional groups in the clinical laboratory field. i am pressing for hearings this year on this measure which is so important to the protection of the public. i ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the record at this point in my remarks.
. to indicate what can be done. i report to the senate on one of the most encouraging efforts in this pacification field which i inspected on my visit to vietnam. this concerns the establishment. with the u.s. assistance. of a politicalaction training school at a place called vung tau. southeast of saigon. i personally inspected three camps which are concerned in this effort. almost 3.000 students are being trained  to become pacification cadres in the various hamlets. there are said to be 23.000 men alreadyand some womenbeing trained in nursing and medical care. operating as cadres at this time. a cadre consists of 40 persons and they are really a kind of armed paramilitary peace corps. they move into a hamlet for a period of months. 3 or 4 months. to protect and to buck up the local people. and also to serve them in any way possible. they will help the people gather crops. run a health clinic. put through a road. a drainage ditch. and do whatever else may be required in an attempt to awaken in the people a consciousness of nationhood which. in the main. they do  have . the goal for this year is to achieve a force of 43.000. with the hope of pacifying aher 1.000 or more hamlets in given a figure of roughly 15.000. with a claimed 3.800 amenable to some governmental control. and a thousand expected to be added in 1966. it is very clear that this is  an americansized type of effort. it certainly does  have the priority which the situation requires. i point out. also. that there are some 600.000 refugees in that part of vietnam under the control of the south vietnamese government. rather than under the vietcong control. it is highly significant that when people have fled from their homes because of vietcong terror. they have  moved in with the vietcong. one ever looks to the communists to give them a helping hand. even the most illiterate peasant ks that if he wants bread. shelter. or security. he must go to the american side or to the side of those with whom we are working. they never go to the communist side. it is a fantastic thing. and yet somehow or other we are unable to make this count as the great political fact that it is. but there are some 600.000 vietnamese refugees who have moved over to our side. and they. in terms of the pacification program. represent a great opportunity. those 600.000 have the potential for becoming a vast cadre. they are within our perimeters. where we can give them the same kind of concern. training and interest that we are giving the cadres which i have already described. i hope very much we will attack that job in the massive way which it deserves.
 can appoint the commissioner of food and drugs. present law does  require senate confirmation for this vital federal post. the food and drug administration is concerned with promoting purity. standard potency. and truthful and informative labeling of consumer products covered by the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act and other major laws which it administers. twentyfive cents of every consumer dollar is spent for products made by fdaregulated industries. the fda. in order to fulfill its vital functions. has some 4.600 employees and operated on a budget of more than $53 million annually. it is. as its new head. dr. james l. goddard. recently pointed out. "one of the hottest of the governmental hotspots." senate confirmation of the commissioner of food and drugs would offer the congress an opportunity to review fda policies on testing of pharmaceuticals. on health standards and on other areas of consumer concern and to ascertain the viewpoint of the prospective commissioner regarding these matters. while it may have been appropriate for a commissioner  to have received a senate confirmation when the food and drug act of 1906 first went into effect in 1907 or when the food and drug administration was created in its present form in 1930. the scope of the agencys responsibilities for the publics health have since so appreciably grown that the opportunity for senate advice and consent should  be afforded. finally. i wish to stress that my introduction of this measure at this time is  in any way related to the appointment of dr. james l. goddard to replace george p. larrick as commissioner of food and drugs. at the time my bill was originally under study during the congressional recess. commissioner larrick had  indicated his intention to retire  was it kn that dr. goddard was being considered for a responsible federal post.
 kennedy created a panel on mental retardation which reported the following year. in 1963 funds were made available for state studies and by 1965 most of the state studies were complete. and since 1962 there has functioned within the executive branch an interdepartmental committee on retardation. specifically. the amendment provides: first. federal aid on a declining scale over a 51month period for the staffing of community mental retardation facilities. last year. congress amended the 1963 act to provide this sort of aid for community mental health centers. and the bill introduced today seeks to provide the same portion of federal aid for mental retardation facilities. the amendment authorizes $30 million for this purpose and provides federal aid for 75 percent of new staffing costs for the first 15 months. 60 percent during the next year. 45 percent the following year. and 30 percent for the final year. second. further amends the 1963 act to include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for community mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. mentally retarded children can be educated to be useful citizens. in many cases selfsupporting. and in most instances to be free of the need for expensive institutional care. if adequately rehabilitated. between 75 to 85 percent of the mentally retarded can become selfsupporting and between 10 and 20 percent can become partially selfsupporting. the remainder will remain completely dependent. more importantand incapable of measurementis the effect this rehabilitation will have on parents and family to whom the necessity for institutionalization is a shattering experience. and the meaning to the retarded themselves also can be measured in moneyit is the difference between being a whole human person and being an impersonal statistic in an institution. three out of every one hundred children born are destined to be mentally retarded. mental retardation is the major cause of disability among the young adults. aged 21 to 35. who receive assistance under the federal program for aid to the permanent and totally disabled. while communities are spending more than $650 million annually for treatment. education. and training of the mentally retarded. these services fall short of the need for special training and care that is required. they require the staffing assistance provided by this amendment. the mental retardation facilities and community centers construction act of 1963 would be further amended by the amendment i introduce today to include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. experience has shown that the original act was  broad egh to cover critical situations. especially in urban areas where land is expensive and often difficult to obtain. in urban areas. this shortcoming represents a serious deterrent to the public and private agencies desiring to provide buildings for services. the provision to correct this situation follows the pattern of the amendment to the vocational rehabilitation act adopted last year. while recognizing that the matching formula in the present law is inadequate. i have refrained from including corrective language in my amendment at this time. however. it is my intention to press in committee for reform of many inequitable allocation formulas. under present law. the federal share of construction projects varies from 331a to 66% percent among the states. under this formula. an organization or community with modest resources would receive the minimum federal share if located in a highincome state and. conversely. a welltodo community or organization would receive the maximum federal contribution if located in a lowincome state. this obviously is unfair and demands correction. i urge all who are concerned with the wellbeing and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded to join in this effort to bring to these unfortunates the care and training they require and which. all too often. overburdened state. local. and private agencies are unable to provide.
. medical research involving the use of laboratory animals has contributed to bringing abouta significant reduction in human suffering and death. however. it is entirely proper and practical that this research be conducted under humane conditions. the measure which i am introducing today provides  only for the humane treatment of laboratory animals but also seeks to curb the illicit traffic in them .by requiring that they be obtained from legal sources. my bill has the following principal features: first. directs the surgeon general to promulgate standards for the humane care. handling. and treatment of laboratory animals by federal agencies and by recipients of federal funds. in setting -up these standards. the surgeon general will consult both with government and private scientific groups and with the organizations concerned with the humane treatment of animals. these standards include the care of animals during and following surgical operations as well as standards for animal housing. laboratories are to be accredited and periodically inspected. second. encourages the study and improvement of the care and treatment of laboratory animals and the development of methods for minimizing pain and discomfort. this includes also federal information programs relating .to the humane treatment and transportation of laboratory animals. third. requires that animals used by accredited laboratories shall be acquired only from dealers licensed under state laws or. where the states have licensing laws. from dealers approved by the surgeon general. fourth. requires detailed records of the disposition of animals. this measure is patterned after legislation suggested by the new york state society for medical research. it has the necessary virtue. i believe. of providing the necessary safeguards for the humane treatment of laboratory animals before. during. and after research without unduly hampering scientific inquiry. scientific inquiry and experimentation has proven its worth in the relieving of human suffering. yet this need and should be accomplished by subjecting animals to unnecessary suffering. the responsible scientific community. i am certain. supports this viewpoint. as illustrated by the fact that the new york state society for medical research suggested this measure.
the joint resolution also provides. where practicable. for the habilitation of those presently unable to pass mental and physical examinations for military service. but who would probably be able to qualify for some form of national service with minimal additional schooling. or medical assistance.
. i am today introducing a bill to amend title 19 of the social security act to give greater flexibility to the states in devising their programs of aid to the medically indigent. these amendments are designed to forward the objectives of title 19 and to facilitate the effective implementation of state lawslike the current new york state law  awaiting federal approvaltheir approval by hew and the necessary federal appropriations to implement them. these programs have to be acceptable to the congress and realistic in terms of beneficiaries or much of the opportunity of title 19 could be lost to the states. a plan implementing title 19 has been enacted by new york state. but has  yet been approved by the department of health. education. and welfare. this approval is necessary if the state is to qualify for the needed federal aid. in addition to new york. seven states and the commonwealth of puerto rico have enacted and received federal approval of their plans. the new york plan. understandably the largest. has been controversial in the state.  necessarily because of the relatively high eligibility standard which has been set. but because of the fact that federal law also has kept it from being more exactly shaped to the need to be met. under the new york standards. for example. it has been said that approximately 8 million new yorkers could qualify as medically indigent. in response to the widespread concern about the new york plan. i arranged a meeting of the new york congressional delegation on june 2 in washington with gover rockefeller and his associates. and under secretary wilbur cohen. subsequently. i have been in frequent contact with under secretary cohen. state officials. and certain of my colleagues here in an effort to get approval for a proper new york plan. in order to make this plan more acceptable. it is desirable to remove some of the directives of the federal law which have increased the cost of the new york program. the bill which i introduce today. therefore. amends title 19 in the following respects: first. the federal law  provides that a deductible feature in any state plan would be acceptable so far as medical bills are concerned. but it could  be required with regard to hospital bills. my amendment will eliminate the prohibition with reference to hospital bills. this would allow new york state to revise the plan. for example. to provide that 20 percent of income over the present eligibility levels-$5.300 for hospital bills and $4.700 for medical and hospital billsbe used for health expenses before the state with federal aid would provide supplements. second. the federal law requires that income eligibility standards be the same throughout the state. this does  take into account differing costs in geographic regions. and my amendment would allow the state plan to make such distinctions where necessary and practical. third. the federal law provides that identical benefits must be made available to all persons who qualify for aid. this means that new york can distinguish. for example. between the needs of a blind and disabled person over 65. and a healthy unemployed father aged 28. giving the state plan more flexibility in this area would allow it to reduce costs considerably. and my amendment would permit such a change. let me emphasize that i was an early supporter of medical care for the aged and federal assistance to states aiding the medically indigent of all ages. these amendments are  intended to impair that objective but they will ameliorate the criticism which threatens  only the approval of new yorks plan but the implementation and financing of title 19 programs throughout the nation.
. i have read the address of the distinguished majority leader delivered at yeshiva university in new york city today. i think it is a highly creditable presentation of the situation by one of our most distinguished senators and national leaders. i wish to emphasize the critical importance of the confrontation which the senator from montana seeks between secretary of state rusk and the chinese foreign minister. so that within the framework of negotiations for peace in vietnam the real party in interest. communist china. may be negotiated with. i have urged generally the same thing. but this is a most impressive and important presentation. i am very hoed. as the senator from new york. that senator mansfield has chosen to make this statement before so distinguished a university. which houses one of the most distinguished medical schools. mathematics schools. and business schools in my state. i am pleased and i utter these words in appreciation as well as approval.
. i introduced the humane laboratory animal treatment act of 1966. s. 3218. patterned after legislation suggested by the new york state society for medical research. which seeks the same objectives as the bill  before us which the senator from oklahoma is discussing. i am glad to see the pending bill before the senate and. of course. i support it. i do have one question. the fact is that the bill does leave to the researcher himself the decision as to when the animal is for experimental purposes. as we k. there are also big institutions. foundations. research agencies. and hospitals involved. the view of the senator from oregon is very impressive on this point. can the senator from oklahoma assure us that at least the department of agriculture will make itself helpful to agencies charged with this decision. that we will see to that through legislative oversight. and that if there is coordination necessary with hew for medical and research decisions the department of agriculture will seek that kind of coordination.
. indicative of the growing awareness throughout the nation of the problem of alcoholism is the series of four articles by tom conly and cliff smith which appeared in the rochester. n.y.. timesunion. the statistics of alcoholism are grim5 to 6 million alcoholics. the nations fourth most serious health problem. shortened life span. and an alcoholic death rate 21/2 times that of the mal population. and a cost to business and industry of some $2 billion annually. but incapable of measurement by any statistics is the heavy burden on the family and friends of the afflicted individual. and alcoholism takes a further toll of inents through high crime and accident rates. especially accidents on the nations highways. early this year i introduced the alcoholism control act in 1966s. 2834to establish a research and federal grantinaid program for the treatment. education and prevention of alcoholism. this measure is presently pending before the senate subcommittee on health. and i am hopeful that consideration may be given to it within the year. the rochester timesunion merits the approbation of the community for its series of articles. it has rendered a public service in an area where greater public understanding can be the means to achieving effective progress. i ask unanimous consent that the series of four articles may be printed in the record. . there being objection. the articles were ordered to be printed in the record. as follows: [from the rochester (n.y.) timesunion.
. a number of editorials appeared today supporting the statement i made in the senate yesterday concerning the need for new legislation to protect the public interest in strikes which imperil the public health or safety. i ask unanimous consent that these editorials be printed in the record.
. on january 17 of this year. i offered. together with my colleagues. senators kennedy of new york. morse. clark. hartke. tydings. and young of ohio. a bill to repeal that section of the 1965 act which requires the disclaimer. at that time. i expressed the view that this provision was  intended by the original drafters of the medicare legislation and that such a requirement was burdensome. demeaning. and unjust as applied to the 2 million older americans it affects. i had a very close and direct hand in the enactment of the medicare legislation and i think i have a right to some testimony as to what it was intended to cover. recently. upon the request of the senate finance committee. the department of health. education. and welfare expressed their support of my bill. s. 2776. on the condition that it be broadened in certain respects to repeal preexisting sections of the social security act dealing with medical social security benefits. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the departments letter be printed in the record.
i think we have gotten down to the point of whether we do anything in this matter or do . and whether we do somethingand this is strange coming from me on the miity sidewhich accords the presidents views dignity and respect. again evaluating the record that we have before us and what secretary wirtz has had to say. it seems irrefutable that the socalled morse approach. which we have in effect cut down to de minimis. is preferable to the clark approach. which gives him. the president. the authority to use it immediately. for whatever reason. whether the president is worried about a national emergency or whether he does  want to offend the union. it is immaterial at this point. the fundamental point is this. it is my distinct judgment on the record. on what secretary wirtz has said. on the opinion of the attorney general on the constitutionality of the clark approach. that the president prefers the morse trigger. so in an effort to meet that desire. by providing that the president may extend the period which. after 30 days. expires unless the president acts. and then in 60 or 90 days it again expires unless the president acts. it gives the president complete discretion. i understand the argument of the senator from rhode island in seeking to pin on anyone who backs the substitute the label of strikebreaker. i have been through that before. it was charged against me in the medicare bill. when i teamed up with the senator from new mexico . i was charged at that time with voting against a liberal measure. as the senator from michigan will confirm. the label on a package is  conclusive as to its contents. the measure before us is  a strikebreaking measure. it is a resolution to prevent a strike. and provides a time limit within which that prevention may take place. it does  inhibit the employees in their right of collective bargaining. under the substitute we are coming to a point. completely compatible with safeguarding the public interest. of proposing a measure which is designed. so far as we can divine the views of the administration. to protect the public interest. to me it is a fair solution in a case where the senate has said we must act. it has passed the constitutional point the attorney general raised. it reaches. to some degree at least. so far as we can divine. what the president desires. therefore i hope that the proposal prevails.
. institution by the department of justice last month of a major antitrust suit against the college of american pathologists alleging controls over laboratories and test fees resulting in higher prices to patients brings to the fore again the question of how well the public interest is being served by the nations 20.000 commercial medical laboratories. these are the laboratories which conduct bioanalytical tests on material obtained from the human body. including blood and tissue samples. and render reports on their findings which are of vital importance in the diagis and treatment of patients. while the justice department is concerned with the ecoic aspects of the operations of medical laboratories. as a result of many published reports regarding incorrect findings by these laboratories. i became concerned with the public health aspects of their operations. based on this concern. last year i introduced legislation to eliminate substandard and dangerous practices by medical laboratories engaged in interstate commerce by providing for inspection and licensing by the surgeon general. this bill. the clinical laboratory licensing act of 1965 . is presently pending before the subcommittee on health of the senate commitee on labor and public welfare. the american chemical society. the professional organization representing many of the medical technicians. supports s. 2184. the societys committee on clinical chemistry has stressed that federal regulation of the interstate shipment of specimens and materials to and from clinical laboratories is vitallly needed. most recently. the american chemical society underlined the importance of the early enactment of this medical laboratory control legislation when it indicated: it seems imperative. therefore. that some means be established to assure that such materials [human biological specimens] sent between states are directed only to the most qualified laboratories. at least. the public welfare would so seem to require. the operative phrase here is the requirement of the public welfare. logic commends the conclusion that. if the federal government on behalf of the consuming public is taking steps with respect to the ecoic operations of these laboratories. then a complementary step should be undertaken with respect to the technical operations of these laboratories. also in the interest of the consuming public. it is for this reason that i again urge early and favorable interest by members of the congress in my proposal to effect appropriate public health controls. the clinical laboratory licensing acts. 2184. the public interest requires such action.
. i just wish to state to the senate that the amendment to section 207 of this bill. .which relates to questions of hospital "management and desegregation. et cetera. is being considered by the managers .of the bill. we have submitted to them. on behalf of myself and senator kennedy of massachusetts. a proposed revision of the section. somewhat later in the aftern. i hope we will raise that question. as may be appropriate.
. i am grateful to the senator. it would be more orderly to do it this way. although i can wait. let us get to the substance. aside from the protocol. which i throw aside. i assure the senator from mississippi it is meaningless to me whether he changes his amendment or whether he uses the amendment i have. the amendment as originally before us was an invitation to hospitals to avoid the impact of desegregation because it would have prevented the hew from withholding funds in order to formulate or administer any program whereby any requirement was imposed if doctors certified it would be helpful to the patient. of course. if a hospital wanted to segregate there could be wholesale certification by the medical officers and that would have been the end of that. and the hew would have been compelled to support that hospital under section 207. as we got it from the committee. i am  saying that they understood clearly what was going to happen. but the fact is that is what was going to happen under section 207. so. it was the alarm bell for me and many others. as in the case of the wideopen invitation on pupil placement or pupil eligibility. this would have been a loophole for hospitals to escape from the direct provisions of the law. by elimination of the words "to formulate or administer any program whereby any requirement shall be imposed." we have gotten away from that specific pointthat is. that hew would be trimmed out of being able to enforce the desegregation aspect of the law so far as the officials were concerned. we are at a narrower point but. etheless. a significant one. the narrower point is this. that if we left the amendment which i have drafted. with the senator from massachusetts . the senator from pennsylvania . and the senator from new jersey . leaving out the words "or accountability" and following a different course. that hew could deny a hospital the medicare program. for example. on the ground that that hospital was segregated. and hing in this section would have prevented that. on the other hand. if hew gave a hospital money on the ground that it was desegregated. that particular hospital. by certification of the two medical officials. could refrain from putting a negro patient in a room inhabited or occupied by two or three white patients on certification that it would harm them. but the hospital would. otherwise. be certified and hew would  be able to deduct anything from the money it was paying because of that particular restriction. i saw hing terribly wrong with that. i did  like it. i was  happy with it. i would have preferred to leave section 207 out. just as would the senator from rhode island .. but. nevertheless. i saw hing greatly wrong with it. it has been adopted by the senate. but by adding the word "accountability" it opens the loophole that a hospital. without any "why" or imaybe" or "wherefore." can certify 84 patients. 92 patients. or 160 patients in that condition of "accountability." they can even ask them. all they have to do is present the certifications. period. that is it. i do  think anyone intends that. i do  think we want that. i do  think it is necessary. the fact is. hew is administering this particular medicare program right  in exactly the way we would write it into law if we left out the words "or accountability." in my judgment. if we leave out the words "or accountability." so that we can ask them what they are doing. how many patients there are. or take a look at it. at least we are bound by the certifications. it is true. but we can look over their shoulders as to what they are doing with it. they are  without accountability. therefore. if we leave it as i have proposed together with my colleagues to amend it. without the words "or accountability" we take care of every contingency that needs to be taken care of. and we prevent hew from enforcing a requirement. as it properly says. where medical authorities think it should  be enforced as to the individual. and by certification of the doctors. that is  chargeable to them. it does  cost them anything. but we still allow hew to find out how many people there are. the number of certifications. whether they are being abused or  being abused. i can see emous problems if there is accountability or requirement to report. in order to justify what they are doing. so that this thing can be used in a most wholesale way in defiance of the very thing we are trying to accomplish.
the senator is using the word "accountability" in its financial sense. the hospital shall  be charged with any abatement of what it gets out of the program by virtue of what it had to do about that patient. unfortunately. the reach of the word "accountability" is much broader than that. i respectfully submit to my lawyer friends in the senate. if we left it as it is. to impose or enforce any requirement. then. ipso facto. i just say that there could be a deduction for the amount involved in that particular patient. but if we add the words "or accountability." then we do  even give hew an opportunity to determine that this is actually being done.
. i would like to get this clear from the sponsor of the amendment and the senator from massachusetts . let us understand that the department of health. education. and welfare is  obliged to give funds to a hospital unless it is desegregated. we are providing that hospitals may . perhaps as a condition of very individual necessity. force a patient to go into a desegregated room. because this is essential for the health of the patient.  we want to add a further fact that. in order to certify to that fact in an individual case. two doctors must do so. it is understood. however. that hew is . by this provision. going to be required to give money under medicare and other programs to a hospital which substantially has been segregated. or will continue to get money if it becomes substantially segregated. and that we are dealing in these instances only with individual cases.
we are dealing with individual cases. we are dealing with good faith and on an individual basis. and  on a mass basis used as a subterfuge to keep hospitals segregated. that is how we expect it to be administered. is that correct.
would  the senator do this just as well. if. instead of the word "accountability." which is a word which causes some of us trouble. he could use the phrase "and the requirement as to any certified patient." and go on with the rest of it. showing how such patient is certified. in that case.  only would the requirement be enforced. but it would relate to the specifically certified patient. we understand the situation deals with a medical condition. and that it is . as the senator from rhode island has said. a pattern or practice. on that basis. it seems to me we would be able to deal with it.
. that the only way we can protect ourselvesthose of us. as i say. on this side of the argumentagainst such an eventuality. is to condition this upon there being pattern or practice involved. if there is pattern or practice involved. then you can deal with medical exceptions. but if it results in a pattern or practice. then hew has to have absolute freedom to look behind it.
may i say to the senator that when i said we have to take a little chance with this. in deference to the views of a number of our fellow senators. i had in mind that there may be more individual exceptions than we have any right to except. but that is a very different thing from the pattern or practice proposition. which would mean you do or do  have to give federal money to a particular hospital. i wish to leave hew free to deny money to a hospital where exemptions are so wholesale as to invalidate the purpose of the law.
. many of us have contended for years in the senate that the only way in which we would ever be able to deal with these problems is on the financial side. hospitals who are looking for money from the federal government should  get it unless they show that they meet the policy of the constitution. it seems to me that. under this particular provision. the hospitals would be able to eliminate from the coverage of the law those patients who have received a certificate from medical officers who. as the senator from pennsylvania has properly pointed out. are themselves under the particular mores of their community. if we leave the definition concerning certification as loose as we do here. all that a doctor would have to do would be to certify that his patientwho is also a person accustomed to these mores of the particular areais suffering from a physical or mental condition to such an extent that it would work a hardship on that person if he were integrated with a person of aher race. i can see why any doctor could  execute a certificate under those circumstances with respect to any patient. it seems to me that we are just creating a situation here in which the hew would be unable to deny federal funds to a hospital. matter how many patients were eliminated from the coverage of the act because of this provision. for all practical purposes. a hospital would be segregated under those circumstances. we seem to be defeating our aim. i was willing to go along with this when i proposed the amendment to deal with the matter of imposing or enforcing requirements. if the hew were to give money to a hospital because the hospital was desegregated. they could  then impose the condition that that hospital could  exempt particular patients. however. if it was discovered at a later date by hew that that hospital for practical purposes was administering this provision of the law in such a way as to again become segregated. they could cut off their funds. if we were to remove the matter of responsibility. hew would  be able to ascertain whether a hospital was actually segregated or . the law would be applicable only to those patients who had certification. it would be very easy for a hospital to segregate 90 percent of the patients. and as long as the other 10 percent of the patients are  segregated. the funds would be supplied. i am willing to stand by my original understanding and the understanding of the senator from pennsylvania . and the senator from new jersey . i do  want to move to strike section 207. but it seems to me to be my duty to strike the words which have been added to the amendment. if these words were stricken. i think that we could perhaps live with the provision for a year. i do  say that the senator intends the provision to act in this mannerand i am sure that he does but this provision would void the entire purpose that we are seeking to effectuate. therefore. in good conscience. i can go along with it.
i k. it would read as follows: funds appropriated by this act sh all be used to impose or enforce any requirement on any hospital or other medical facility as to an individual beneficiary which is contrary to the beneficiarys physical or mental wellbeing as certified by the attending physician and the chief medical officer of the facility. or the acting medical officer. that is precisely the amendment which the senator from pennsylvania and. the senator from massachusetts. and the senator from new jersey and i had agreed to submit by way of revision of section 207. . we have been discussing this matter for some time. and i shall be brief. first. i should like to make a parliamentary inquiry. at what point in the proceedings is a motion to strike section 207 in order. in the existing parliamentary situation.
i agree with the senator. i think that is the right course. and i think that i can state in 2 minutes why i think so. the amendment as i have  revised it. which is the original draft that we had earlier today. would say to the hew: when you. give money toa. hospital. that hospital having been desegregated according to your requirements. you may  impose as a condition to that hospital that individual may be denied entry to a particular private room or ward where you have a situation of certification as to physical and mental well being of some other patient in that ward. also. we will  be saying to the hew: having once gone into or approved the plan for a particular hospital. you may  withdraw that plan if you find that hospital is. for practical purposes. segregated. what hew may  do is to say to the hospital: unless you stop your practice of these certifications. we are going to withdraw our money. but if hew is satisfied that the hospital. for all practical purposes. is segregated. then it may withdraw its resources. i on that basis. the way this amendment would then read. it would take care of medical exceptions but would  allow a hospital to carry out a program of segregating itself under the guise of this amendment. which it could do if the amendment of senator stennis were accepted. and i represent that to the senate as my deeply convinced opinion as a lawyer.
. a major health crisis is facing the nation. medical facilities are inadequate and there are serious shortages of health personnel as we are faced with an expanding call for medical services due to increased longevity. population growth. and better ability to pay for medical care. and medical care costs are rising faster than other elements in the cost of living. the june 1966 cost of living stood at 112.9195759=100while medical care costs were 127 as compared to 113.9 for food. 109.4 for apparel. 111.1 for housing. and 112.2 for transportation. and. unless we act . the health care crisis in many of its manifestations will continue. we are currently short some 50.000 physicians. even with the presently anticipated small increases in medical school graduates and the "importation" of some 1.600 foreign medical school graduates. the united states will still be short at least the same number of 50.000 doctors in 1970 due to population increase. the country is moving. it is truebut we are moving in place. in the face of these shortages. we should  in good conscience appropriate less money than has been authorized for medical education.
. i should like to refer to section 8grants for costs of initiating services in community mental retardation facilities--of s. 3008. which would extend to facilities for the mentally retarded the same kind of federal assistance that is  authorized to meet initial staffing costs at community mental health centerspublic law 89105and at sheltered workshops and rehabilitation facilitiespublic law 89this provision had its genesis in s. 2836. the mental retardation facilities and community mental health centers construction act amendments of 1966. a bill i introduced on january 26. 1966. for myself and the distinguished junior senator from vermont . we later on march 15 introduced this proposal as an amendment to s. 3008. the measure  before the senate. mentally retarded children can be educated to be useful citizens. in many cases selfsupporting. and in most instances to be free of the need for expensive institutional care. if adequately rehabilitated. between 75 to 85 percent of the mentally retarded can become selfsupporting and between 10 and 20 percent can become partially selfsupporting. the remainder will remain completely dependent. more importantand incapable of measurementis the effect this rehabilitation will have on parents and family to whom the necessity for institutionalization is a shattering experience. and the meaning to the retarded themselves also can be measured in moneyit is the difference between being a whole human person and being an impersonal statistic in an institution. three out of every 100 children born are destined to be mentally retarded. mental retardation is the major cause of disability among the young adults. aged 21 to 35. who receive assistance under the federal program for aid to the permanent and totally disabled. while communities are spending more than $650 million annually for treatment. education. and training of the mentally retarded. these services fall short of the need for the special training and care that is required. they require the staffing assistance provided by this javitsprouty amendment. as modified.  part d of the bill. the mental retardation facilities and community centers construction act of 1953 is further amended by the javitsprouty provision to include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. experience has shown that the original act was  broad egh to cover critical situations. especially in urban areas where land is expensive and often difficult to obtain. in urban areas. this shortcoming represents a serious deterrent to the public and private agencies desiring to provide buildings for services. the provision to correct this situation follows the pattern of the amendment to the vocational rehabilitation act provided last year. section 8 of s. 3008 is a welcome and constructive addition to the law and will serve to bring to the unfortunate mentally retarded the care and training they require which. all too often. overburdened state. local. and private agencies are unable to provide.
 kennedy. in response to our repeated requests. convened a white house conference on narcotics and drug abuse and a concerned federal effort began to meet the problem. today. with senate passage of this bill we will be embarking on a whole new approach to the treatment of addicts. it is  a matter of pride to me that the state of new york is the home of 47 percent of the nations addicts. but the statistic does underscore my personal concern. in new york. we passed the first law in the nation providing for the civil commitment and treatment of addicts and have increasingly set aside and constructed facilities for the institutional and aftercare facilities needed to make such a program meaningful. i ask unanimous consent that the text of a report to the new york state narcotic addiction control commission on the state department of mental hygienes narcotic addiction treatment program be printed at this point in the record. together with a statement from gover rockefellers office summarizing the report.
. i am very gratified that the provision.for medicines in the voluntary part of the medicare program is at long last included in the law. when the medicare measure was before us originally i moved for such an amendment and i did my utmost to get it adopted. but it was defeited: sometimes it takes a while around here for justice to catch up with the law. and in this case it has. i congratulate the senate from louisiana for including this provision. he told me at the time that if experience warranted it he would include it. and he did so in this bill. i extend to the senator my appreciation.
. this bill contains two provisions which are of special interest to our older citizens. both were the subject of discussion during consideration of the social security amendments act of 1965the medicare law. the first provision is designed to retain the special medical expense deduction which was available to older citizens before passage of the medicare act. prior to that. persons over 65 could deduct all medical expenses without regard to the 3percent floor. last years law mandated an end to that special treatment. beginning in 1967. and placed older citizens in the same category as other taxpayers. today. we forestall that change and retain. for the american over 65. this important deduction. the second provision is of particular interest to me. since i originally proposed it as an amendment to the social security act of 1965. this provision provides for the coverageunder medicareof the cost of out of hospital prescription drugs. while drugs admins* tered in the hospital were covered under part a of medicare. provision was made. in last years law. for reimbursement for the cost of drugs needed by the outpatient older citizen. as the committee report shows. these drugs represent a significant portionperhaps 25 percentof the health costs of older citizens. in 1963. the national committee on health care for the ageda group of health and insurance experts which i helped to organizeproposed a program to cover outofhospital health care which was the forerunner of the present part b. this proposal. which i introduced as a bill that year. covered prescription drugs administered outside a hospital. last year. i offered this coverage as an amendment to the medicare bill and testified before the finance committee urging its inclusion. it was opposed. at that time by the department of health. education. and welfare. which asked for time to study the operation of the new law before recommending expansion of coverage. i am most pleased that the senate is acting on this proposal today. and ask unanimous consent that my testimony before the finance committee on this subject be printed at this point in the record. together with certain excerpts .1965. dealing with the matter.
. my amendment relates only to prescription drugs. these are subject to control by regulation of the department. it would only affect the voluntary health care part of the bill. it would increase the amount contributed by the federal government and by the individual in the amount of 75 cents a month. each. however. it would also represent actuarial savings for the individual. the committee may have had good reason for its action. i am merely relating the facts to the senator. it would represent an actuarial saving for the individual of 25 percent of his health cost. unfortunately -and. here. i k that i enlist the sympathy of the senator. though he may  be in agreement with me on the amendmentwe are dealing with a very high item of expense for the older peopleprescription drugs. a most beneficent effect may result from including prescription drugs in the bill and the supplementary coverage by virtue of the fact that it would have a tendency to hold down the cost. if hing else. of cortisone and other drugs which are rather high priced items. this constitutes one of the real problems involved in medical care for the aged. we have been faced with the problem since 1949. as a mater of fact. the senator from kentucky . who is in the chamber at present. was interested in the first bill which was introduced in the house of representatives in 1949 dealing with this subject. with regard to the relationship between the amount of cost to the government and the tremendous part of the health care cost for the aged which could be covered. the merits of the amendment are apparent. i wonder why the committee felt that they could  go along with this amendment.
. gover rockefeller of new york last week annced a plan whereby the state would participate in the cost of expanding medical student enrollments at new yorks private medical schools. this proposal. which goes into effect beginning with the 196768 academic year. serves as an outstanding example of a states accepting its responsibility in meeting the health crisis facing the nation. the program also stands in marked contrast to the administrations lag in meeting the federal governments responsibility. the health professions education assistance act contains a provision for aid to medical schools very similar to what is being done in new york. whereby congress is authorized to appropriate $40 million for the current fiscal year for education improvement grants. however. despite the fact that the public health service. realizing the need. requested the full $40 million authorized. the administration requested only $30 million. 75 percent of the authorization. this administration cut means that while the basic grants for all health professions schools eligible under the law will be fulfilled completely. funding is available for the special improvement grants going to the schools with the greatest need. the purpose of these special improvement grants is to "help to insure adequate preparation of all future physicians and dentists. thereby increasing the quality of medical care available to the people." clearly. the appropriation request was insufficient. i ask unanimous consent to include in my remarks the text of gover rockefellers anncement of this proposal.
madam president. i just wish to call attention to the fact that there is an emous shortage of nurses. major testimony was given on this bill that we had to do something for nursing as one of the allied health professions which had the greatest difficulty. the effects of the nursing shortage are unbelievable. at this point. i should like to refer to my amendment. originally introduced on september 1 as amendment  787. which has been incorporated into h.r. 13196 as section 8 of that measure. this provision is designed to help relieve the critical shortage of nurses which is seriously threatening patient care throughout the nation. this nursing shortage is widespread and universal. striking both affluent and affluent communities. the cities. the suburbs. and rural areas alike. as the hearings demonstrate. the department of health. education. and welfare estimates the nursing shortage at 125.000. in new york city. for example. 25 percent of the registered nursing positions in 150 private hospitals are unfilled. for the citys 21 municipal hospitals. the situation is more drastic60 percent of the positions are unfilled. just last week. the new york times carried the revelation that at the queens hospital center in new york city. state health officials found 15 staff nurses on duty for 1.039 patients one aftern. due to the nurse shortage. the centers recovery room is closed on weekends and patients are transferred directly from the operating room to understaffed wards. i ask unanimous consent that the times article be printed with my remarks at this point:
briefly explained. my amendment. as found in section 8. first. establishes a new scholarship programopportunity grants for nursing educationfor needy nursing students. second. establishes a new program to encourage young people to enter into the nursing profession. and third. permits funds under the nurses training act for associate degree and diploma programs to be interchangeable with funds for baccalaureate and higher degree programs. and vice versa. in instances where either one of the programs has insufficient applications and the other is unfunded. the scholarship program is one of the few remaining unfilled recommendations of the surgeon generals consultant group on nursing which issued its report. "toward quality in nursingneeds and goals." in february 1963. .other principal recommendations in the report were brought to fruition in the nurses training act of 1964. but. important as the nurses training act and these new amendments are. legislation alone is insufficient to relieve the nursing shortage. as mrs. judith g. whitaker. executive director of the american nurses association. recently wrote me: low salaries have had in the past. and continue to have. adverse influence on the ability of health care facilities to recruit and retain adequate numbers of registered nurses. immediate and substantial ecoic improvements must be made if nursing services of the quality and quantity required in modern medical care are to be provided. the house of delegates of the american nurses association this summer adopted a national annual salary goal of $6.500 for registered nurses beginning their practice. it has been estimated that achieving such a goal would add approximately 85 cents to the daily costs per patient. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point the statement of the american nurses association in support of the resolution of a national salary goal for entrance into nursing.
there has been some question about amendments which may be coming over from the house of representatives to title xix of the social security act. dealing with the socalled medicaid program. a hotly controverted subject. i think it would be useful for any of us to k whether the majority leader is telling is. impliedly. that that is the end of that for this session. or whether he is .
. keeping our citizens on their feet and actively engaged in the mainstream of community life is one of the most important objectives of those in the health care professions. and it is to this fine purpose that the new york state podiatry societycurrently celebrating its 70th anniversaryis dedicated. the podiatry society was established in 1896 by a special act of the new york state legislature. over the years. the organization has grown both in size and stature and today has a membership of more than 1.000 throughout the state. podiatry. the science of diaging and treating diseases. injuries. and defects of the human foot. has made eworthy contributions to the health care of our people. indeed. the members of the new york state podiatry society have personified the professions pioneering and continuing efforts in the development of new and improved techniques in the treatment of foot disabilities. the podiatrist brings his skills and education to bear in a number of situations involving diagis and treatment. ranging from xrays -to surgery. the vital role played by the podiatrist comes into sharp focus when we recognize that approximately 130 million americans have suffered. at one time or aher. from some form of foot ailment. moreover. foot ills have cost industry in our nation hundreds of millions of dollars a year. mindful of their mounting responsibilities to the community. the members of the new york state podiatry society have provided commendable leadership in advancing programs that seek to assure optimum efficiency in industry. the societys public service programs are designed to stress the need for close attention to foot care early in life as well as for its efforts to assure the aged of good foot health. and podiatrists throughout the state devote many hours to clinics in hospitals and homes for the aged. in their clinic work. podiatrists have a dual objective. one. of course. is to provide periodic examinations for clinic visitors. the second is to closely observe patients who are bedridden and. wherever possible. to suggest rehabilitation programs that will help these patients get back on their feet. while the condition of a patients feet is of primary importance to the podiatrist. he also is deeply concerned with overall physical health. and consequently works closely with others in medicine to give new yorkers quality and comprehensive health care. podiatrists take a keen interest in overall health because physical ailments that affect the entire body often appear first as foot problems. when. in his examination. a podiatrist detects an incipient disease that requires medical attention. he refers the patient to the appropriate specialist. foot care. like general medical and dental care. is vital to modern living. and as the new york podiatry society marks this important milestone in its history. i join with my colleagues whose names are appended in congratulating this organization and its able and dedicated membership. i ask unanimous consent that a list of their names may be printed at this point in the record.
 to proclaim alcoholism information week. secretary of health. education. and welfare arthur fleming was the first postwar cabinet officer to demonstrate significant interest in the problems of alcoholism. it was he who cautioned the nation that "alcoholism is the fourth most serious health problem" facing us. and. in 1964. the republican platform specifically asked for increased financial support for combating alcoholism.
. the brightness of the opening day of the 90th congress has been considerably darkened for the nation and for his colleagues in congress by the sudden demise of representative john e. fogarty of rhode island. those of ussuch as myself---who were privileged to have served with him in the house of representatives are particularly saddened. for we had the opportunity to appreciate at firsthand the integrity. wisdom. and devotion to principle with which he pursued his congressional career. john fogarty. a member of the house since 1940. never forgot his early years as a bricklayer. remaining throughout his congressional career sensitive to the needs of those of modest means. he is particularly ed for being in the forefront of the battles for programs to benefit the health of the people of this nation. representative fogarty will be deeply mourned by his colleagues in this and the other body. and he will be sorely missed by the nation.
ial commission "to review all federal programs for the construction. expansion. and modernization of health and medical facilities and to advise hin on the future direction and scope of such programs and their potential role in moderating the rising trend in the cost of medical care."
. i ask unanimous consent that there be included as a part of my remarks at this point the full text of the recommendations for a federal council of health by the task force on federal medical services of the commission on organization of the executive branch of the governmentthe hoover commission.
. on behalf of myself and my colleague. senator robert f. kennedy. i send to to the desk a bill to amend the public health service act. the bill will specifically aid the new york state department of health in remedying a situation which i believe was unintended by congress. i ask unanimous consent that a letter from dr. hollis ingraham. new york commissioner of health. to congressman emanuel celler. chairman of the new york state congressional steering committee. which details the purpose and necessity for this bill. be printed at this point in the record.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. the alcoholism care and control act of 1967 for myself. the senator from utah [mr. moss]. and mr. bayh. mr. bible. mr. brooke. mr. burdick. mr. can. mr. church. mr. clark. mr. cooper. mr. dodd. mr. ervin.
 in vietnam as recently as n today. but i do  believe we are in any position where we have to have millions of americans convinced that their urgent needs are going to be unsupplied because we are fighting a struggle in vietnam. we k very well that we can afford to do what needs to be done on both fronts as the senator from pennsylvania has pointed out. what is required is $137.500.000. we can certainly find that amount of money for a matter as necessary and as urgent. in terms of the elementary public order. as this. i can testify to congress that if we do  want real trouble this summer. we absolutely must have money for summer programs. and we do  have it. the best prescription of the office of ecoic opportunity is to take funds from programs which exist  to finance summer programs. but that is just robbing peter to pay paul. it will do good. because you create as many difficulties as you cure. hing less than new money will do it. as the senator from pennsylvania has already saidand i do  wish to be redundantthe funding which we gave last summer of $20 million to 28 cities did  include some of the hottest spots we have today. and he named themjacksonville. nashville. louisville. and other cities. in the city of new york. as an elementary matter. there needs to be an expansion of the neighborhood youth corps. which- provides employment for teenagers. and yet. this summer the labor department has contracted for only 177.000 slots. nationwide. as opposed to 209.000 last year. i believe it would be really shameful to turn loose that many teenagers. with the explosive potentials which i see in my own city and which are present. according to the investigation of the committee chaired by the senator from pennsylvania. in so many other cities. the most shortsighted kind of judgment. in my opinion. would be to fail to supply some money for these summer programs. the $137.500.000 is a reasonable figure. i believe we should have it. i agree thoroughly with the senator from pennsylvania that there is use thinking about alternatives until we see whether congress really intends to deal justly with the poor of the united states. lest it be thought that the only ox being gored is that of the big citiesthough that is bad egh. with 70 percent of the population in these cities. and the possibility of disorder high unless the necessary programs are implemented with money. i should like to point to the fact that there is actual hungerindeed. starvationin a number of states. our committee personally investigated conditions in mississippi. and we came back convinced that there was actual hunger and deprivation among a very large number of people there. we reported that to the administration. we urged the administration to take measures to deal with that hunger. and we pointed out precisely how it could be dealt with. we have been turned down by the office of ecoic opportunity. according to a story which appears today in the new york times. based on a statement by my colleague. the senator from pennsylvania . i ask unanimous consent that this news report. headed "food aid barred for mississippi." be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. the hospital modernization and improvement act of 1967. a companion measure is being introduced today in the house of representatives by the dean of the new york state congressional delegation.
one. to comment on the statement. which i also regard of great importance. of the distinguished senator from georgia. i have way of judging as to the facts or details any more than does the senator from oregon. we must assume the gover is using his best judgment in the interest of the people of his state. but i would like to point out the number which are involved and therefore the other aspect of this problem which is so important. in the city of new york. for example. there are 1 million negroes and 750.000 of puerto rican extraction. in detroit. and like the senator from georgia. i must guess at the figures. there are probably several hundred thousand negroes involved in that area. it is a big area. crisscrossing the whole center of detroit. when we get into a situation of that size. in a highly congested center of such critical importance to this country. containing companies like general motors. ford. chrysler. and the critical defense obligations which are involvedagain. i do  k the detailsi could well understand that. even if the guard were big and well organizedas it is in michigan. i am sure. and in other statesto perform its duty. federal troops might still be required in order to supplement the guard. the reason why i make the observation is that i think i k something of the anatomy of this situation. it was by mere happenstance that on friday. with the distinguished chairman who presently occupies the chair . we had a hearing on the socalled bilingual education bill. which affects what we call spanish harlem. east harlem. where we had a problem over the weekend. fortunately for us. it was  quite as serious as in detroit. on saturday. in pursuance of a mal schedule. i spent a great part of the day in central harlem. the negro area. these are familiar places to me. it was a happenstance that these things happened. i point out that there are hundreds of thousands of people. in the middle of a hot summerand it is hotwho are depressed and frustrated. with a rate of unemployment as high as 25 percent. one of the most unbelievable sights as we go through the ghettos is that we always see ablebodied younger men and older men standing on the street corners with hing to do. and intolerable conditions in which to do hing. with emous welfare and relief rolls. and living in conditions which are most pitiful. even with the best of intentions to relieve them. there are stories of tenements with windows smashed. with vandalism taking place within a few hours after they are vacated for payment of rent when i say massive. i respectfully submit that it is true that we may  be able to do too much for what is happening today or what will happen tomorrow. the senator from georgia was very helpful to us in getting some summer money. which we had the foresight to get. we do  k how big a thing this can be compared with what it is. it has done us much good in new york and in other cities. i am grateful to him. because he is an important member of the appropriations committee. of which i am  a member. which has dealt with that problem. but we are dealing with massive problems. with all respect. while we have to do what we are doingand i am in support of the senator from oregon and anyone else who says we can tolerate disorder matter how big the grievances may be. and the disorders must be put down with condign strengthwe must remember that there is a need to take appropriate action in the banking and currency committees and other committees. for example on rat control. on the intercession of private business. which comes about seemingly in many cases when a riot has taken place and has stopped. i call attention to what happened in buffalo in my own state. these are endemic problems which will produce riots next summer. this summer we must live with them and do what must be done. somehow we will surmount them. so i urge my colleagues. when they consider legislation such as aid to dependent children. day care. elementary and secondary education. to remember we are making or condoning the conditions which breed the social cancer that we have in our midst at one and the same time we deal with these measures. so i ask my colleagues  to look down their es when they have before them legislation dealing with demonstration cities or slum clearance. they deal with conditions that riots are made of. they may  be able to do something because of their consciences or principles or as representing the people they represent. but they must remember that it is this kind of action which makes or unmakes solutions to these problems.
secondly. again. the words "with respect to" give rise to a possible implication that it oculd affect any generic programfor example. a hospital or aher institutionwhere that particular individual may be seeking more of the benefit of this act and may. by some happenstance. receive it. it is understood. therefore. that the amendment applies only to that individual and to any service. payment. or assistance to that individual.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at its next printing. the name of the senator from illis be added as a cosponsor of the bill to amend the public health service act to provide special assistance for the improvement of laboratory animal research facilities. to establish standards for the humane care. handling. and treatment of laboratory animals in departments. agencies. and instrumentalities of the united states and by recipients of grants. awards. and contracts from the united states. to encourage the study and improvement of the care. handling. and treatment and the development of methods for minimizing pain and discomfort of laboratory animals used in biomedical activities. and to otherwise assure humane care. handling. and treatment of laboratory animals. and for other purposes.
. i point out that the bill i have introduced has the support of the humane society and the doctors organization which deals with experimentation of this character. which is so very important to health. to the future health. and to the care and cure of disease in our country. the fundamental idea is to try to reconcile the views of all concerned consistent with the traditional humane outlook of our country toward animals. i joined in the enactment of one bill which took the animal care to preexperimentation stages. this is an effort to extend that measure to the experimental stage. i hope that common ground may be found between the two views. i am  opinionated about the matter. but i believe in reply to the senator from oklahoma this information should be available to show the other side of the case. exhnrr 1
. all of these farmer cooperatives in new york do an annual gross business of some $1 billion. many other types of cooperatives contribute to the general wellbeing of many citizens of new york. these include cooperatives for housing. credit. health plans. and consumers. this is  in derogation of the great enterprise system and its profitmaking activities. in which i believe. and which i have sought to implement in many ways in the senate.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at its next printing. the name of the senator from new york and the senator from oregon be added as cosponsors of the bill to amend the social security act to permit an individual to become entitled to hospital insurance benefits under title xviii of such act. if he is otherwise qualified therefor. without filing application for benefits under title ii of such act.
. on october 19. 1967. an error was made in a unanimousconsent request for the record in which the senator from new york and the senator from oregon were added as cosponsors of s. 2467. i ask unanimous consent that the consent be withdrawn and that. at its next printing. their names be added as cosponsors of s. 2463 to amend the social security amendments of 1965 so as to eliminate therefrom certain provisions which deny hospital insurance benefits to certain individuals otherwise eligible therefor because of their membership in certain subversive organizations or their prior conviction of crimes involving subversive activities. and for other purposes.
i am the ranking miity member of the subcommittee on this particular appropriation. i have been in many conferences with the other body. i never saw a more difficult one than this. it was deadlocked for weeks on end. due to many provisions in the measure adopted by the senate and the house. including this one. to which my colleagues from maryland and wisconsin have addressed themselves. this deadlock was broken only by an emous range of compromises effected through the extraordinary leadership. tact. and wisdom of the senator from alabama. the chairman of the senate conferees. this particular laboratory proved to be a major sticking point. concerning which we spent literally hours of debate and discussion. the issue never was resolved in any manner until finally we found that the government agencies involved. which are so important to the health of the nation. were suffering. and we just had to conclude. almost summarily from the point where we were. with the remaining issues which had been unresolved. resolved the best way we could at that given moment. but this was the end point.  the beginning. of a long series of compromises on many issues. we tried to compromise in several ways on this issue. but both positions proved to be inflexible. i can testify to the devotion and the steadfastness with which the senator from alabama led the senate conferees in standing by the senate position. i wish that we could have come to a more equitable conclusion. which would have barred part of the country.  even within 50 miles of the capitol. but it was absolutely impossible. i join with senator hill in pointing out that even in the state of maryland there are plenty of places that are more than 50 miles from the capitol. so that state is  barred from participation. there is state completely encompassed within 50 miles of the capitol except the district of columbia. i considered it to be our duty as members of the appropriations subcommittee dealing with this matter to see that everybody has a fair crack at what is finally done. and that it should  be taken for granted. though of course wisconsin has a completely legitimate right to contend with might and main for it. that it will necessarily go to wisconsin. so i join my chairman in his statements with respect to this particular matter. which was so vexing to us. and was one of the last items on which action was concluded with respect to this conference report.
the bill i introduced is s. 2076. does the senator  believe that all we really have to do is to get buyers of bonds to believe that the obligor is suable. one wants to sue a hospital. although its credit is excellent. even though the u.s. government guarantees this matter. the government will never have to pay the judgment. because the hospital can raise the money.
i am very grateful to the senator. i hope that we can do the job on this legislation that is really terribly urgent. i had a friend the other day who was involved in an automobile accident and i had occasion to go to one of our midtown hospitals to see him. that hospital is strictly a 19thcentury institution. it is unbelievable that such conditions could exist in the 20th century. the conditions existing in the hospital are such that it looks just as it did 100 years ago. this results. of course. because of the lack of money. modernization can be effected unless we have federal assistance in this regard.
. recently. the american association for cancer research hoed the senior senator from alabama as the recipient of a certificate of award from this organization. senator hill. who has served on the committee on labor and public welfare for over 20 years. was first appointed to the committee in january of 1947. and has been its able chairman since 1955. the record of the labor and public welfare committee during these two decades is ample evidence of his accomplishments. during my tenure as a member of senator hills committee. i have worked closely with this distinguished senator and have always had the deepest respect and admiration for his sense of fairness. good judgment. and dedication. the award praises senator hill and his efforts on behalf of american medicine and. especially. the american people. i quote from the citation: his leadership in the senate has helped to create a revolution in the support of medical research and has accelerated the pace of progress in cancer research. legislation he has fostered has brought the modern hospital and the benefits of medical research increasingly within the reach of the aged. the indigent. and those in rural communities. his contributions to health extend beyond the confines of the united states. ramifying into every corner of the world . . . the american association for cancer research is proud to ho this scholarly historian and statesman of medicine and of medical science by bestowing. with deep respect. this certificate of award. i ask unanimous consent that the full citation be printed in the record and extend my congratulations to senator hill on this ho.
one more word. i should like to point out that the ranking miity member of the education subcommittee is the senator from vermont [mr. paouty]. unhappily. he can be with us today. because of a momentary health problem. i want to speak most feelingly about him. i am a member of the education subcommittee. too. as well as the senator from colorado and the senator from california . who are in the chamber. and who have been extremely active in its work as members of the subcommittee. however. i think we would all be derelict in our duty if we did  speak in glowing terms of the leadership of the senator from vermont . who is. unfortunately. unable to be with us today. he has done much creative and outstanding work on the subcommittee.
i just wanted to e that the senator from vermont is the ranking miity member of the employment and manpower subcommittee. which handled this bill. he gave it indefatigable attention. faithfully attended the hearings in the field. came to as much of the conference as he could. probably more than he should. and then had to go to the hospital for a checkup. and i think his name must be mentioned most favorably and graciously in this connection.
. i submit a resolution that would result in the building of a battle monument and the issuance of a commemorative stamp hoing the "lost battalion" of world war i. the september to ember 1918 meuseargonne campaign constituted the greatest battle in american history up to that time. more than 1.200.000 americans took part in this 47day campaign along a front that extended from southeast of verdun at the argonne forest. out of this battle action emerged the legend of the "lost battalion." for 5 days. a valiant detachment of american soldiers. under constant enemy fire and lacking food. water. and medical supplies. held fast even though completely surrounded by german forces. on october 2. 1918. maj. gen. robert alexander. commander of the 77th division. ordered the understrength 1st and 2d battalions of 308th infantry regiment to the attack. maj. charles whittlesey. commanding the 1st battalion. led the assault. the offensive of which this attack was a part failed everywhere. but major whittlesey and his men reached a ravine just south of their objective. thus began the legend of the "lost battalion." cut off from the other u.s. forcessewed up in a pocket approximately 300 yards long and 60 yards widemajor whittleseys men dug into the thickets of the argonne forest to secure their positions. attempts made to reach the "lost battalion" were repulsed by the germans. by october 5. major whittlesey and his men were suffering severely. having been isolated for 3 nights and lacking sufficient food. water. and medical supplies. and they were surrounded by a fresh german division. the mortars. machineguns. flamethrowers. and rifles of which lashed at them relentlessly. on october 7. major whittlesey received a surrender message from his german counterpart. he sent reply. the germans launched a fierce attack with flamethrowers. and were repulsed. paralleling this action. a major american attack was launched. and the "lost battalion" was reached. the "lost battalion." in reality. consisted of the 1st battalion of the 308th regiment and elements of the 307th and the 306th machinegun company. it would have been lost to the enemy. save for the heroism and tenacity of the american fighting men involved. published figures vary. but of the 550 men sealed off in the pocket. one source lists 252 survivors. 107 dead. 190 wounded. and 63 missing. major whittlesey. captain mcmurty. and captain holderman each received the congressional medal of ho and the survivors of the "lost battalion" volunteered to remain on the frontline. the deeds of the men of the "lost battalion" constitute a legend and a symbol. equaling such other moments in american history as the alamo. when americans have done that which has been necessary regardless of the cost to themselves. it is only fitting. therefore. that the nation should ho the men of the "lost battalion" in like manner. a conspicuous monument has never been erected for this purpose. so. on behalf of senator kennedy of new york and myself. because this was a unit of the 77th division. one of new yorks own. i submit this resolution for appropriate reference.
. at my request. the legislative reference service of the library of congress prepared a study on medical experimentation on human beings. with my permission. this material served as the basis for the michigan society of pathologists carl v. weller lecture on "volunteer participation in clinical investigation." delivered by dr. frank w. hartman. medical research adviser. office of the surgeon general. u.s. air force. and dr. freeman h. quimby. specialist in science and techogy. science policy research division of the library of congress. with the expansion of scientific research to the point where more than $2 billion of medical research alone is conducted annually in this nation. it is most important that every possible care be exercised to protect the rights of the individual who. as a subject. might be involved. i ask unanimous consent that the lecture. which contains the essentials of the library of congress study. to which i have referred. be printed at this point in the record.
. in considering health manpower legislation we are. in effect. dealing with the two principal health problems facing the nation--delivery of health care and rapidly rising health costs. our nation is short 50.000 doctors. 5.000 u.s. communities are without any physicians and the number is rising. as to the shortage of nurses. the report of the new york state joint legislative committee on the problems of public health and medicare. the lent report. states that the "single most important health problem in new york state and the nation is how to increase the number of professional registered nurses." health manpower relates directly to the price of medical care. personnel costs. for example. comprise 70 percent of hospital operating expenses. and hospital fees are rising twice as fast as the cost of living.  only do we have a responsibility to meet growing health manpower demands in the almost 200 health occupations but the nation also has a responsibility to modernize health care at all levels. this would include. for instance. a reexamination of medical education which has  undergone an extensive revamping for almost two generations. already progress is being made in this direction as some medical schools are cutting down on the lengthy course of study and redesigning curriculum. we must also apply ourselves to cutting down the wasteful high dropout rate of medical studentsrunning more than 10 percentwho leave in midcourse. and we must sustain our medical schools so that the thousands of qualified young people who are discouraged from undertaking a medical education because of lack of funds or lack of facilities might be able to pursue a medical career. the bill before us goes far to meet these needs. i submit these amendments to better achieve these very needs.
. i submit an amendment to s. 2864. the occupational health and safety bill. the amendment would provide for the establishment of a broadly based commission to make a comprehensive study and evaluation of our workmens compensation laws. i ask that the amendment be appropriately referred and that its text be printed in the record.
. with the resignation early this week of food and drug commissioner james l. goddard. the administration faces the responsibility of appointing a successor who is. in the words of the new york times editorial of may 23. an individual of "great energy. substantial professional status. and considerable courage." the food and drug administration is one of the most important consumer agencies in the federal governmentas a matter of fact. 25 cents of every consumer dollar is spent for products produced by fdaregulated industries. thus. it is incumbent upon the administration to designate an able. consumerminded executive to this post which commissioner goddard has called "one of the hottest of the governmental hotspots." . a final point. it is  generally recognized that the food and drug commissioner is  an "advise and consent" post. although other officials at the same echelon in the department of health. education. and welfare arefor example. the commissioner of education. and the surgeon general. senate confirmation of the ination of the fda commissioner would afford the senate an opportunity to review the qualifications of the appointee and determine the policies he will be pursuing as commissioner. this is  done by the required senate confirmation of the inations of the assistant secretaries of health. education. and welfare. the commissioner of social security. the commissioner on aging. and others who occupy parallel positions within the department. it is for this reason that i introduced s. 958 on february 15. 1967. this bill would mandate such senatorial advice and consent. while it may have been appropriate for a commissioner of food and drugs to have been appointed without a senate review when the food and drug act first went into effect in 1907 or when the fda was created in its present form in 1930. the scope of the agencys responsibilities for the publics health have grown so appreciably since that time that the opportunity for senate advice and consent should  be afforded. the task involved in selecting a successor to dr. goddard gives emphasis to this point.
. i hope that this bill will receive serious consideration. it can be a crucial factor in making the medicaid program truly available to those who fall within its provisions and need its services by eliminating an important obstacle.
while i first proposed this measure as an amendment to the occupational health and safety bill. i reintroduce it today as a separate measure at the suggestion of secretary of labor w. willard wirtz and senator yarborough. the chairman of the senate labor subcommittee. who is the principal sponsor of the occupational health and safety bill. while there is a relationship between workmens compensation and occupational health and safety. the two being the opposite sides of a single coin. there is egh of a distinction in the issues presented to warrant treating them independently. i shall. accordingly.  press the proposal as an amendment to the occupational health and safety bill. however. i do intend to press for its early consideration and adoption as a separate bill. i ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from willard wirtz. the secretary of labor. dated july 9. 1968. be printed in the record.
. one of the greatest manpower needs in health is apparent in the dire shortage of nurses. in new york city. for example. some hospitals are able to fill only half of all nursing posts. nurses are a vital factor in the health manpower team. and the availability and quality of nursing care is most important if our people are to receive highquality health services. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an article entitled "more or better nursing education." published in the washington evening star of july 19. the article refers to this need and to the means to meet the challenge posed by it.
. we face a very difficult situation here. i do . in any way. take issue with those who may differ with me on the questions which involve the medicaid program in many states. including my own of new york. we face a very difficult situation in my state. and we think some 22 other states and the district of columbia. which is attributable to an amendment which was offered here by the senator from louisiana and was adopted by the senate on a rollcall when i was  here. that is hing against it because i was  here. that is my problemand that of other senators who have a very deep interest. who were  here. as this bill still remains before us. it seems to me that we have a right to try to deal with the problem in some way which meets our concern. just as the mover had an absolute right to proceed as. he did. i am  pleading surprise or anything else. it is true we did  k about it. but the senator was  obliged to tell us about it. i hope the senator from louisiana will understand that there is hing in what i say which reflects upon his proceeding in the way his conscience dictates. but for us it presents an emous problem. it is my duty. as a senator from new york. and i think it will be the duty of other senators who are similarly involved. to do what we can about it. so i hope the senator. as i have set the framework for what we are going to say and do. will understand that is why i have made it crystal clear. there is quarrel with his duty if -his conscience dictates that he shall proceed in a certain way.
i thank the senator. of course. i can understand his point of view. the real problem. . there are a good many facts and figures which can be produced about this situation. but i think that the best way in which it can be put before the senate is by an amendment to the pending bill. which will endeavor. to some extent. to deal with the states which have installed important medicaid programs. and. at the conclusion of my remarks. when i do conclude today. i expect to send to the desk an amendment. for myself and other senators. which will endeavor to deal with some of these very grave problems which i wish to raise in respect to this matter.
. the issue is that we did have 69 senators present in respect of the vote to which the senator refers. the difference between the two votes was 19. the vote was 44 to 25. there are 31 other members of the senate. so. i do  think we can assume that we are precluded finally by what the senate might want to do. the senator points out that the senate did accept an exemption of commodity credit corporation expenditures. but did  accept an exemption of medicaid expenditures. that poses a problem that we face here time and again. we always seem to be fighting up that slippery hill. although the rural population of the country is  something like 16 percent or 17 percent. and the city population is something like 70 percent and growing all of the time. when we get down to city issues. some senators get very ecoical. but when we get to a rural issue. these same senators get very liberal. the city fellows for years have gone along with the idea of trying to work with the agricultural people. even though we begin to see some pretty nefarious practices in respect to large recipients of commodity credit payments. but here we are again: the commodity credit expenditures. socalled involuntary expenditures. are very neatly exempted. apparently. the only way to deal with medicaid is  to exempt it but to cut it. and i believe it is our duty. therefore. to fight against it. to demonstrate that if they are going to be equated in any way. we. too. like the commodity credit situation. deserve very serious consideration by congress.
let me say that my colleague [. they will want to take aher "think" on the medicaid program. or on the ccc programand i am sure. incidentally. they will too. i do  think there is anything in holy writ that says it has got to go on just as it is. or anything else. all we say is that at this particular time. at the end of a congress. when we come in with so drastic a change in fundamental financial conditions which affect great populations. we think it possible that the senate did  fully grasp the extent and the consequences of its actions. we are developing them  and we are going to continue to develop them and will do our best to present to the senate a more balanced picture of the issues on which the senate may then vote
. i consider the medicaid approach a very intelligent answer to the situation. but by means a final approach. i think that all we are doing is holding the line in respect to the health of our people. having given a certain sense of social stability so that people who do  have the meansbut see the emous advance and progress of medical sciencedo  feel that the great effort and great concept of enabling a person to have a longer lifespan is exclusively the province of those who can afford it. we are endeavoring in a governmental sense to open the door to a longer lifespan for the poor as well as for others who can afford it.
. the medicaid program is really an effort to develop for people who could  afford it otherwise an equivalency of medical care. we had very much the same problem in respect of medicare with respect to our older people. i think we have taken a reasonable disposition of it. i take great pride in the fact that there is in the medicare program a voluntary aspect which gives an older person an opportunity to get the services of a physician for a very reasonable expenditure. as well as hospitalization which medicare affords them. i think that is very desirable. this is a progressive concept. i for one have always been very much committed to getting the private system of the united states to share in a very important part of this responsibility. in will be remembered that when medi.are was being considered. a number of is had some very important aspects of .he bill to debate. together with the benator from new mexico . i worked very hard and long on the matter of bringing the insurance system of the united states into what is  a voluntary part of the act. i regret very much. and always will regret. that the insurance system of the united states did  take advantage of that opportunity. i have  given up hope. however. that they may. i think that one day they will realize the emous field for both public and private service which exists in that sphere and that we will come to a dayand perhaps i may  be here at the timewhen through the efforts of the private and public sectors. more extensive services. including drugs and medicineof which we have heard much concerning the excessive cost in many areaswill be made available to our older citizens. i feel the same way about medicaid. i think we are making a great forward advance in respect of our nation. i think this forward advance will be very materially improved by a major system of compulsory health insurance for employees paid for by the individual. but also. if necessary. by individual states as elements of employment. it is interesting that medicaid recipients are very heavily employed. we are  dealing with unemployed people. many people make wages that are below par in terms of ability to meet medical costs. therefore we have the idea of insurance which would give the actuarial benefit of coverage to millions of workers rather than the very limited actuarial benefit of coverage of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. if individual insurance companies can work it out. it may become a real alternative to the problem of medicaid costs. however. because we think it very socially desirable today. we wish to afford benefits immediately to a person who may ultimately be receiving the benefit of that kind of insurance. the gover of the state of new york. gover rockefeller. has already recommended that as a major state matter we may get this measure passed into law in our next legislature. in 1969. i shall certainly try for it. and i hope it will happen.
. i rise to submit a resolution that would result in the creation of a battle monument. hoing the "lost battalion" of world war i. the septemberember 1918 meuseargonne campaign constituted the greatest battle in american history up to that time. more than 1.200.000 americans took part in this 47day campaign along a front that extended from southeast of verdun at the argonne forest. out of this battle action emerged the legend of the "lost battalion." for 5 days. a valiant detachment of american soldiers. under constant enemy fire and lacking food. water and medical supplies. held fast even though completely surrounded by german forces. on october 2. 1918. maj. gen. robert alexander. commander of the 77th division. ordered the understrength 1st and 2d battalions of 308th infantry regiment to the attack. maj. charles wittlesey. commanding the 1st battalion. led the assault. the offensive of which this attack was a part failed everywhere. but major wittlesey and his men reached a ravine just south of their objective. thus began the legend of the "lost battalion." cut off from the other u.s. forcessewed up in a pocket approximately 300 yards long and 60 yards widemajor wittleseys men dug into the thickets of the argonne forest to secure their positions. attempts made to reach the "lost battalion" were repulsed by the germans. by october 5. major wittlesey and his men were suffering severely. having been isolated for 3 nights and lacking sufficient food. water and medical supplies. and they were surrounded by a fresh german division. the mortars. machineguns. flamethrowers and rifles of which lashed at them relentlessly. on october 7. major wittlesey received a surrender message from his german counterpart. he sent reply. the germans launched a fierce attack with flamethrowers. and were repulsed. paralleling this action. a major american attack was launched. and the "lost battalion" was reached. the "lost battalion." in reality. consisted of the 1st battalion of the 308th regiment and elements of the 307th and the 306th machinegun company. it would have been lost to the enemy. save for the heroism and tenacity of the american fighting men involved. published figures vary. but of the 550 men sealed off in the pocket. one source lists 252 survivors. 107 dead. 190 wounded. and 63 missing. major wittlesey. captain mcmurty. and captain holderman each received the congressional medal of ho and the survivors of the "lost battalion" volunteered to remain on the frontline. the deeds of the men of the "lost battalion" constitute a legend and a symbol. equaling such other moments in american history as the alamo. when americans have done that which has been necessary regardless of the cost to themselves. it is only fitting. therefore. that the nation should ho the men of the "lost battalion" in like manner.
. i can think of hing which would gladden the heart of senator hill more than a report of this kind of achievement. many of us have felt. for example. in the cancer field. that if only the people who fell victim to cancer lived 15 years from  or perhaps even less. they would never have died. any more than the pneumonia patient or the patient with lung diseasestuberculosis. and so forthas was true 25 or 30 years ago. need consider that a death sentence. so in our personal relations. which have been tremendously gratifying. friendly. cooperative. and most accommodating. and in the high professional standing which senator hill has attained in this body. and in the tremendous benefaction which he represents to the medical science of our countryparticularly to medical sciencei rise to pay tribute to my colleague and friend. and to bespeak for him and for his wife and family many continued years of happiness and fruitful enjoyment which he has so richly earned. and the enhancement of the quality of their name. for which he has been so magnificently responsible.
. i should like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an article published in the new york times which describes the tremendous contribution made by dr. robert a. hingson to world health. dr. hingson is the ingenious man who invented a "gun for peace." a jet injector which is a gunlike device that will administer to people throughout the world iulations against epidemic diseases. by helping to prevent diseases which ravage men both physically and mentally. dr. hingson has made a historic contribution to world peace and wellbeing. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the article entitled. "peace gun kills iulation pains." published in the new york times on
. i ask unanimous consent that there be included as a part of my remarks at this point the full text of the recommendations for a federal council of health by the task force on federal medical services of the commission on organization of the executive branch of the governmentthe hoover commission.
. i rise to submit a resolution that would result in the creation of a battle monument. hoing the "lost battalion" of world war i. the september to ember 1918 meuseargonne campaign constituted the greatest battle in american history up to that time. more than 1.200.000 americans took part in this 47day campaign along a front that extended from southeast of verdun at the argonne forest. out of this battle action emerged the legend of the "lost battalion." for 5 days. a valiant detachment of american soldiers. under constant enemy fire and lacking food. water. and medical supplies. held fast even though completely surrounded by german forces. on october 2. 1918. maj. gen. robert alexander. commander of the 77th division. ordered the understrength 1st and 2d battalions of the 308th infantry regiment to the attack. maj. charles wittlesey. commanding the 1st battalion. led the assault. the offensive. of which this attack was a part. failed everywhere. but major whittlesey and his men reached a ravine just south of their objective. thus began the legend of the "lost battalion." cut off from the other u.s. forces--sewed up in a pocket approximately 300 yards long and 60 yards widemajor whittleseys men dug into the thickets of the argonne forest to secure their positions. attempts made to reach the "lost battalion" were repulsed by the germans. by october 5. major whittlesey and his men were suffering severely. having been isolated for 3 nights and lacking sufficient food. water. and medical supplies. and they were surrounded by a fresh german division. the mortars. machineguns. flamethrowers. and rifles of which lashed at them relentlessly. on october 7. major whittlesey received a surrender message from his german counterpart. he sent reply. the germans launched a fierce attack with flamethrowers. and were repulsed. paralleling this action. a major american attack was launched. and the "lost battalion" was reached. the "lost battalion." in reality. consisted of the 1st battalion of the 308th regiment and elements of the 307th and the 306th machinegun company. it would have been lost to the enemy. save for the heroism and tenacity of the american fighting men involved. published figures vary. but of the 550 men sealed off in the pocket. one source lists 252 survivors. 107 dead. 190 wounded. and 63 missing. major whittlesey. captain mcmurty. and captain holderman each received the congressional medal of ho and the survivors of the "lost battalion" volunteered to remain on the front line. the deeds of the men of the "lost battalion" constitute a legend and a symbol. equaling such other moments in american history as the alamo. when americans have done that which has been necessary regardless of the cost to themselves. it is only fitting. therefore. that the nation should ho the men of the "lost battalion" in like manner. i request that this resolution be referred to the senate committee on interior and insular affairs for their consideration.
 from a broad spectrum of interests. including state workmens compensation boards. representatives of insurance carriers. business. labor. the members of the medical profession experienced in industrial medicine or workmens compensation. and educators having special expertise in the field of workmens compensation. as well as representatives of the general public. the secretaries of labor. commerce. and health. education. and welfare would be ex officio members. the commission would have 1 year to file its report.
. i introduce. for myself. mr. prouty. and mr. yarborough. for appropriate reference. a bill amending title vii of the public health service act to authorize direct student loans to students studying outside the united states at a school of medicine. podiatry. osteopathy. dentistry. or optometry approved by the secretary of health. education. and welfare. under the health professions education assistance act. american medical. podiatry. osteopathic. dental. and optometric students studying in the united states may obtain direct loans from hew of up to $2.500 annually. my bill would extend this to americans studying abroad. additional funding authorization is required. our nation is short some 50.000 doctors today. even with projected expansion of medical schools in the united states. the shortage will still be 42.000 in 1975 due to population increases and increased demand. some 11 percent of american medical students are  in foreign universities because there are  egh medical schools in this country. that a foreign medical education does meet u.s. standards is illustrated by the fact that some 1.600 foreigneducated foreign doctors are "imported" each year and the large number of foreigneducated interns and residents in u.s. hospitals. the gi bills of world war ii. korean war. and the cold war all extend benefits to eligible veterans studying abroad. thus. for over a generation the concept of aiding eligible american students attending a foreign school has been well established and operated successfully. it should be pointed out that the authority granted to the secretary of health. education. and welfare to approve courses of medical study abroad is  intended to establish any new precedent with respect to accreditation of institutions of higher education. this provision is necessary because of the unique nature of study in foreign institutions. and it is anticipated that in exercising this authority the secretary will consult with appropriate professional and accrediting groups within the united states. this measure is identical in language to the provision which passed the senate on june 24. 1968. as part of the health manpower act but was deleted in conference with the house.
. it is appropriate that the congress should pause in this month of march 1969. to express its congratulations to a great organization commemorating its golden anniversarythe american legionand adopt senate resolution 163. since the first meeting of the american legion. held in paris. france. 50 years ago this march 15. the legion has contributed through its various programs a great deal to the welfare of our nation. the american legion has achieved a magnificent record in its legislative activity and direct service to those men and their families who have sacrificed so much for our country. the legion has moved effectively in the congress to strengthen and extend veterans benefits programs---compensation and pension.. education and training. hospital and medical care. and vocational rehabilitation. as the legion looks ahead to 1969its 50th golden anniversary yeari am confident it will strive to seek to determine what further can be done to broaden and improve patriotism. service to the nation and to its veterans. the legions legislative accomplishments and personal service to veterans and their dependents serves as a living memorial to the sacrifice offered by those brave young americans who fell in battle at belleau wood. anzio. pork chop hill. and most recently on the bloody ground around khe sanh. to many other shrines to their valor. as a fellow legionnaire. as are more than half of the members of congress. i say with pride: congratulations to a great american institution. the american legion on its golden anniversary.
. i value. of course. whatever any senator may say about his own state. attempting to clarify the facts and determine the magnitude of the problem. however. i rise today in an effort to point out that whatever our experience may have been. it does  diminish our responsibility  the impact of the problem upon us. i have been in this very struggle for a long time as a member of the committee on labor and public welfare. i was involved in the matter before this phase began. there is movement. and there will have to be more. there is hing sacrosanct about food stamps. they may have to be given free to the poorest of the poor. because food stamps are a very effective way to get food distributed. we must all resolvewhether it is 2.700 migrants as the senator from florcxv461part 6 ida says. or 22.000 as we and the county officials saythat something must be done about it we actually saw women with children who had other means of subsistence except to go out on the farms and work. one woman told us that if she did  workand she. though unmarried. had several childrenshe did  k where. using her words. she "could have somebody help" her out even the doctor in the community who operated the local health clinicalthough he was only one man and had only one helpersaid that even by prescription he could  do very much. he felt that if any county should have had a case of starvation called to its attention that that county would find a way to relieve the situation. he said that collier county had allocated $7.500 of the budget for food assistance. if the figures are remotely correct2.700. let alone 22.000that is a very small and sorry figure. i have explained the philosophy involved. whatever the right figure may be. this situation should  exist in our country. we must undertake a solemn resolution to deal with the situation in whatever form we have to deal with it. whether by an amendment to the law dealing with food stamps and the distribution of food or money. or some other way. we will do whatever we must do. then the work of the committee will have been a blessing. the committee is limited. it must develop these facts all over the country.
. it is unlikely that we will meet all our health facility construction. modernization. or replacement needs over the next 3 years. but this legislation will go a long way toward that goal. we are committed to providing urgently needed health care to all our citizens and it is therefore vital that we  delay enactment of health legislation designed to achieve this goal in the most effective manner. for this reason. the bill i have introduced today would  await the expiration of the current hillburton authorization. but would become effective with the fiscal year commencing july 1. 1969. only with this type of redirected federal effort can we adequately meet our health commitment to the american people. i point out that the states have been encouraged to inate. but the localities have . we believe that the appropriations requested here are modesta total of $25 million over a period of the first 2 yearsand that this is an extremely desirable bill. i ask that a summary of the bill be printed in the record as part of my remarks.
. i introduce. for myself. the senator from utah (mr. moss). and 43 other senators from both parties. the alcoholism care and control act of 1969 to undertake a concerted drive against alcoholism. the nations fourth more serious health problem. this bill would: first. establish a division of alcoholism and alcohol problems within the national institute of mental health with broad responsibilities in areas of research. education. coordination. prevention. and support for community treatment and rehabilitation programs. second. provide incentive grants for the construction. staffing. and operation of facilities for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism in order to encourage the establishment of such programs. for this purpose for the next fiscal year. $15 million would be authorized. third. provide grants for alcohol education directed at the general public. schoolage children. and special highrisk groups. for the next fiscal year $200.000 is authorized for this purpose. fourth. provide special purpose grants for the development of specialized training programs or materials for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. research relating to current and project personnel nfds in the field of alcoholism. surveys to evaluate the adequacy of programs for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. and field trials and demonstration programs for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. such as detoxification programs. courtsupervised programs for alcoholics and programs in correctional institutions and aftercare programs for alcoholics. there is $1.25 million authorized for the next fiscal year. fifth. provide fellowship grants to professional personnel for training in alcoholism and alcoholrelated problems in order to overcome critical shortages of trained people. there is a $200.000 authorization for the next fiscal year. sixth. establish regional centers for research in alcoholism and alcoholrelated problems in order to overcome the longstanding neglect in this field. for fiscal year 1970. $3 million is authorized. cosponsoring the bill with senator moss and myself are senators howard
. when i introduced for myself. for the senator from utah (mr. moss). and 43 other senators from both parties. the alcoholism care and control act of 1969s. 1997the department of health. education. and welfares required report on the administration of the allied health professions personnel training act of 1966 was  available for inclusion along with my remarks. in discussing manpower needs in relation to alcoholism. the report states: one of the most urgent needs in relation to coping more effectively with alcoholism is the overcoming of the acute shortage of trained personnel. i ask unanimous consent that appendix f. the text of the report relating to manpower needs in relation to alcoholism be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. although we have made great strides forwaird and come to recognize alcoholism as a health problem. we have far to go to meet the sociomedical challenge in the treatment of alcoholism. as a health problem. alcoholism is confronted with the acute shortage of health manpower common to all areas of health care. the report reaffirms the urgent need for qualified personnel to provide treatment in the field of alcoholismthe nations fourth most serious health problem. and i consider it an endorsement of the proposed legislation. i believe the report makes quite clear that the alcoholic rehabilitation act should be implemented by an intensified program of manpower and staff training. including  only the recruiting and training of new personnel. but also the improvement of the skills of persons already in the field of alcoholism health carea specific purpose of the alcoholism care and control act through a provision which establishes fellowship grants to overcome the critical shortage of trained people in alcoholism and alcoholrelated problems.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at its next printing. the name of the senator from oregon be added as a cosponsor of the bill to amend the public health service act to provide special assistance for the improvement of laboratory animal research facilities. to establish further standards for the humane care. handling. and treatment of laboratory animals in departments. agencies. and instrumentalities of the united states and by recipients of grants. awards. and contracts from the united states. to encourage the study and improvement of the care. handling. and treatment with the development of methods of minimizing pain and discomfort of laboratory animals used in biomedical activities. and to otherwise assure humane care. handling. and treatment of laboratory animals. and for other purposes.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at the next printing. the name of the senator from massachusetts be added as a cosponsor of s. 2482 to amend the public health service act so as to add to such act a new title dealing especially with kidney disease and kidneyrelated diseases.
i respect that. i respect the fact that the chair is presenting his case in a certain way in which he feels it is best presented. i personally would have opposed it. i had hoped that we could have called the members of this commission to testify much sooner than we  apparently will be. i made that clear to the chair. but as i said a minute ago. i hope we may continue to discuss this issue of campus disorder on a high level. -i would ask the chairman. under the circumstances. to consider calling these officials of the commission once more. i think it will really help the hearings.
 and the congress by the department of health. education. and welfare on the allied health professions personnel training act of 1966. as amended. has revealed the grave deficiencies in allied health personnel. the need to experiment in the areas of education and health manpower utilization. and the serious shortfall of resources which are being made available to meet current health personnel needs. the requirement for this report resulted from my questions during the senate health subcommittee hearings on the critical shortage of health manpower. i have written to secretary finch expressing my deep concern about the findings of this report. he has. in turn. advised me thatstrenuous efforts need to be made to tap every potential resource to augment the pool of personnel needed to provide adequate health services to all our people. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of our correspondence be placed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
i am convinced that we must improve the allied health professions personnel training act of 1966. as amended. by initiating new programs. providing new funds. and establishing new incentives. we must increase the nations supply of manpower in the allied health fields by utilizing in our civilianhealth industry the more than 30.000 medical corpsmen who leave the military service each year. what better way to help many of the thousands of returning vietnam veterans find meaningful employment. surely. a medical corpsman who is qualified to treat the wounded on the battlefield should be quickly qualified to assist in the treatment of patients in our hospitals wards and emergency rooms. a recent issue of the national academy of sciences news report indicates that relatively few of these veterans decide on a career in civilian health services because of traditions and restrictive requirements which block their entry into jobs commensurate with their abilities. they are forced to take menial tasks until they have the proper civilian credentials and training for skills they already have acquired and used in the service. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the article entitled "make use of corpsmen from military as medical aids in united states. report says." from the junejuly 1969 issue of the national academy of sciences news report be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
to add to this problem. current federal assistance for those seeking training toward a career in the allied health professions--the excorpsmen and the students alikeis directed only to those who are pursuing degreeoriented programs in training centers for the allied health professions. this degree requirement tends to accentuate the already topheavy manpower structure in the health field and stresses degree attainment rather than the offering of services to the patient. moreover. many times the requirement of .. degree results in extending a training program substantially beyond that which is actually necessary for proficiency in a particular healthtechogy field. the bill i am introducing today wouldfirst. provide specialproject grants to plan. develop. or establish new programs. or modify existing programs. for training or retraining of health personnel. this section would include incentives to utilize veterans with experience in the health fields. for this purpose $15 million is authorized to be appropriated for the first fiscal year. second. provide grants to identify and recruit into education and training for the alliedhealth professions. first. veterans with experience in the health field. and second. individuals of cultural. ecoic and educational deprivation who are potential candidates for the alliedhealth professions. for this purpose $750 thousand is authorized to be appropriated for the first fiscal year. third. provide scholarship grants and loans to alliedhealth personnel in training or retraining programs established by training centers for the allied- health professions and other public or profit agencies. organizations or institutions. the scholarships shall  exceed $2.000 per annum plus $600 for each dependent to exceed threeand the loans shall  exceed $1.500 in any one year. for the purpose of the scholarship grants. $1.750.000 is authorized to be appropriated for the first year and for the purpose of loans $1.500.000 for the first year. fourth. establish a national advisory council on training in the allied health professions. composed of the surgeon general and 16 members chosen by the secretary of hew from among leading authorities in health and education and the general public. the appointments would be for staggered terms. the council would conduct a study of existing laws governing licensing and certification standards in the alliedhealth professions and would offer a model code in an effort to maximize proper and efficient utilization of the allied health professions in meeting the nations health needs. and fifth. provide that an eligible veteran pursuing a course of study in any one of the alliedhealth professions shall be entitled to receive  only a scholarship grant. loan. or other educational allowance provided by law but also that such educational assistance allowance shall  disqualify him from educational benefits that the veteran would otherwise have been entitled to receive. my bill is  intended to replace existing legislation which  provides resources to educational and training institutions that presently support allied health training. but to supplement such legislation. . in this time of crisis in the health care of our nation i believe we should analyze the new techogies available and explore the real possibility of finding new sources of manpower capable of performing many of the functions  carried out by highly skilled and scarce professional personnel. we must make every effort to permit technically qualified individualsparticularly military corpsmento meet employment requirements in the civilian healthcare fields. we must act  to prevent the further "breakdown"-as secretary finch so aptly put itof this countrys system of health care. we must counteract the lack of adequate health manpower as we aspire to bring the full potential of modern medicine to all our citizens.
. i invite the attention of the senate to a number of progressive developments which are taking place in one of our most important domestic antipoverty efforts--the vista program. this peopletopeople program has enabled thousands of americans from the ages of 18 to 80 to make a personal commitment and a real contribution to the struggle for human dignity and equality. vista volunteers have served in urban ghettos and in rural communities. in appalachia and on indian reservations. among migrant workers and among the mentally retarded. under the fine leadership of padraic kennedy. vista has begun to recruit increasing numbers of specialists and other highly skilled persons. who are able to contribute additional expertise and talent to the solution of the myriad problems encountered by vista volunteers. hundreds of lawyers. education specialists. health workers. architects. teachers in the arts. and planners have been accepted for training programs during july and august. equally important. an increasing number of vista volunteers have been recruited from among the ranks of the poor to work in their own communities. these two trends will undoubtedly strengthen the solid contribution which vista workers have made to our antipoverty efforts. in addition. director donald rumsfeld has indicated that the office of ecoic opportunity hopes to involve vista workers in its plans to improve the outreach and delivery of expanded food and nutrition programs. working in cooperation with local community action agencies. vista volunteers will aid in identifying persons in need of assistance. informing them about available programs. helping those who qualify to establish eligibility and gain access to food and nutrition programs. and providing nutrition and consumer education. the injection of talented. idealistic. and hardworking vista workers into food and nutrition outreach programs promises to be of great benefit to our heretofore inadequate efforts in overcoming hunger and malnutrition in america. i have long supported this excellent program. in which my own daughter. joy. is presently serving as a summer volunteer. i ask unanimous consent that an article written by benjamin welles and published in the new york times of july 6. which further describes the outstanding gains recorded by the vista program. be printed in the record.
. i call to the attention of the senate a very seriout situation involving the national institutes of health. i understand the necessity to reduce federal spending as a curb to inflationary pressures. i believe we must properly shape the dimension of federal support of medical research and education in terms of ordering our priorities as we reduce federal spending. because we have a very serious health crisis in this country. i am very concerned that the reduced budget for the nih--culminating in the recently annced nih warning to medical research centers that they may have to close down for lack of funds and that all research grants up for renewal by nih will be severely cut back--may be false ecoy. i ask unanimous consent that an editorial on this subject in the new york times. entitled "false medical ecoy." under date of september 10. 1969.. may be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at the next printing. the name of the senator from new mexico be added as a cosponsor of s. 2482. to amend the public health service act so as to add to such act a new title dealing especially with kidney disease and kidneyrelated diseases.
. the latest target of the john birch society appears to be the sex information and education council of the united statesan organization founded to publish sex education study guides for teachers and advise schools and agencies how to set up such programs. siecus. a profit organization. was founded 5 years ago by a distinguished new yorker. dr. mary calderone. its board of directors includes physicians. educators. and clergymen. i am particularly disturbed that the birch society attack has focused. in a personal way. on dr. calderone. the daughter of edward steichen. the photographer. and the niece of carl sandburg. she has had a distinguished career as a physician and for some years was medical director of the planned parenthood federation. dr. calderone has received awards for her work from the national council of women of the united states. the editors of whos who of american women. and the university of rochester. this year. vogue magazine hoed her as one of americas outstanding women. in order that the public and the congress may have the full story on siecus and dr. calderone. i ask unanimous consent that an article from the new york times of september 14. and an article from look magazine of september 9 be printed in the record. both articles detail the propaganda campaign against siecus and identify its source.
. that the entire nation shares the responsibility for this tragic situation. witness after witness who testified on this bill stressed americas complete insensitivity to the problem of black lung until very recentlyit was  until the mld1950s that black lung was recognized by responsible medical authorities as a disease. britain. on the other hand. began to recognize the disease in 1934. and it became compensable in 1943. in the united states. until last year. only three states recognized black lung as a compensable disease. in other states the only way miners could receive compensation is if they could convince examining boards they had silicosis. which usually was  possible. one former miner who appeared before the committee testified to the difficulty he had encountered obtaining compensation in west virginia. to prove his case he was forced. at his own expense of over $1.300. to have a biopsy taken. and even then he only received a 40percent disability award based on silicosis. this case is the rule.  the exception. through the years. american authorities have been almost exclusively concerned with silicosis. withstanding that black lung probably affects more workers. with worse results. than does silicosis. this preoccupation with silicosis. and consequent insensitivity to black lung was developed most clearly in the testimony of dr. lorin kerr of the united mine workers welfare and retirement fund. i ask that the relevant excerpts from dr. kerrs testimony be printed in the record.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. the child nutrition aot of 1969. and i ask unanimous consent that my testimony before the senate agriculture committee this morning. which explains the bill and its provisions. be printed in the record at this point.
. it just does  make sense to have our medical schools on the brink of disaster when their contributions to the health of the nation are so vital. i k of at least three distinguished institutions in new york statethe new york medical college. the new york university school of medicine and albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva universityfacing an acute financial crisis which is threatening their very survival. i also understand that numerous medical schools and research institutions in the nation are reported to be cutting back their programs because of reduced medicaid reimbursements and federal research grants. even our great staterun institutions. which are attempting to develop and expand to meet pressing needs. are finding it difficult to obtain funds from state sources to enable them to meet their responsibilities. to meet the fiscal crisisa crisis with the gravest moral and humanitarian implicationsfacing medical schools and research institutions in new york state. i have called this emergency meeting of the deans of all 12 medical schools throughout the state. what i hope will come out of this meeting are a set of recommendations and a bill of particulars to present to health. education. and welfare secretary finch. listing all the vital programs of these institutions that are being cut back or eliminated altogether as a result of the drastic cuts in medicaid reimbursements and federal funding. these recommendations and particulars will also be presented to the new york state health department. but i must stress that the primary responsibility for meeting this emergency rests squarely with the federal government. this. of course. is true for every state in the union. the effects of research cuts reverberate throughout a medical school. affecting teaching and graduate training as well as science. when budget cuts slice deeply into funds for researchtraining grants and fellowships. the effect is to dry up the supply of future teachers who will be needed to produce the larger numbers of doctors that both the present and earlier administrations have said our nation must have. the administration must provide the funds if we are to solve the health manpower problem. i believe that the proposed federal budget for health programs. so vital to the continued existence of our medical schools. and at a time when their resources -are greatly needed by all america. is insufficient in our ordering of priorities. my survey of the 1970 budget for the department of health. education. and welfare shows why medical schoolswhich have a major part of their support furnished through federal grantsare in such dire financial straits. we have a $15.600.000 appropriations shortfall for institutional and special project grants. a $44.000.000 appropriations shortfall for construction and reation of educational facilities and a $20.000.000 appropriations shortfall for healthresearch construction grants. to mention but a few. then let us look at but some of our more established research programs. the national cancer institute estimated it needed $203.741.000. but only $180.725.000 is scheduled to be appropriateda $23.000.000 shortfall. and yet last year there were 615.000 new cancer cases and cancer mortality is steadily increasing. the national heart institute estimated it needed $186.708.000. but only $160.513.000 is scheduled to be appropriateda $26.000.000 shortfall. and yet diseases of the heart and circulatory system are the major cause of death in the united states and account for 54 percent of all deaths. the national institute of child health and human development estimated it needed $85.065.000. but only $75.852.000 is scheduled to be appropriateda $10.000.000 shortfall. and yet uncontrolled population growth is one of the most critical problems of our time. affecting the health and wellbeing of everyone. i could go on and on. for each of the divisions of the national institutes of health. but the story is all too clear from these few examples. student assistance programswhich include traineeships. scholarships. and opportunity grantswere reduced by the bureau of the budget by $21.500.000. as an emergency measureto avoid the pending financial disaster of our medical schoolsi would recommend that we act  to appropriate less than $100.000.000 to offset the states reduced appropriations. such funding would be similar to disaster relief programs we have previously enacted to meet the ravages of flood and hurricane. only this time it is our entire nation that faces disastera health crisis--if our medical schools can meet the existing financial crisis. if we are to meet the critical shortage of physiciansestimated at 52.000 this yearwe must allocate sufficient resources to establish a federal commitment to assist schools of medicine in increasing their output of physicians as rapidly as possible. we in congress have passed the laws to help us to accomplish this goal.  we must be certain that there are increased appropriations to meet this objective.  cutbacks which place the medical schools in financial straits. causing them to curtail programs or contemplate closing down altogether. the carnegie commission has reported that it will take $500.000.000 to begin to put our nations medical schools on the road to recovery. while i understand the necessity to reduce federal spending as a curb to inflationary pressures. i believe we must reorder our priorities so that federal support of medical research and education is sufficient to meet the challenge of a burgeoning health crisis. i believe that federal funding for our medical colleges is an investment in the health care of the people and that we can afford to permit it to regress.
. the special subcommittee on alcoholism and narcotics recently concluded hearingsunder the able leadership of the senator from iowa -at the mount sinai medical center in new york city. i have long been concerned about the problem of heroin addictiona matter of much anxiety and yet. paradoxically. little action by our nation. i have long stressed that narcotic addiction and drug abusea complex mythridden fieldhas been grossly underfunded by the federal government. what is required is a federal commitmentadequately fundedto state. local. and private programs of research. experimentation in narcotics prevention. and for rehabilitation and aftercare services. the emity of the problem in new york city alone staggers the imagination. the city has records of some 42.000 heroin addicts but that does  include addicts  in prison  in voluntary treatment and it was testified that the number of addicts is more accurately nearer 100.000. the ecoic impactthe cost to citizens and taxpayersexceeds $1 billion a year. the efforts of mount sinaiwithout federal assistanceto help the addicted individuals in its communityeast harlem where there are over 200.000 people and one out of every 100 is a kn heroine addict--through utilization of a methadone maintenance program was testified to by dr. barry stimmel. chief resident medicine and instructor in the department of medicine at mount sinai school of medicine. in view of the controversy surrounding methadone maintenance. and the urgent need to establish a federal commitment to meet the burgeoning problem of narcotic addiction and drug abuse. i commend dr. stimmels testimony to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the record.
. among the nations many goals. few if any are more significant than the availability of highquality medical care for each and every american. secretary of health. education. and welfare. robert h. finch. has addressed himself to this objective in an article entitled "our national health goals." it appears appropriately egh as the feature of the first issue of a new publication for the nations laymen. family health. secretary finch points out critical shortcomings in our present health care services. he outlines remedial programs by the administration. and appeals for cooperation by all segments of the health industry toward meeting the crisis. i ask unanimous consent that that article. published in the october 1969 issue of family health. be printed in the record.
. the only reason i am introducing the bill rather than the senator from colorado is that the bill concerns the jurisdiction of two subcommittees. one of which i am the ranking miity memberalthough i am the ranking member of the full committeeand the other on which the senator from colorado is the ranking miity member. he graciously allowed me to introduce the entire bill. it is my purpose that the bill should be handled insofar as it deals with community mental health facilities. by the senator from colorado as the ranking miity member of the subcommittee on health. this bill assures the administrations commitment to the continuation of the community mental health centers programthe concept of providing care to the mentally ill in the community where they live. where they will have the support of their family and their friends and be more quickly restored to a meaningful role in society. the proposed legislation would extend for an additional 3 years the program of grants to the states for the construction of community mental health centers. in addition. the bill provides support to meet community needs in the prevention and treatment of the critical problems of alcoholism and narcotic addiction. i am pleased that federal support for preventive and curative services for these two major mental health problemsalcoholism and narcotics addictionwill be an integral part of the network of community mental health centers. a matter of great interest and deep concern to senator dominick and to me. the administration bill recognizes the urgent need for even more extended assistance for services to urban and rural poverty areas. all too often these areas designated by the states as those of highest priority. based on an assessment of community need. are  among the first to initiate centers. this is partially due to the difficulty in developing resources to meet the matching requirements because of the low ecoic status of the community. it has become increasingly clear that those in greatest need of communitybased mental health service. the urban and rural poor. have been the least able to effectively organize. plan and raise sufficient funds to compete effectively for federal grant support. the proposed legislation provides that 20 percent of the grant funds appropriated by congress shall be reserved for direct project grants by the secretary to cover up to 90 percent of the cost of community mental health centers which are of special significance by virtue of their meeting the special needs of the disadvantaged for mental health services or by demonstrating new or particularly effective or efficient methods of delivery of mental health services. in order to provide more coordination and encourage greater efficiency in our health system. the bill would add the requirements that the state plan for construction of community mental health centers must be approved by the state comprehensive health planning agency created under the provisions of section 314(a) of the public health service act. and that applications for construction grants be reviewed and commented on by the appropriate areawide health planning agency created under the provisions of section 314(b) of the act. these provisions reflect the administrations concern for improved delivery of servicesauthorized under different programsthrough improved planning coordination. so that we have health and related planning on a state. interstate. and local level taken into account. the bill would extend the period of federal support of staffing of community mental health centers from the present 41/3 years. to 8 years for all centers. and to 10 years in the case of those centers providing services for persons in an area designed by the secretary as an urban or rural poverty area. staffing grants would support a share of all the costs of operation. staff. and maintenance of the centers. rather than being limited to support of the costs of professional and technical personnel as presently authorized. the present arrangement of supporting a portion of the costs of only professional and technical personnel has proved inadequate. support of a portion of initial costs of operation. staffing. and maintenance should be provided in order to assure a more reasonable level of financial assistance in the developmental years and bring about substantial administrative simplification. the bill would also authorize the use of up to 5 percent of the funds appropriated for new staffing grants for support of project grants to assess the need. develop and initiate mental health services in communities designated by the secretary as urban or rural poverty areas. drug abuse and alcoholism programs require strong and continued federal support. preferential matching and a longer period of support are necessary. to meet these objectives. the bill would extend for 3 additional years. the program of grants for the construction and staffing of facilities for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism and narcotics addiction. the maximum federal share of the costs of construction would be increased from 66% percent to 90 percent. existing federal support of professional and technical personnel would be expanded to include a portion of the initial costs of operation. staffing. and maintenance. the period of support would be increased from 4/s years to 10 years and the maximum level of support would be increased. a new program of grants for the development of specialized training programs or materials relating to the provision of services for the prevention or treatment of alcoholism and for the evaluation of such programs is added by the bill. this grant program is similar to the program already authorized for the rehabilitation of narcotic addicts. on behalf of the senator from colorado . i should like to e for the record that the appropriation authorization requested for 3 years by the administration bill would be for "such sums as may be necessary." senator dominicks position against authorizations which do  include a money ceiling is and has been well kn in both the house and the senate. without in any manner reflecting on the merits of the administration bill. senator dominick wants to put senators and the bureau of the budget on ice that he intends to continue to insist that any bill reported by the senate health subcommittee. or any other committee for that matter. specify a ceiling on authorized costs. i am confident--and i am certain that senator dominick and the other cosponsors of the measure share my confidencethat we will have some costs estimates which can be included in the legislation before any action is taken in executive sessions. i ask unanimous consent that a comparison of proposed community mental health centers amendmentsprepared by the department of health. education and welfarebe printed in the record. i believe the administrations detailed legislative proposal will be most valuable to all the members of the health subcommittee of the labor and public welfare committee as we consider community mental health centers legislation in executive session.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at the next printing. the name of the senator from new jersey be added as a cosponsor of s. 3121. to amend the mental retardation facilities and community mental health centers construction act of 1963.
the senator from south dakota gave pretense of having spoken for me. i am sure. because i spoke with him 3 minutes ago. or before. because i mentioned this before. the senator from louisiana has quite accurately stated that i have  agreed to this. i am the ranking miity member of the nutrition subcommittee. and i gave ice about this matter to the majority leader and on our own side that i wanted to have ice of this proceeding. i think we can get together. and i am very sympathetic to this point of view. but i would hope that the senators concerned would give me a minute to catch my breath and permit the senator from mississippi to continue. i have a guest downstairs. and i will be back in 15 minutes. and i am sure we can settle the matter.
. as in legislative session. and out of order. i introduce for myself and 25 other senators a bill that would authorize an additional $100 million in grants as a form of emergency relief to our nations medical and dental schools. many of which are in great financial distress and in danger of being forced to curtail teaching and research programs or to close down altogether. this is a crisis with the gravest humanitarian implications. and my bill is designed to enable these schools to continue programs and services that are in the national interest. joining as cosponsors in the introduction of the bill are senators bayh.
i. too. share the concern expressed by my colleague that  only should president nixon continue to support an appropriation equal to the full amount  authorized for section 314 (e) project grants. but also. that the secretary will fund rat control projectsas we have both been assuredat the same dollar level as in 1969 when $15.000.000 was made available to support basic education and health education programs directed at rat control. in the light of the estimated $1 billion damage annually incurred by rats in the united states. this $15 million appropriation is a prudent investment. it is a modest proportion of the more than $3 billion spent annually to dispose of the millions of tons of garbage and trash which harbor rats. in human rather than ecoic terms. it becomes even more criticalapproximately 14.000 cases of rat bites are reported annually in our country. in my state of new york. the state has appropriated approximately $2.3 millionand local communities $350.000for programs which seek to exterminate rats and eliminate their harborages and food and water supplies. in addition. the state health department is carrying out research in rodent control. i might add that rats are both an urban and rural problem. while thought of widely as a problem principally affecting the slum dweller. this year the press reported a large colony of rats infesting an exclusive block of park avenue in new york city bringing home the realization that the rat problem belongs to us all. as one citizen was quoted as saying: "the idea of rats crawling around on children in the ghetto really hits home when you see them on park avenue."
. i commend to the attention of senators a series of three articles on alcoholism written by colman mccarthy and published recently in the washington post. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the articles. entitled "alcohol: the iged drug with the polished image." "getting off the bottle and staying off." and "alcohols indecent disease." be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. the senator from utah ( of the special alcoholism and narcotics subcommittee. of which i am the ranking miity member hereafter. has given the fight on alcoholismthe fourth major "disease" in americathe energy and the leadership which the consummation of this total effort requires. senator hughes has been tireless in leading the fight against alcoholism and has conducted hearings on the problem in washington. new york. los angeles. and denver. in an effort to focus attention of the public on the disease afflicting approximately 5 million americans. senator hughes may have been reluctant to call this series of articles to the attention of the senate because of the prominencerightfully give his own role in the fight against alcoholism. therefore. i have taken the liberty of placing the series of articles in the record.
i wish the senator could help them in some way. . i ask unanimous consent that a statement by the senator from kansas on the subject of continuation of the select committee on nutrition and human needs be printed in the record. and also state to the senate. on request of the senator from illis . that he supports both the extension and the appropriations for this committee.
. i have joined with the senator from south dakota . the chairman of the select committee on nutrition and human needs. on which i serve as the ranking miity member. and seven other senators. in the introduction of certain amendments to s. 2548. i think that this measure. of which senator talmadge was the principal author. provides a good base on which to proceed. i believe that any contribution we may make with our amendments is only designed to strengthen and fortify what i already consider to be a significant and creative contribution in the critically important field of child nutrition. i send to the desk. for printing. under the rule. two amendments on behalf of myself. senators cook. hart. kennedy. mondale. mcgovern. pell. percy. and
. at this time. i am withdrawing my second amendment.  509. an amendment to allow schools to utilize private food management companies in the provision of nutritious meals to children in federally assisted child feeding programs. i first introduced this concept in my omnibus hunger bill in august of last year and reintroduced it in revised form in my child nutrition act of 1969. on which the committee on agriculture conducted hearings.
i thank my colleague from illis. the senator is a consponsor of this amendment and has expressed the deepest interest and has helped work on it. the letter from the department of agriculture ackledges the valuable contribution of dr. jean mayer who planned the white house conference on nutrition in bringing about this result. on that basis. . i withdraw my amendment.
. regretably when the senate acted upon s. 3246. the controlled dangerous substances act of 1969. i was out of the country on official senate business and was unable to support the amendments offered by the senator from iowa . chairman of the special alcoholism and narcotics subcommittee. of which i am the ranking miity member. i was particularly concerned by the senates failure to place primary jurisdiction for drug control. restriction. and scheduling in the department of health. education. and welfare rather than in the department of justice. the adverse reaction of the scientific community and the serious effects of this legislation upon the nations medical profession are set forth in an article on drug abuse entitled "the cost of silence ." published in the february 26. 1970 issue of the medical tribune. it is  necessary to agree with every statement in this articleand i do to appreciate its importance to the subject. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the article be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. the author of this timely article is dr. daniel x. freedman. chairman of the department of psychiatry. pritzker school of medicine. university of chicago and chairman of the task force on drug abuse and youth of the american psychiatric association. one of the nations outstanding authorities on the drug scene. i commend the reading of this article to senators. perhaps. when we have the opportunity again to consider s. 3246. when the other body has acted upon it. we can take into consideration dr. freedmans expertise in our deliberations.
. it was very disheartening to read that deaths from pulmonary emphysema. have dramatically increased in new york city over the last 10 years. this is only the latest evidence that air pollution is one of the great dangers to the health of the american people. an article published in the new york times. of march 12. fully discusses the air pollution. the water pollution. and the se pollution problems. the se problem is one which has  received adequate attention and is rapidly becoming also a great threat to the life of the city dweller. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
. in cooperation with many technical experts and distinguished people interested in the field throughout the country. i have had his measure in preparation for months. it represents the culmination of an emous amount of effort. i introduce it as my own contribution to what i am confident will be a significant debate and. in my judgment. within a year or two. at the most will result in the successful adoption of a national health program which will assure high quality health care to every american. whatever may be his ecoic need. this is one of the really basic reforms of our time. standing on a level with social security. unemployment compensation. the tremendous civil rights act of 1964. the war on poverty. the ecoic opportunity act. and other recognitions by our country of the great social needs of our people. which have developed over the decades. this bill is my own way of meeting that need. a number of other bills have been and will be introduced. i hope very much the administration will come forward with its program. i believe that. as we did with medicare and medicaid. where i worked so closely with the most distinguished and beloved senator from new mexico
 has recently proposed. in his message of march 19 on higher education. a career education program starting in fiscal year 1972. which should contribute to the supply of allied health personnel. accordingly. we believe a oneyear extension of this legislation is the appropriate course at the present time. such an extension will make the present allied health program authorizations cotermis with the other health manpower authorizations. and will permit an assessment of the potential role of the proposed career education program in relation to the allied health program. we are making an acrosstheboard assessment of health manpower programs in terms of their interrelationships and their impact on the health needs of the nation. we consider such an assessment to be absolutely essential if we are to fulfill our responsibilities to the nation to increase  only the number of health service personnel. but the breadth and quality of their services. our examination will take into account the programs of other federal agencies which are contributing to meeting health manpower needs. we shall continue our review of the allied health program as part of this overall assessment and. upon its completion. we will present to the congress our legislative recommendations relating to all the health manpower authorities. in the interim. however. the changes we are proposing in the attached bill will enable us to move forward without delay toward the achievement of certain urgent allied health manpower objectives. the proposed administration legislation would: first. extend the authority for basic improvementformula--grants for training centers for allied health professions. second. separate the special improvement grant authority from its present dependence on the basic improvement grant. third. replace the present section 792 (c) authority for special improvement grants with new broad. flexible authority for special projects for experimentation. demonstration. and institutional improvement. and consolidates the authorities of section 794 of the public health service actdevelopmental grants--into the new section 792(c). fourth. extend the authority for advanced traineeships. and broaden the eligible institutions to include other agencies. organizations. or institutions which provide such training. in addition to currently eligible training centers. fifth. extend the authority for construction of teaching facilities for training centers for allied health professions. i am very hopeful that the health subcommittee of the labor and public welfare committee. of which i am ranking miity member. under the chairmanship of senator ralph yarborough. who also has introduced allied health professions legislationwhich incorporates many features in the administration bill and my own bill. s. 2753will carefully consider -the pending -allied health professions legislation and bring together the best legislation to meet the acute shortage of manpower in the allied health professions. in closing. i might e that one of our greatest concernsin helping overcome the critical manpower shortagesis the need for conducting a comprehensive study of existing laws. regulations. customs. and practices governing the licensing. certification. or other means by which individuals are determined to be qualified to practice in the allied health professions. on the basis of the information obtained from the study. and with the advice and assistance of appropriate state and local agencies. professional groups. and other appropriate groups and organizations we should recommend to states and professional groups model codes relating to the classification of the various occupations and specialties within the allied health professions. the standards which must be met by personnel qualified to engage in such occupations or specialties. and the licensing. certification. or other procedures to be employed in determining whether individuals meet such standardsprovided for by my bill. s. 2753.
. in closing the debate i join the many senators who have paid tribute to the distinguished senator from texas who handled the conference on the matter of health in such a splendid manner. he is a very fitting successorand this is praiseto the fine former senator from alabama . his leadership and respect for the whole new orientation to the health field have characterized the movement in our country in recent years.
there is question about it. there is a large substantive reason for that and it is this. the people talking about withdrawal must face a very hard fact. things may go very wrong in vietnam when we withdraw. we can avoid that. they may go very wrong. we must be prepared to face it. we can guarantee success in withdrawal any more than the president could guarantee success if he stays. indeed. i think he is less likely to have success if he stays. so things may go very wrong. and in terms of the future of our country. i think it is critically important. especially in view of that as a possibility. that the congress and the president share the responsibility. so that neither one is in the position of saying to the other. "i told you so." which i think is very important to the future health of our country.
 of the mount sinai medical center in new york and dean of the medical school recently testifled before the appropriations subcommittee for the departments of labor. and health. education. and welfare. his testimony shows that the medical schools of our country are anxious to help solve the health manpower crisis. but are prevented from doing their best because sufficient funds have  been appropriated. he has also analyzed the difficulties facing medical students. especially in the crucial area of student loans. i commend his testimony to the attention of senators and ask unanimous consent that the full text of dr. james testimony be printed in the record.
. in the first place.  only must the medical or dental school show real need. but they must show that. by maintaining their statusin other words. being rescued--they will contribute materially to the national effort to deal with the grave shortages in health personnel. i ask unanimous consent that. as a part of my remarks. i be permitted to have printed in the record the provisions of section 799(k) (2). which specifies exactly what schools we are trying to reach. and also that there be printed in the record section 799 (n) . specifying the purposes for which we are saving. if we are able to save them. these institutions. and also showing the grave financial distress. which alone will qualify them in order to get this emergency relief.
. while i join with the chairman and agree with him that this particular provision be strickenbecause we feel this bill is so important that we do  want it held up in any way and have people feel that they have to make a fight on it for reasons which have hing to do with its substance or meritsi hope very much that the members of the house will give it their sympathetic consideration and that some way may be found to reclaim for the allied health professions this indispensable and irreplaceable corps of medical corpsmen and veterans with experience in a health field who leave the armed services. to attract them into the profession which they have learned in the armed forces. other than that. i commend the bill most highly to my colleagues. i think it is a real tribute to the senator from texas
. the leadership of the senator from texas in health matters has been most enviable and a great credit to the people of texas who sent him here. it is an indication of his high character and dedication. he needs greater compliment than to say it was a splendid exercise of leadership in the finest traditions of our former committee chairman. former senator hill. of alabama. who was probably the leading senator in our history in terms of advances in the field of health care and research. i am very hoed and privileged to have been associated with the senator from texas in this endeavor.
 of the national fund for medical education. outlines the nature of the problems facing the medical schools. the report examines and clarifies the nature of the costs on the one hand and the services. on the other. of the medical school and its affiliated teaching hospitals and medical centers. too often. in assessing the costs of medical education. some forget that university medical centers supply medical service to the public. for example. at least one out of every nine patients admitted to a hospital goes to a primary or secondary teaching hospital. i commend this report to the senate and ask unanimous consent that the text of the report entitled "toward a better understanding of the crisis in medical education" be printed in the record.
i thank the senator. on this particular item. i wish to report to the senate that it is a matter in which the senator from california took the lead" in the senate chamber. i happily joined with him. the senator from california and i have two outstanding examples of why this $20 million for constiuction of hospital and domiciliary facilities was needed and why the situation is so serious. i have in my state the bronx veterans administration hospital and the senator from california has in his state the socalled wadsworth los angeles veterans administration center. the bronx veterans administration hospital is a heartbreaking situation. the physicians. nurses. and other health personnel are trying very hard and striving manfully with insufficient facilities and personnel.. attributable to the lack of money. to provide quality health care to our veterans. there are examples of severe space and equipment shortages. which have had an adverse impact on patient care that are shocking. there are. for example. day rooms in many wards. the treatment room in the spinal cord injury ward is also used for storage and water pitcher service. the shower and enemy room for the paraplegic and quadraplegic patients is one and the same and the room is  temperature controlled. there is a severe shortage of lab rooms. there is a shortage of therapy equipment in the adl (active daily living) room where the spinal cord injury patients receive therapy desiged to teach them ambulatory skills and offer necessary daily living skills. and much of the hospital traffic has to go through the wards. which makes a very bad situation for the patients. these are untolerable and wholly inadequate conditions for providing uptodate. quality health care for our veterans. i k of senator in the chamber who would fight harder and more effectively or more vigorously than the senator from rhode island . but one is greatly affected by the sheer heartbreaking character of the situation itself. i visited the veterans administration hospital in buffalo yesterday. that is a very good hosiptal which is well run. the difference in the demea and outlook of the patients is visible but it breaks ones heart to see young men without an arm or without a leg.
yes. it is the most terrible thing in the world. i spread this on the record only because this is a continuing thing. in a recent survey by  of the house veterans affairs committee. the deficiency for construction and modernization of the va hospitals in new york state was revealed to be $12.587.669. thus $12 million plus deficiency included only the following items: "purchase of new and replacement" equipment and "recurring and recurring maintenance and repair." it did  include funding deficiencies for dental care. recruiting necessary medical personnel. and so forth. which brought the total funding shortages for new york to $25.397.162. i k the senator and his conferees have done everything they humanly could do. i hope that by the reiteration of the consequences of these denials we may reach the hearts and minds of some colleagues who may  feel as we do. and that we will have better success in a supplemental. or setting. priorities in the expenditure of uligated carryover construction funds. or on aher occasion.
 . this is a milestone which we are facing  so much in the declaration of alcoholism as a disease or an illness or a public health problembecause the courts have recognized that and we have recognized it in the law to which i previously referred. public law 91211. which was passed in 1970but in the size and scope of the treatment we are prepared to afford and the resources we have prepared to make available at this time. whether or  the issue of resources is challenged. i should like to address myself to thatthat is. the authorization for appropriationsbecause it is only fair to our colleagues that an explanation should be of record. some of the best testimony on this score comes from the department itself. and i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the letter addressed to me. dated june 19. 1970. by dr. roger 0. egeberg. assistant secretary for health and scientific affairs.
. based upon those analyses. i deeply believe that the figures we have been given by dr. egeberg. though they seem to reduce materially the figures in the bill. go far to sustain them rather than the other way. the second item of appropriation deals with the state program. the state formula grants. in that respect. i should like to point out that the formulation of those grants is a very important one. that is the basis upon which they will be given. for it relates to relative population. financial need. and. very importantly. the need for more effective prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs in the alcoholism field. there. i believe. is a key element in what we must try to accomplish. for we have found that the carrot and the stick approach with the states is extremely persuasive and extremely helpful. we offer each state as much as $200.000 as a basic formula grant. but if the state is to participate. and we have a right to expect that its own people will urge the state effectively to participate. then the states must really establish. under the bill. a comprehensive program for the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. commensurate with the extent of the problem in the particular state. the specifications are very exact and constructive. which will bring the state into the scheme of effort to enforce what we are seeking to bring about in an effective way. to indicate the amounts which are available under the $20 million. first year authorization to the states. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a table of estimated formula pared by the department at our request but does  represent a commitment to grants to the states. this table was prethem to seek such funding appropriations.
. i should like to give one estimate of these loss figures as compiled by the health department of new york cityfor new york city alone. which represents 5 percent of the population of the country. the department estimates are as follows: welfare costs-$150 million. lowered job productivity-$260 million. yearly deaths (loss of record)-$210 million. traffic fatalities---$50 million. injuries and property damage-$210 million. that comes to a figure of $880 million. approximately $1 billion a year. for new york city alone. attributable directly to alcoholism. indeed. a phrase has been coined for the loss to american business at the national level of the ecoic waste due to alcoholism. "industrys $7 billion hangover." as a measure of demonstrating precisely what is at stake. in his report in the letter which i have had placed in the record. dr. egeberg states: the needs implied by the legislative objectives of s. 3835 are extremely substantial. a history of neglect by the nations health service system creates a need for rather emous federal investments to seek solutions to the problems of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. that. i think. symbolizes what we have tried to accomplish in respect to the bill. i might say that i consider it a matter of single achievement by us. and the fact that the senator from colorado
. this is exactly the amendment offered by the senator from texas . it relates to compensation of members of the public health service advisory council and committees which are established under this bill. current provisions of the phs act relating to compensation of members of the public health service advisory councils and committees establish varying and widely disparate rates of remuneration for the members of these various groups. at present. and for discernible reason. some groups are entitled to less than half of the compensation available to the membership of others. these proposed amendments will permit the establishment of uniform rates of compensation for all members of these councils and committees and will thus insure consistent and equitable treatment. they authorize compensation at rates to be fixed by the secretary.  to exceed the maximum rate specified at the time of service for grade gs18. they provide for a uniform method of payment for expenses including per diem in lieu of subsistence as authorized for persons in the government service employed intermittently. the advisory councils and committees play a major role in the nih programs and those of other public health service agencies. equitable treatment of their membership in the manner of compensation is in keeping with the importance of their responsibilities. also. the amendment being submitted is similar to part c of the general education provisions act and represents the administrations effortwhich acts here through me. as i am the ranking miity member of the committee---to bring about this degree of uniformity. again i express my gratitude to the senator from texas . i hope the senate will take favorable action on this amendment.
. the research contracting authority of the public health service will expire on june 30. 1971. the amendment proposed will extend the authority for an indefinite period of time. deleting present time limitation under section 301(b) of the public health service act. the use of this authority is to complement basic researchconducted in universities and other profit organizationssupported through the grantinaid. it is used when the government is seeking highly specific and sharply circumscribed research results. this instrumentthe research contractis particularly appropriate for applied research or techogical development efforts intended to exploit most expeditiously and efficiently discoveries arising out of grantsupported basic research programs. industrial firms. which are  eligible for phs grantsinaid. have been able to make significant contributions to a number of phs research programs through existing research contract authority. this would make the provision for contract authority consistent with the provision for grant authority. i hope the senate will act favorably on the amendment.
. this proposal amends section 442 of the public health service act to permit the national institute of general medical sciences to support clinical. as well as research. training related to its mission and thus to make the scope of its training authorities identical to those of the other institutes. the national institute of general medical sciences as well as its predecessor. the division of general medical sciences. initially was assigned responsibility for the basic and preclinical medical sciences. the scope of this institutes program has gradually evolved to include several clinical sciences. for example. anesthesiology and radiology. in which there are critical shortages of training specialists and seriously limited national institutional capacity for the training of those clinical specialists. historically. the national institutes of health effectively solved such problems in many other fields. this mi alteration in the requested authority will enable the nigms similarly to meet urgently important national needs within its domain of responsibility. i hope the senate will act favorably on the amendment.
i would first like to commend my colleague from new york on the initiative which he took immediately upon the happening of the hijacking in suggesting a course which can be pursued by our country in so delicate and dangerous a situation. and which he has put into bill form. in view of the discretionary power given to the president in respect of the socalled third countries. which i thought was essential in order to have a balanced measure. this is  only a matter of tremendous humanitarian importance. brigandage and piracy have been kn to mankind almost from the beginning of history. but it seems to all of us so extraordinary that it should happen in a modem day. yet when there is an area which is completely incapabale of controlling lawlessness. such as this particular area in jordan. a matter like this is bound to follow. therefore. i think the united states has to consider remedial measures. we are speaking here in terms of a relatively mild measure compared to the history of our country in regard to matters of this nature. back at the founda. tion of this country president jefferson employed the armed forces of the united states against the barbary pirates. and in very recent times president eisenhower. withstanding his emous reluctance to use the armed forces of the united states abroad. sent the marines into leba when grave disorder threatened there. on the invitation of that government. the same thing took place in santo domingo. with the understanding that it was necessary in order to preserve american lives and deal with the presence of the americans who were in santo domingo at the time. there is a very dangerous and inflammatory situation. and one here wants to increase it in any way by use of military action or military force. i agree with senator goodell in that respect. also. i wish to commend. as i did yesterday. and do so again today. the president and the secretary of state for their actions in respect to americans lives and their egalitarian outlook as to the fate of all the americans involved. and indeed. the people of all the nations. .the presidenthas handled this matter with great tact and great skill. i would also like to take a moment to commend the representative of the international red cross.  and the secretary of state for their handling of one of the most trying. in the human sense crises which have faced our country in a considerable period of time.
. including the romantic vision of the country doctor called out of bed at 3 or 4 oclock in the morning and. in his horsedrawn buggy. driving through the rain or s to attend a sick patient. which was as characteristic of the american scene as delivery of the mail. is invoked by this particular measure. i hope very much that the senate will approve it. as i say. discussion with the senator from colorado on his amendment is a matter of methodology rather than the substantive trust of this measure. i am sure that the senator. very much like the rest of us. feels the same way about the basic element involved here. which is the encouragement of the practice of family medicine. i congratulate the distinguished senator from texas for once more bringing a very fine. highminded and desirable health measure to the floor of the senate. i take but aher few minutes to discuss at this time a title of the bill which is my own i shall be happy to do so.
. the need for improvement in nutritional teaching is readily ackledged by many medical schools. also we have the testimony of harvard university school of public health which in a letter to me dated july 15. 1970. states as follows: dear senator javfts. we who are interested in the nutritional problems of this country appreciate your efforts and i thank you for your letter of june 23. 1970. with specific reference to section 411 on fortified and enriched foods. i would like to raise two questions. it should be clear that the objective is to supply "nutritious food" and this may be achieved with natural products without specific additions of nutrients which would ordinarily be considered under "fortified or enriched foods." i am uncertain as to the legal interpretation of the current wording. secondly. i have been told that oeo has. in fact. funded a few projects of this kind although i have specific information. the usual response of industrial .people to this kind of suggestion has been that while they could prepare cheaper and sometimes better products than those they  market. they see way to sell such products without cutting into their present markets. so. i have some skepticism about how realistic the industry would be in attempting to develop this entire concept although the need for some kind of activity to develop cheaper nutritious products that are acceptable would seem quite clear. the food and nutrition board expects to begin activities very shortly under contract with the food and drug administration to develop some nutritional guidelines for various classes of foods. as you are probably aware. the fortification of some foods is limited by certain standards for specific foods. at the same time. some limitations are necessary since excessive additions of vitamin d to foods have produced severe toxic effects in- children and caution has to be exercised. i assume that this whole area will be redefined in the next year or two. graduate training in nutrition. as in most fields. will probably decrease this year because of limitations in research and training grant funds. most schools are in trouble and some in very serious trouble. i see little that can be done without increased funds for research and training. we should recognize. of course. that the limitation in funds available across the board does provide an opportunity to direct larger numbers of individuals into nutrition. or other fields. provided funds can be made available. at the same time it has to be recognized that research support in nutrition and practically all fields of medicine during the past 20 years or more has emphasized the biochemical and physiological aspects with little attention to the social aspects. as is stated in section 202. "the nation lacks sufficient kledge" to solve the nutrition problems we have. the remainder of title ii. however. appears to me to be based largely upon the supposition that the kledge is more or less adequate and the primary need is to produce new curricula and educate and inform the population. it seems to me that programs of these kinds will  succeed unless a professional core is developed to lead -the program. if nutrition is to be introduced into medical schools. it will presumably be through professors of nutrition in the medical schools and these will  develop unless specific funding is available. similarly. means must be found to develop strong and more comprehensive nutrition programs than  exist in universities. the basic core of nutritionists  available are. in general.  -prepared to develop the comprehensive programs needed. particularly the need to involve the social scientists. the specific areas identified in s. 2789 as requiring more research effort are sound. i think. but it is  clear to me that these will necessarily lead to the kinds of broad training and research programs which are clearly needed. i should like to point out also that nutrition in medicine is a far greater problem than dealing with those diseases related to poverty and undernutrition. the nutritional aspects of renal disease. heart disease. malabsorption syndromes. anemias. allergies. etc.. are also a neglected field and i feel that these kinds of problems also have to be attacked. particularly if we are to obtain the real interest of the medical profession in nutritional problems of this country.. i certainly agree that priorities must be established from the many recommendations of the white house conference. one of the major difficulties at the moment is the inability of most of us to find out exactly what is happening in washington and especially in hew that relates to nutrition. there is need for coordination and evaluation. i am uncertain how this can be best accomplished. if i can be useful at any time. i hope you will call on me. sincerely yours.
. i thank the senator from virginia very much. analysis of title ii of the bill could be concluded without a reference to the work which is being done by the select committee dealing with the subjects of hunger and malnutrition. that committee is headed by the senator from south dakota . i happen to have the ho to be a ranking miity member of that committee. there the evidence. it seems to me. is conclusive with reference to the need for a medical answer to the problems of malnutrition and hunger. these problems are most awful in respect of mothers who are bearing children because we are learning that the effects of malnutrition in the mother may cause a retarded child even before the child is born. i could think of hing worse. we are all accustomed to a bloody worldand it is. yet. there are some things which touch the human heart peculiarly. even though we are accustomed to the tragic suffering and dying in the world. one of those things that touch our hearts deeply is the danger that a child may be completely useless to. itself and to the world for all its life because we had failed to deal with the nutritional problems of the mother bearing that child. with some 20 million americans at the poverty level. this is a problem of vast magnitude. the medical schools are unable to cope with this problem. a number of the medical schools are in danger of closing their doors. practically every medical school in the country is in very deep financial trouble. we passed a bill the other day seeking to bail them out with $100 million of emergency funds. the provision in the bill for authorization for family medical practice and for nutritional education are absolutely essential if we wish to legislate concerning this problem and have that legislation implemented. i hope very much that the senate will pass the bill.
i do  wish to interrupt the senators discourse. but i would just like to serve ice that i. too. as the ranking miity member of the alcoholism and narcotics subcommittee. which the senator heads so effectively. would like to make an opening statement in support of the senators amendment i will appreciate it.
. i am a cosponsor and strongly support amendment  1026 to strike title i of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of 1970the drug abuse rehabilitation and prevention provisions--and substitute in lieu thereof a more comprehensive approach which would establish a major federal commitment to promote effective narcotics addiction and drug abuse prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs. in the sea of controversy over the deadly manmade plaguethe narcotics addiction and drug abuse epidemic afflicting america and its young peoplei believe this amendment stands out as an island of clarity. for the first time we would establish a massive. major national commitment to deter drugrelated crime through prevention. treatment and rehabilitation rather than merely relying uponto dateineffective criminal incarceration. we search through and utilize the complex of social. psychological. cultural. and medical forces to understand why too many of our sons and daughters want to k higher exhilaration than the synthetic kick at the end of a needle. rather than have the problem of narcotics addiction and drug abuse represent the end product of a purely criminal phee. there are. unfortunately. totally reliable data on the prevalence of narcotics addiction and drug abuse. the national institute of mental health estimates there are 100.000 to 125.000 active narcotic abusers in the united states. however. new york city alone has records of more than 40.000 heroin addicts. exclusive of addicts in prison or voluntary treatment. and john v. lindsay. mayor of new york city. has testified that there are 100.000 addicts living in our city. the total number of narcotic drug abusers. including those addicted or habituated to marihuana. lsd. sedatives. stimulants. and related drugs. and certain tranquilizers is estimated at between 250.000 and 500.000 persons nationally. the number of juveniles and adults who have used marihuana at least once is conservatively estimated between 8 and 12 million. the toll in ecoic terms has been set by the former director of the national institute of mental health. dr. yolles. in the range of $2 to $3 billion yearly. in new york city alone. in the age group between 16 and 35. addiction is the largest single cause of accidental death and the total number of addicts who died last year is more than 1.000. the citys medical examiners records indicate that 224 teenagers died of problems caused by heroin in 1969 and of these. 55 were less than 16 years old. in the first 8 months of 1970 there were 582 heroin deaths and of these. 149 were teenagers. we can continue to quote the sad statistics and turn our backs on their substantive implications. it would be ideal if treatment and rehabilitation for narcotics addiction and drug abuse could be handled through community mental health centers or in an institutional setting provided for by title i of the house bill. however. these establishmentoriented treatment and rehabilitation programs are but one facet of the urgently needed allout effort. all the various types of prevention. treatment and rehabilitation programs are required to combat narcotics addiction and drug abuse. to date. the best possibility of reaching youthful addicts. abusers. and experimenters appears to be found in programs arising from community local initiative in response to specific aspects of narcotics addiction. drug abuse. and drug dependence problems. this amendment will offer maximum flexibility in dealing with narcotics addiction and drug abuse community problems at the local neighborhood and grassroots levels. we are deeply concerned in new york city. in addition to our concern with people who use heroin. with the young people of our city who are experimenting with all kinds of drugs in all kinds of neighborhoods. i do  believe that anywhere in this nation there are very many parents. regardless of their ecoic condition or their cultural backgrounds. who are  concerned that their own children. when they reach the age of 12or perhaps even youngermight become involved with that kind of drug experimentation that would lead them into vicious and destructive drug scenes. one of the more important prevention facilities that we have to deal directly with this problem are youth centers. located. for example in new york. throughout the city to deal with youngsters who are experimenting with drugs. who are "acting out" so we can get to them before they become deeply involved in the drug scene. we have parent and citizens groups and offer orientation programs throughout new york city to show all citizens what can be done in terms of community involvement and to stop the spread of drug abuse. we also have community orientation centers throughout the city where we have several hundred addicts in outpatient treatment. in addition to those in our phoenix program. which i will describe shortly. in addition. we have gone into more than 100 of my citys high schools and grammar schools in order to deal with the drug problem which exists there. what we are attempting to do in our schools is. first. to bring to the teachers a sufficient kledge of drugs so that they can begin at least to relate to the students meaningfully on that level. once they have acquired this kledge of drugs. they then must acquire some degree of expertise in dealing with the kinds of problems that youngsters have in leaving drugs. to be able to help them to identify with youngsters leaving drugs and to refer them to our youth centers. a program that we think will lead the way for the rest of the country is the phoenix house program. which is considered to be the very finest rehabilitation program for drug addicts in the world. phoenix houses provide the setting for an addict to look into himself. to begin to deal with the problems and attitudes that have led him to use drugs and to behave in ways which axe detrimental to society. in phoenix houses under the direction of professionals and trained exaddicts and with the cooperation of other residents and former users in treatment. in these selfcontained drugfree communities there quickly develops a sense of responsibility to himself. to his fellows and to the larger society around himand drugs longer play a role in his life. there are but some of the narcotics addiction and drug abuse programs utilized in new yorkthere are many. many other streetfront programs that play a vital role in the war against narcotics addiction and drug abuse. there are methadone maintenance programs. crisis intervention centers. 24hour telephone counseling services. free clinic. peer group leadership programs. and various other excellent therapeutic communities such as odyssey house. these individualized. highly structuredand all too often unstructuredprograms are all. in their own waymaking a significant contribution to the prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation of young people regrettably involved in the drug scene. the extensive hearings. conducted by the alcoholism and narcotics subcommitteeof which i am ranking miity memberon the extent and character of the narcotics addiction and drug abuse problem in the united states made one thing abundantly clear: narcotics addiction and drug abuse is a national problem which does  recognize regional boundaries. to make it possible for all states to stimulate prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs and share in federal financial assistance. the amendmentin addition to the project grant program carrying authorizations for 3 years of $135 millionthe annual establishes a formula grant program of $55.000.000 for 3 years. i might e that the substantial minimum state allotment. $200.000. is recognition of the deep and pervasive seriousness of the narcotics addiction and drug abuse problem. which is a blight upon all america. tragically afflicting our young people. it touches every sector of our society. from the dimly lit corridors of the urban slums to the shopping center parking lots of affluent suburban communities and rural america. it strikes at those in poverty. our middle class and the wealthy and has taken on the proportions of a national epidemic. to be eligible for these federal funds under the formula grant provisions of the amendmentwhereby such allotment is to be made on the basis of relative population. financial need. and need for more effective prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programseach state must develop a drug abuse and drug dependence prevention. treatment and rehabilitation plan meeting certain basic requirements. the plans must designate a single state agency to administer the plan. provide for a state advisory council to oversee the plan. specify the needs of the state and its existing health facilities. meet certain standards of administration. provide required reports and information. and assure that federal funds will be used to supplement rather than supplant federal funds. the secretary shall approve any state plan meeting the statutory requirements. the substitute amendment for title i of h.r. 18583 will enable the nation to embark on a broad program of prevention. treatment and rehabilitation and i urge all my colleagues to support its passage.
. and i shall  detain the senate very long. first. why did  the committee report this amendment as a bill. the committee is unanimously behind this amendment. they have all endorsed it. with more unanimity than we often find in reporting a bill. the reason why we did  report it is that we were very much occupied with writing the alcoholism bill. and we simply could  do both at the same time. but the turn of this comprehensive drug abuse prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation bill was. as it were. right around the bend. we had just recently completed the alcoholism bill. hence. we simply had  caught up with our work for the very good reason. as i have explained. that the alcoholism bill had the priority. quite properly. and we wrote that first. second. and very important. is that the time to act on this matter is . the whole country looks to the federal government for a better answer than it has given. i should like to pay all ho and tributehe was  present yesterday when i said thisto the senator from arkansas . opposite whom i sat in the judiciary committee. when the first provision with respect to rehabilitation and the medical treatment of narcotics addicts was tacked onto aher bill and the first money was providedapproximately $15 million. it is  time that we took the second major step. well implemented. well thought out. based upon very extensive hearings. this will be a meaningful contribution to the efforts of states and cities like my own. new york is unhappily the narcotics addiction capital of the united states. that it is a terribly depressing thing to say. because we think that as much as 50 percent of our crime is attributable to the issue of narcotics addiction. it is a dreadful thing for the largest city in the united states. the way to meet it is to give us a well articulated plan at the earliest possible moment. and this is the earliest possible moment. so i hope that the senate will act in answer to this national exigency. withstanding. with the greatest deference and respect to the feeling of the managers of the bill on both sides. that it will present problems to them in the negotiations. i think that we have a right to have confidence in them. that if the senate says it wants this. they will negotiate the problems in respect to criminal prosecution. which senator hruska. as i have said. has quite properly pointed out. and will retain the very best features of the bill. in conclusion. we have tried the criminal route time and again. we tried it 20 years back. when i was a member of the house of representatives. we passed the boggs bill. very much escalating the penalties on pushers and dealers. and  we still have the biggest narcotics problem that the country has seen. some other approach is needed to assist the various new york city addiction services agency and community prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs such as the following: new york city narcotic addiction and drug abuse programs type: approximate  therapeutic communities ------------30 day care centers --------------------- 10 community orientation centers ------- 40 youth centers -----------------------21 detoxification facilities ---------------4 confinement facilities --------------- 4 teacher training programs ----------- 100 methadone maintenance programs .... 10 peer group leadership programs ------- 12 examples of above: 1. phoenix house. daytop. logos. samaritan harlem confrontation. exodus. harlem arc. 2. reality house. samaritan hospital. 3. brownsville coc. south jamaica coc. harlem coc. queens coc. 4. ditto  3. 5. lincoln. beth israel. harlem. interfaith hospitals. 6. edgecomb. manhattan rehab. 7 & 9. public schools. 8. beth israel. mt. sinai. harlem & roosevelt hospitals. that is what is sought to be accomplished by the hughes amendment. i hope very much that the senate will adopt it
. i send to the desk an amendment to the occupational health and safety act which deals with enforcement of the act. it is essentially the compromise that i offered in cormmittee which was unhappily and unfortunately rejected and has brought us so much trouble. i think. because it was rejected. i think that we might find some way of composing our differences and producing a bill with the aid of this particular method of compromise. i ask unanimous consent that the amendment be printed in the record.
yes. but i meant insofar as you were concerned. my reason for speaking is that i do  want it to go down in history that we just. as it were i believe we will pass the substitute amendment to title i of h.r. 18583 in the senate. it is a counterpart to the house bill. and ultimately we will have a national institute to deal with the drug abuse problem. which we should have. which for the moment was eliminated by the conference report. however. the conference has improved upon the provisions contained in title i of h.r. 18583 relating to rebilitation. prevention. and treatment for drug abuse and drug dependence. it has emously beefed up with moneyan additional $25 million in authorizations for special project grantsand authority the whole of the u.s. prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation program concerning narcotics addiction and drug abuse. the original man who gave us the original push was the senator from arkansas himself. who included in a bill which came out of the judiciary committee for the first time such an approach to the narcotics addiction problem. with an authorization of $15 million.  this concept. matured and developed in the committee on labor and public welfare. and also in the conference which i had the ho to be an active participant. with the idea of having the community mental health centers accommodate those who needed to be treated for drug abuse and narcotic addiction.  we are going through a broader program with major changes which are of critical importance to every big city. first is the right of the. secretary to make special project grants specifically for the treatment and rehabilitation of narcotics addiction or drug dependent persons. that is  broadened so that he may give money  for a combination of purposes onlyto wit. detoxiflcation services. or institutional services (including medical. psychological or counseling services) or communitybased aftercare -services. but for any one of those individual programs or services. when we join that new authority with the established structure by which such care is afforded. we see the advances made. aher big expansion is in the community health centerswhere we  have 350 when we need 2.000. the big expansion is in public but often someiles private. often mixed projects. right in new york such as phoenix house. .odyssey house. daytop. exodus. harlem arc. and many other therapeutic. communities. youth centers. detoxification facilities. clinics and so forth. which will render one of the services.  allonly one or perhapstwo.  we have expanded the opportunity when we join both. often governmental activities. which are profit. and governmental activities. with this expansion of authority to the secretary. we have opened. up for drug abusers and narcotic addicts who will be treated. with means  available for treating them. a program. institution or facility for treating them which can be helped under this section of the legislation.  content with increased scope of program. we also. as i previously indicated. beefed up the money considerably. the aggregate senate authorizations had exceeded those of the house by -$26 million. with tremendous support of the members of the conference committee. senators yarborough. randolph. dominick and hughes. who led the fight. we added $25 million of the $26 million to this very program for special project grants. a very significant advance which will have tremendous effect and influence in the days ahead. also. we provided that state health plans. where there is also much more money available for qtate comprehensive health plans. should include provisions for services for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and drug dependent persons commensurate with the extent of the problem in a given state. so there. again. we opened up a totally new field which will be helpful in this regard. we also made clear that where a program of services under special project grants provisions included funds for alteration. expansion. remodeling. and so forth. of an existing facilityrather than new construction of a new facilitythat such program need  be consolidated with aher program. however. where a program established and also funds are provided for construcion of a new facility. thereafter programs established under the special project grants provisionwhere feasiblewill be- consolidated with the program or programs of -the newly constructed facility. aside from the adoption of title i as passed by the senate. which i consider to be essential and a marked change. we must be sure to make in due course. but which the house begged off on. on the grounds that they had hearings to consider the subject. although it promised. as will be seen from reading the conference report. that next year there will be real consideration of the subject. aside from that really historic move in the drug abuse and narcotic addiction situation in the federal establishment which would come with the establishment of a new institute in the national institutes of health. what we have done is a first step forward toward a new plateau for federal determination in the drug abuse field. i hope very much that the senate will approve the conference report.. i feel that this problem is the worst problem we have. it certainly is the worst where i come from. new york city. we have an opportunityfully safeguarded and in the hands of the secretarywith this piece of legislation to really make every dollar appropriated in the federal establishment count the most in this drug problem. i repeat what i have said before. we estimate that as much as 50 percent of the crime in new york city is attributable in one way or aher to narcotics addiction. that is a staggering figure. in terms of human and ecoic loss. however the estimate. it is justified by the facts.
. i support the conference report on the health training improvement act of 1970 . while my amendment to provide $100 million emergency assistance to medical and dental schools was  accepted by the house conferees. some relief has been afforded. my original bill. which passed the senate as an amendment to s. 3586. contained language authorizing up to $100 million for fiscal year 1971 to establish a fund to provide emergency assistance to medical and dental schools in serious financial distress. the house bill contained corresponding provision. the conference substitute would provide some authority to meet the purposes of the amendment. it provides that the $55 million authorization  included in the administrations budget request for formula and project grants to medical. dental. and health professions schools could  be appropriated for grants under the existing provision of law to assist medical and dental schools in serious financial straits to meet their costs of operation. i would direct my colleagues attention to the fact that the conference substitute further provides that the appropriations to meet the emergency assistance needs are authorized to remain available for an additional year to june 30. 1972. this authority is most important for it will permit added flexibility in utilizing the additional funds appropriated for emergency aid to medical and dental schools. it just does  make sense to have the sources of the best. the newest. and the safest in health care and treatmentthe medical and dental schools and their teaching hospitals and dental clinicsinstitutions traditionally committed to standards of excellence in the care of the sick. in the training of new physicians. dentists and other health professionals. and in the expansion of medical kledgeon the brink of financial disaster. the statement of managers urges "the administration to give serious consideration to the needs of these institutions. with a view to requesting such sums as may be necessary to provide the emergency assistance which the schools require." the extent of the crisis was described in a newspaper report by frederick p. mcgehan and a upi news feature by louis cassels and i ask unanimous consent that the articles entitled "some medical schools facing closure" and "crisis in medical schools may worsen doctor shortage" be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. other important provisions which were in my veterans in allied health professions and occupations act of 1970 and in the senatepassed bill and for which the house had corresponding provision were student assistance programs. authorizations to encourage a talent search for allied health professions personnel. and the requirement for a licensure report by the secretary of health. education. and welfare. all of these were accepted by the house with only mi reductions in authorizations. the provision for student aid and a talent search were essential. they permit us to take an important first step forward and utilize in our civilianhealth industry the more than 30.000 medical corpsmen who leave the military service each year. the bill is designed to bring veterans and others with background and interest into the civilian medical service where they are desperately needed and to explore the possibility of finding new sources of manpower capable of performing many of the functions  carried out by highly skilled and scarce professional personnel. what better way to help many of the thousands of returning vietnam veterans find meaningful employment. surely. a medical corpsman who is qualified to treat the wounded on the battlefield should be soon qualified to assist in the treatment of patients in our hospitals wards and emergency rooms. the requirement for a licensure report will be invaluable in helping overcome critical manpower shortages. by conducting a comprehensive study of existing laws. regulations. customs. and practices governing the licensing. certification. or other means by which individuals are determined to be qualified to practice in the allied health professions. we can seek to prevent artificial and unnecessary restrictions on the entry and advancement of skilled personnel. this nation needs to make the best use of every available person in the health field. i urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report.
. in proposing that amendment. i ask the senator from new jersey to state whether he agrees with me in the following: we have. under this amendment. the concept of a statement which will help us better to enforce the law where a deviation from an existing national consensus standard is promulgated by the secretary. a national consensus standard. under this act. is a standard which has been developed by one of two organizations at the present time: the american national standards institute or the fire underwriters association. in the first place. this amendment ought to be adopted so that the people will have an explanation of why the secretary is doing what he is doing. the other aspect of the matter is that the bill provides for a national institute of occupational health and safety. and it is important to assure. these outside organizations. which are very important in this field. that the institute is  designed in any way to preempt or limit the activity or importance of national consensus organizations such as the american national standards institute. these organizations have made valuable contributions in this field in the past. and i hope they will continue to do so in the future. this is so that they may be reassured that the institute represents threat to them. the other point i should like to make with respect to reassuring these organizations is to confirm the fact that it is expected that the director of the new institute will take full advantage of the extensive expertise represented by members of technical societies and private standards development organizations which serve an important purpose and which should continue to function in the private sector of occupational health and safety.
. i am the ranking republican member of the alcoholism and narcotics subcommittee headed by the senator from iowa . i am very deeply interested  only in the particular section of the bill which relates to general education and higher education agencies. to wit. sections 2 and 3 and succeeding sections. but i am also very interested in section 4 relating to community education. we will soon be considering s. 3562 a bill which deals with the emous expenditure required for rehabilitation through a comprehensive federal program for the treatment of drug abuse and drug dependence. we all k the terribly difficult character of such an endeavor. to deal with narcotic addicts and the tremendous crime for which they are responsible. the rate of recidivism and the rate of cures once they become addicts. thus. the approach to the narcotic addiction and drug abuse problem is the educational approach.  only on the level of those who go to school but on all levels of the community in which these shocking conditions obtain. which are generally the slums and ghettos of our great cities. especially. unhappily for my state. the city of new york. so i am especially deeply concerned about the need for this bill. which i think is most constructive. and i deeply appreciate the concept of community oriented educational programs on drug abuse and dependency.  only for the addict. but for the benefit of interested and concerned parents. leaders in the community. and others who are affected and touched by the addiction. this bill covers all of that including support for the development of "peer group" leadership programs. i think it is a most admirable job. i hope it will soon become law. i would like to join the senator from nebraska in expressing appreciation for the leadership of senator hughes which has brought about this bill so that it is  before us. i might say i had a long collaboration with senator robert kennedy about this very matter. and i realized at that time. as did he. how critical it was to get senators who are in key positions to carry their share of the responsibility for bringing our ideas into legislation. the senator from iowa comes from a relatively rural state. and yet he has shown a most exemplary sensitivity and understanding of this problem. i believe were my former colleague. senator robert kennedy. on the floor with me. he would want to join me in the expression of that appreciation. i think it is most symbolic that his brother. senator edward kennedy. has taken a similar and burning interest in this particular problem. i would like to say to both senators how critically helpful it is to have men of such distinction espousing this cause with regard to a problem which is such a scourge to a community like the city of new york.
. and in view of its incidence in the regional medical program and the advanced character which it holds in the field of dealing with major diseases which are killers in the united states. we thought it was desirableand hope very much that the manager of the bill will agreethat a given sum. which we believe to be somewhat even less than is actually contemplated in the general appropriation which is set forth here. may be earmarked. so that those who are interestedand the national organizations here have done an extraordinary fine jobmay have some basic assurance as to the amount of the aggregate for regional medical programs which is required by the legislation to be utilized for this purpose. i should like to point out that the committee has made aher proviso with respect to research and demonstration on early care for suspected coronary patients. thus indicating that its mind is oriented to the desirability of earmarking in some highly desirable cases. inasmuch as this is a new program. in which many of us have joined. i hope very much that the committee may find it desirable in the same way for the amount that i have named. increase in the appropriation is sought or required. it is simply a question of making clear that we hope and expect that a given amount of it will be used for this highly desirable purpose.
i thank my colleague from washington very much. i repeat. the senator from washington and the senator from new hampshire are just as interested in this issue as i am. i k that all in the medical field will be verj much pleased to follow their lead.
s budget allocation was $118.3 million. the senate appropriations committee granted $114.6 million. we seek to restore that figure by adding approximately $4 million. to summarize. the main increases we seek are in headstart. in the manpower training programwhich includes the neighborhood youth corps for summer jobsand in the health and nutrition programs. the other increases are  relatively large in terms that i have just described to the senate but also very important. we do take the oeo basic authorization figure. that is. the appropriation for oeo. to the allowable appropriation after deducting the $50 million which already has been appropriated with respect to public school desegregation efforts. in looking at the overall picture i would like to give the senate a few facts. first. even if we take the administrations requests as they were cut by the committee on appropriations. and the cut from the administration request was  great. the following percentages would be reached in the target groups which each of these programs is designed to reach: with respect to family planning we would be reaching 8.9 percent of those who need assistance. in respect of drug addiction. we would be reaching 1.7 percent. in respect to alcoholics and recover from alcoholism we would be reaching 4.4 percent in respect of legal services we would be reaching 17 percent. in respect of even headstart. which is a very popular program. we would be reaching 31 percent. in short. we are  looking for any goldplated appropriation here. still. even with these authorized amounts we are appropriating. it would be far from the coverage we should have. also we should have in mind the number of poor in this country. in this affluent country there are 24.3 million poor. which is onehalf the population of great britain. i would like to point out that contrary to many popular misconceptlons. 69 percent of the poor are white and 31 percent are white. in short. this is  a race problem in that over twothirds of the poor today are white. i also would like to point out that the rural poor constitute onethird of the nations poor. that is a very significant figure because so often men who are voting here and exercising this great responsibility overlook the fact that we have a tremendous number of rural poor. for all those reasons. both in terms of the continuance of the present practice of the oeo. and in terms of the amount of increase we seek by this amendment. i deeply believe that it is well worthy of the support of the senate. before i conclude on this initial presentation i would like to repeat what i said this morning because i think it is critically important in this debate. i do  argue for this amendment in any adversary sense with the committee. i repeat what i said today and i want to repeat it as often as there may be any question about it. the senator from washington and the senator from new hampshire have as deep a concern as anyone for the poor. i have served on this committee and i k the colossal sums that must be appropriated for many purposes. including this one. and the problem of dividing what is available. if this revision is to be made in accordance with this amendment they have a right to say to the senate. "certainly. if you wish to do it this way do so. but we have done the best we can in committee. it is  up to all of the senate to do what it feels is the right thing to do in this situation." so i hope senators will  feel that they are reversing anyone or that there is some squabble because that is  true. they have done the best they can and they have done it according to their consciences. the rest is up to us. this amendment is an appeal to the senate to do what a group of us think is the right and necessary thing to do in this situation.
please let me finish. i have the floor. and i did  interrupt the senator. i may say to the senator. also. that i think it is pretty rough to make these accusations against a committee of the senate which has just been given. within the last few months. a substantial sum of money to do a very material and major job on this subject. i am the ranking miity member of that committeethe senator from new jersey is.the chairman. but he is engaged in the conference on occupational health and safetywhich is actually doing this job in order to give us the basis to legislate. all we have from the senator from indiana is the general statement that many studies have been made. will the senator  get to worki will be happy to sit. down and listen to himand tell us exactly what the studies are. where they come from. and what they say.
. i would like to congratulate senator byrd and the. members of the subcommittee on deficiencies and supplementals. together with the whole appropriations committee for the addition of funds for certain drug abuse programs. .when i appeared before the subcommittee i asked for $3 million for grants and contracts for drug abuse education projects under public law 91513. the new comprehensive drug abuse prevention and- control act. i am happy to see that the committee has funded this request in full. i also asked for $20 million for grants for special projects for narcotic addicts and drug dependent persons under public law 91513. the committee funded $10 million for this program and while i would have liked to see the total appropriation. granted. i feel that this money will mark an important first step in providing critically needed special treatment and rehabilitation programs in the drug abuse area. . the committees actions in this area have shown -its. awareness of the drug problem which has so tragically affected americas young people and has indicated a national commitment to fund new inative prevention. -treatment. and rehabilitation programs to combat the drug abuse epidemic. i hope that this commitment on the part of all of us will be carried on in future appropriations measures. i should like to question the chairman of the subcommittee on one other matter. and that is the lawenforcement education program. i thought of the possibility of seeking an additional $10 million for this program. especially in respect of helping those who are engaged in law enforcement to get a higher level of education. such an appropriation. if made. would have to be contingent upon the authorization coming through. which i have doubt will come through. the need is so urgent and crime is so critical 6 problem that i would hope very much that if the amendment is proposed. the committee would be sympathetic. my interest in this matter was stirred by* word from the john jay college of criminal justice. in new york. which is part of the new york university complex and law school. which has a large program reaching approximately 5.000 students. they felt that the shortage of funds was directly harmful to policemen and others who are basically parttime students seeking to improve their education and training in the field of law enforcement. i would  be inclined to submit any amendment unless the chairman of the committee and the ranking miity member showed some interest in it at this time. it would have to be contingent upon authorization. if they did . i would simply wait until the authorization came through. in the hope that an additional appropriation could be passed early egh in january to benefit students in the spring semester. it really it is a collaborative thing. and i would greatly appreciate the views of the senators on it.
. last night the conference committee on the occupational health and safety act of 1970 completed its work at a very late hour. it was a very difficult conference. this bill represents one of the most significant pieces of labor legislation to be considered by congress in many years. the result of the conference committees diligent workand i am the ranking member of that committee and the subcommittee in handling the matterduring the past week is a most equitable bill. designed to assure as far as possible health and safety in the workplace. yet at the same time to guarantee fair treatment for both the employees and the employers of this country. i am pleased to annce that i have received a letter from secretary of labor.hodgson expressing the administrations full agreement with the conference report. and i am hopeful that this expression of support will do much to insure enactment of the bill into law this year. i ask unanimous consent that secretary hodgsons letter be printed in the record.
subsequently said: . as to their effect and if there is illness. the payments are made directly to the providers of the medical services the alleged inequities which would result. for an illness incurred by the family. i shall discuss these in detail at an ap- aher issue was raised by senator wilpropriate time. but i did feel that at the liams on page 20807 where he stated that "in earliest moment they should stand in new york. a welfare family will collect a the record. so that anyone who wishes higher premium on family splitting. they may read these replies. collect $2508 more as two families than if so i ask unanimous consent that the they live as one family. they can collect that letter of the department of health. edu- every year under this bill. if they will just separatethe husband taking part of the cation. and welfare. signed by the hon- children. and the wife taking the other orable john g. veneman. under secre- children." tary. be printed in the record. this is highly distorted.. in this respect the
. the passage on december 19 of the comprehensive alcoholic abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act of 1970 marks the culmination of a campaign senator moss. of utah. myself. and others both in the congress and out. have been waging since 1966 to bring about recognition of alcoholism as an illness and the establishment of a national committee to meet the challenge of this major health problemalcoholismon all fronts. that was the aim of the javitsmoss alcoholism care and control act of 1969 introduced prior to the formation of the special subcommittee chaired by senator hughes of which i am the ranking member. a bill which had the backing of 42 senators from both parties and the active support of the th american association of alcoholism programs and the national council on alcoholism. in substantial measure this bill was incorporated into the comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment and rehabilitation act of 1970 and other provisions of the javitsmoss bill were enacted into public law 91211. the passage on december 19 of the comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act of 1970 bears out my prophecy as the leadoff witness on july 23. 1969. on the impact of alcoholism before the special subcommittee on alcoholism and narcotics. i said at that time that the organization of this subcommittee "is a significant stroke by our chairman. senator yarborough and i join in its work most enthusiastically as the ranking member of the senate labor and public welfare committee. i look forward to constructive meaningful results from our hearings. i. too. join with senator yarborough in the feeling that senator hughes. new to us. but a great gover in his own right. will give us the energy and the leadership which the consummation of this total effort requires. i am very optimisfic about our ability to succeed." i am grateful for the kind words of senator hughes about. my efforts regarding this legislation and wish all to k that without his dedication and able leadership this vital legislative commitment could  have been achieved. the differences between the housepassed bill and the bill as it passed the senate have been thoroughly discussed by senator hughes when the senate passed the modified house form of the bill and i concur in his remarks. i too am concerned that the findings. particularly the provisions stating that alcoholism is an illness or disease and strengthening present findings to more clearly indicate that the criminal law is  an appropriate vehicle for preventing or controlling a health problem. which alcoholism is. have been dropped in the bill. although these findings have been deleted. the thrust of this landmark legislation. to establish comprehensive programs to treat alcoholics throughout the country with the aid of federal funding. has been accomplished. as the author of the formula grants provision. i am gratified to e that the modified house version of the bill increased the authorization for formula grants over the next 3 years from $75 to $180 million. this is vital if we are to help state governments develop and administer programs dealing with alcoholismalthough i regret reducing the funding for alcoholism prevention and treatment project grants. i believe the passage of this legislation represents a practical and historic federal commitment to meet the challenge of alcoholism.
i have other questions and other matters which i shall touch upon on my own time. i think what the senator has done is critically important. because we in the labor and public welfare committeeand i am the ranking republican member on the committeek that matter what we would do in the way of expanding medical schools. and the per capita cost is unbelievable. the real problem we have to ccpe with is the shortage of doctors. and the maldistribution of the doctors. i am glad the appropriations committee has worked on it. the cooperation between the committees could  be better. but i think we  only have to think about shortening the time it takes to become a physician. as the senator from washington has said. but also about providing assistants to physicians. senators may be aware of the felsher system in the soviet union. which utilizes paraprofessionals to provide health care. we may as well be frank here in the united states. we all admire our doctors and respect medicine as a profession. but i do  think they understand the real spirit of the antitrust laws. i say that euphemistically. but it is true. what we are trying to do is have the cooperation of the medical profession to develop physician assistants and otherwise relieve the problem of physician shortage and maldistribution. ody is talking about defying the medical profession or being antagonistic to physicians. but the medical manpower shortage is so real and so great that we are going to have to find someway to make the decision to overcome the problem rather than look to them to make it. also. we are going to have to provide some condition to those receiving federal financial assistance to become health professionals that they will serve the nation in certain areas. for a given period of time. where it is required in the national interest. i do  see any reason why. when we make it possible with a federal scholarship or loan to help a person become educated to be a doctor. and he accepts that assistance voluntarily. we can ask that young man or woman to give a certain number of years of service. in a given place. for a given time. it seems to me we are going to have to realistically face this problem.
. reserving the right to object. i want to ask the senator a couple of questions. i have been consulted by the senator. i am the acting ranking member of this committee because of the very sad illness of the senator from south dakota . and i have been consulted by the senator regarding this matter. i shall  delay action on it. but i did want to ask two questions for the record. one. is it assumed that this resolution will mean. aside from the continuance of the work of the committee. any change in existing law respecting whether there is any authority to extend the work. in view of the fact that we will have a new congress.
 broad power to deal with paralyzirfg strikes and lockouts which threaten national or regional health and safety. i believe early hearings will be scheduled by the committee on labor and public welfare on emergency dispute legislation.. including this bill -and the administration proposal. i say this after consultation with the chairman of the committee. this .is a very urgent matter. our country has. been very lucky in recent years  to have been plunged into a very. profound crisis because of the absence of such legislation. for example. if we faced a railroad strike and a determined miity took it into its mind to prevent action upon an ad hoc bill. then a strike might occur. in which event the secretary. of transportation predicts chaos in any effort to work out with the unions a means for moving whatever is essential to the .national health and safety. the unions might disagree. but we never k until we get into it. that is one of a dozen examples involving transportation. and other basic industries. which could produce grave national. emergencies: so we have been lucky. but our luck can hold out forever. it is critically important that this matter be dealt with. yesterday the senator from michigan
. my purpose in obtaining the floor today is to introduce two bills. the national health insurance and health services improvement act of 1971. which i send to the desk for appropriate reference. and the local comprehensive health service systems act of 1971. which i send to the desk for appropriate reference.
s message on health will be here today. it proposes the administrations alternative respecting this particular matter. in which i hope very much to have a material part. in bringing about the development and implementation of the final system. the secretary of health. education. and welfare. under my second bill. would be authorized to make grants to public or profit hospitals. medical schools. insurance carriers. or profit prepayment plans or profit community groups. up to 80 percent of the cost of planning and developing of comprehensive health care systems. in addition. he would be authorized to underwrite the operating and maintenance costs of such local systems for their first 5 years in order to enable them to get on their feet. this is an absolutely indispensable element of any national health insurance scheme. for without it. any scheme would be valueless. as we would  haveand we do  have todaythe means to bring it into being. these two bills would be in addition to other measures dealing with health education. as our medical schools urgently need considerable assistance. i will  trace the history of that. but at one time i was able to hav6 adopted in the senate an amendment to provide $100 million emergency financial assistance for medical schools. we are working out other means for helping them. but it is essential to recognize that they need help and need help urgently. the secretary of health. education. and. welfare would be mandated to undertake a comprehensive study of compensation methodologies for providers of services. soliciting the widest possible expression of views from interefted personsand organizations. including health insurance barriers. he would then present a lroposed regulation. nb later tihn december 1. 1973. regarding modification of methods of c6mpensation. ... i also propose to require the secretary. t study methods .6f c6mpensation designed to encourage responsibility -by medical. associations. which are largely regional ii ciaracter. in regard to this: question of methodology. of compensation. and the rationalization for how services should be provided to improvethrough peer review and otherwisethe quality of health care. "reasonable" charges as presently called for by title xviii would be modified to provide that wherever that phrase appears. it would .be subject to the modification. "appropriate." this modification would provide the secretary of health. education. and welfare with the necessary authority to restructure health care costs so that the charges will be for what the service is really worth when efficiently delivered. the secretary of health. education. and welfare would be authorized to require physicians providing services under this bill to meet standards of continuing professional education. of national minimum standards of licensure. if licensed after such standards are promulgated. and of certain professional specialty board standards of qualification for the performance of major surgery or other specialty services. to the extent practicable and consistent with good medical practice. the secretary of health. education. and welfare would encourage the training and employment of allied health personnel and other subprofessionals in the rendering of comprehensive health services. i have long urged bringing many of the 30.000 medical corpsmen released from ithe armed forces each year into the business of providing health services in an important way. the secretary of health. education. and welfare would be authorized to make loans and grants and to provide technical assistance to contracting comprehensive health service systems to help them develop the capability to administer the program. these systems would include such comprehensive health services as can be established with federal aid in given communities which do  have them . the secretary of health. education. and welfare would be authorized to establish. as a contingency provision. a national health insurance corporation. or corporations. the establishment of an autoous government corporation in a given area would be for the purpose of fostering -better organization of health care and reshaping financing mechanisms to facilitate progressive health care changes. from a practical standpoint. i believe a national health insurance program is far more likely. to emerge from congress if we utilize the existing health insurance industry. however. should heaings on national health insurance legislation indicate that the health insurance industry is  prepared to cooperdte: then iwould consider bypassing the carriers with the alteinative of the establishment of an autoous federal corporation or corporations tfi administer the program.. as authorized by. title x. of the bill..
subsequently said: since he introduction today of my national iealth insurance act and health servces systems act. i am pleased that the .residents omnibus health message has been made public. included in the presidents recommendations to achieve a comprehensive national health program are many provisions similar to those in the bills i have introduced today. i believe we in the 92d congress have  marked the beginning of the end of a journey toward the fulfillment of one of the great social needs of our peopleequal right to quality health care. i am pleased that the president believes that we should  destroy our present private sector health insurance system. but improve it. for this is extremely important in the scheme of my billsthe concept of reliance upon the management talents. expertise. and experience of the health insurance industry to make a national health system work. essential to the strategy of my bills is the concept of establishing a commitment to provide federal financial assistance. through grants and loans. to stimulate and develop comprehensive health service systems. such comprehensive health service systems have a variety of forms and names and the president has applied the name hmoshealth maintenance organizations. i am deeply gratified that the president has recommended a program of grants and loans to help these hmos start up and develop. aher presidential recommendation similar to what i have proposed today is the consolidation of the financing oj part a of medicare. which pays for hospital care. and part b. which pays fo] outpatient service and the elimination o: the monthly fee. this is done also by m3 bill.
 to proclaim the period of april 18 through april 25. 1971. as occupational health nurses week. this period will coincide with the annual joint meeting of the american association of industrial nurses and the industrial medical association. kn as the american industrial health conference. this years meeting will be of particular significance in light of the recent passage of the occupational safety and health act of 1970. a landmark bill which will be of direct and immediate benefit to the bulk of our nations 80 million workers. the senator from new jersey
. the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city. through its department of community medicine. has developed a unique program to improve environmental health and safety in east harlem. new york. which i commend to the attention of the senate. the east harlem environmental extension service. inc.. is a coalition of neighborhood housing groups. property owners. tenants. and job training groups. who have joined to promote both the program and the idea of urban extension agents whose work would be similar to that done by the nations agricultural extension agents. who have done such a remarkably effective job for so many years. in order that senators will be able to study this program. in greater detail. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the press release of mount sinai. describing the program and the cooperation of public and private agencies in its development. a list of the committee on training and standards. which indicates the remarkable support this program has developed. and letters from the federation of lower and middle income property owners and from union representatives which show their support and indicate the farsighted attitude of the service in providing career opportunity and mobility.
. on february 11. the distinguished majority leader and miity leader. senator mansfield and senator scott. were hosts at a luncheon in ho of the members of the national panel of consultants on the conquest of cancer. remarks of the members of the cancer panel made at that luncheon highlight their extensive and thorough report presented to the senate labor and public welfare committee. the unanimous conclusion of the reportthat the conquest of cancer is a realistic goal if an effective national program is initiated and pursuedserves as the basis of the bill. s. 34. that i introduced with the senator from massachusetts and is cosponsored by more than 40 members of the senate. i commend to the -attention of senators the transcript of the remarks made at that luncheon and ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. i am also pleased to invite the attention of senators to hearings on this bill that are scheduled by the health subcommittee of the senate labor and pubjic welfare committee. of whichi am the ranking miity member. on march 9 -and 10.. in response -to questions concerning the feasibility of an independent agency. called for by the reportand the legislation. i should like to quote the comments of  of the national panel of consultants on the conquest of cancer. he said: you will hear the criticism made that the analogy to the splitting of -the atom or the space program (where independent agencies were given the job) is  valid because we do  have the basic scientific kledge in cancer that we had in those fields. and therefore this program is  a program of engineering implementation of existing kledge as those programs were. i assure you that the panel was thoroughly aware of this distinction in making its recommendations. and we took it into full account. the valid analogy is  the scientific analogy but the organizational analogy. the cancer program. in order to succeed. needs the same independence in management. planning. budget presentation. and -the assessment of progress that those programs needed. and in those respects the independent authority analogy is a valid one. i regret that the extemporaneous remarks supporting s. 34 by other distinguished members of the panel. mrs. anna rosenberg hoffman. mr. emerson foote. and mr. laurance rockefeller. are  available.
in the presidents message outlining a comprehensive health policy for the 1970s. the president highlighted this administrations commitment to mount a special initiative to deal with sickle cell anemiaan inherited blood disease found almost exclusively in negroes or individuals with negroid heritage. recently wcbstv in new york featured an editorial on this dreadful neglected disease and the need for black and white americans together to work together to eliminate sickle cell anemia. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the wcbstv editorial of february 14. 1971. entitled "the neglected disease."
. this nati6n faces a deepening crisis in the provision of health and medical care for all its people. our resources for meeting increasing demands for medical services are  keeping pace with requirements for health manpower. this nation must have larger numbers of the right kind of health manpower personnel. located in the right places. and utilized in the right way. to give health services to the people who need them. to put the federal government in the forefront of efforts to meet these needs for health personnel. i am introducing for myself and senators baer.
s recommendations relating to health manpower training. the health manpower assistance act of 1971 provides: first. capitation grant authority to pay $6.000 per graduate to schools of medicine. dentistry. or osteopathy. this authority would be in lieu of existing formula grant authority under which appropriated funds are divided among the above schools. plus schcols of optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. and veterinary medicine. on the basis of relative enrollments and numbers of graduates. capitation grants for graduates only would give the schools an incentive to increase their output rather than just expanding firstyear enrollments. the grants would encourage the schools to shorten their curricula. promote advanced placement. and replace students lost through attrition. an almost threefold increase in the dollar amount of formula aid currently provided would establish a base of federal support which would give financial viability to most of the schools assisted. i believe that our nations schools of optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. and veterinary medicine also make an invaluable contribution to our nations health and capitation grant authorityat perhaps a lesser amountshould be provided to such schools for their institutional support.  provided in the bill. second. separate special project grant authorities for schools of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry. and for schools of optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. and veterinary medicine. instead of a single combined authority as under existing law. existing purposes of grants would be continued. in the case of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry. new authority would be provided to aid students in securing a part of their education under a preceptor in family practice. pediatrics. internal medicine. or other fields designated by the secretary. both of the new authorities would add specific provision for grants to increase educational opportunities for disadvantaged students and to improve the geographic or specialty group distribution of such health manpower. third. there would be separate special project authority for aid to alleviate financial distress of schools of medicine. osteopathy. dentistry. optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. and veterinary medicine. under certain conditions as to disclosure of financial information and implementation of operational and financial reforms. while the proposed capitation grants to schools of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry would help many of those schools get on a sound financial basis. this separate authority would allow the federal government to devote a portion of its resources to a direct effort to solve the exceptional financial problems of health professions schools. fourth. health manpower education initiative awards would permit the federal government to attack special health manpower problems through support of projects to improve the supply. distribution. utilization. and efficiency of health personnel. the new authority would allow targeted aid without regard to categorical restraints for the establishment of area health education centers. consortia. and other cooperative arrangements among institutionsboth educational and servicefor the training of needed manpower. it would permit the development of programs to train staff for health maintenance organizations. to provide team training of physicians and allied health personnel. and otherwise to relate health manpower education more directly to the delivery of health services. with particular emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches. fifth. new consolidated construction assistance authority would be in lieu of five separate authorities in existing law for the construction of: health professions teaching facilities. nurse training facilities. allied health training facilities. medical research facilities. and medical library facilities. this authority would provide more flexible assistance for construction of teaching facilities. advanced or continuing education facilities. medical library facilities. and health research facilities. among eligible applicants would be schools of medicine. osteopathy. dentistry. optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. veterinary medicine. public health. nursing. and allied health. including their affiliated hospitals. and other agencies. organizations. institutions. or combinations thereof. grants could be made in an amount up to 67 percent of total costs. new provisions for guaranteed loans and interest subsidies would help private profit schools tap private resources for the financing of construction. i would emphasize that it is my understanding that the purpose of this guaranteed loan and interest subsidy provision is to supplement the existing grant program.  to supplant it. in the face of hundreds of millions of approved but unfunded grant applications. i believe we can longer rely solely upon the grant mechanism to meet our schools needs but must take this inative step of guaranteed loans and interest subsidies to overcome the substantial unmet needs. sixth. student aid provisions would make significant changes in existing scholarship and loan programs to help disadvantaged students. and would be coupled with incentives to improve distribution of manpower. health professions scholarship aid would be targeted toward lowincome disadvantaged students in schools of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry. with the maximum amount of assistance for a student increased from $2.500 to $3.000 a year. scholarship grants would be distributed among schools of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry on the basis of the number of lowincome. disadvantaged students enrolled at those institutions. schools of optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. or veterinary medicine would receive grants upon the secretarys determination that such grants would help fill a national need for practitioners in these professions. in the case of loans for health professions students. provision would be made for increased reliance on the office of educations guaranteed loan program. the authority for this program would be amended to allow loans up to $5.000 a year for students of medicine. osteopathy. dentistry. optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. and veterinary medicine. to extend the repayment period for these students. and to make a new provision for forgiveness of loans made to graduates who practice in a shortage area and to lowincome students who fail to graduate. the new provision for forgiveness of loans for graduates who practice in a shortage area would be one important step toward improving the distribution of health personnel in our nation. however. i am concerned that there is provision for direct student loans. i am  convinced that reliance solely upon a guaranteed loan program will provide the necessary assistance our students require. seventh. a separate 3year authorization of such sums as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act. i am confident that  only wil specific authorization levels of funding be provided before this measure is reported out to the senate but also. that rather than a single authorization for all purposes of the act. the committee will seek to establish separate authorizations for the various purposes herein contemplated. although existing statutory health manpower advisory councils are"abolished by this legislation. i am assured that administrative action will be taken to establish such advisory councils as are appropriate. although this bill does recognize that the health of the nation depends in large measure on the availability and quality of nursing services and has many inative provisions to meet the critical nurse shortage. i am concerned that its provisions do  provide a sufficiently balanced program of support to nursing schools and nursing students. i therefore intend to introduce a national nursing education act to achieve such objectives. the health manpower assistance act of 1971 would make possible an expanded federal health manpower training program designed to produce the manpower resources essential to achieving national health care objectives. and i am confident this bill will receive the most serious consideration in forthcoming attempts to determine how best to extend and strengthen federal programs of aid for training of health personnel. we must move toward early enactment of legislation to provide the health manpower required to meet national needs for health and medical care. exhibrr 1
. i reintroduce a resolution that would result in the creation of a battle monument hoing the "lost battalion" of world war i. the septemberember 1918 meuseargonne campaign constituted the greatest battle in american history up to that time. more than 1.200.000 americans took part in this 47day campaign along a front that extended from southeast of verdun at the argonne forest. out of this battle section emerged the legend of the "lost battalion." for 5 days. a valiant detachment of american soldiers. under constant enemy fire and lacking food. water. and medical supplies. held fast even though completely surrounded by german forces. on october 2. 1918. maj. gen. robert alexander. commander of the 77th division. ordered the understrength 1st and 2d battalions of 308th infantry regiment to the attack. maj. charles whittlesey. commanding the 1st battalion. led the assault. the offensive of which this attack was a part failed everywhere. but major whittlesey and his men reached a ravine just south of their objective. thus began the legend of the "lost battalion." cut off from the other u.s. forcessewed up in a pocket approximately 300 yards long and 60 yards widemajor whittleseys men dug into the thickets of the argonne forest to secure their positions. attempts made to reach the "lost battalion" were repulsed by the germans. by october 5. major whittlesey and his men were suffering severely. having been isolated for 3 nights and lacking sufficient food. water and medical supplies. and they were surrounded by a fresh german division. the mortars. machineguns. flamethrowers and rifles of which lashed at them relentlessly. on october 7. major whittlesey received a surrender message from his german counterpart. he sent reply. the germans launched a fierce attack with flamethrowers. and were repulsed. paralleling this action. a major american attack was launched. and the "lost battalion" was reached. the "lost 3attalion." in reality. consisted of the 1st battalion of the 308th regiment and elements of the 307th and the 306th machine gun company. it would have been lost to the enemy. save for the heroism and tenacity of the american fighting men involved. published figures vary. but of the 550 men sealed off in the pocket. one source lists 252 survivors. 107 dead. 190 wounded. and 63 missing. major whittlesey. captain mcmurty. and captain :holderman each received the congressional medal of ho and the survivors of the "lost battalion" volunteered to remain on the front line. the deeds of the men of the "lost battalion" constitute a legend and a symbol. equaling such other moments in american history as the alamo. when americans have done that which has been necessary regardless of the cost to themselves. it is only fitting. therefore. that the nation should ho the men of the "lost battalion" in like manner.
. i wish to say i may  be able to be here. either. i did  intend to block the bill. but to record the inadequacy of the provision for occupational health and safety administration. my purpose is remedying that in the regular supplemental bill which will come up soon.
. i am also grateful to the committee for beginning to make some provision for the administration of the occupational health and safety legislation which we passed last year. their action in appropriating $1.400.000 for this purpose will enable us to implement the law that much sooner.
. the subcommittee on health of the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. recently conducted a hearing at the thern westchester hospital in mount kisco. n.y.. as part of the subcommittees current round of hearings on health care in america. many witnesses from westchester countyrepresentative of health care and consumers of medical services. patientsappeared before the subcommittee to discuss the delivery of health care in a suburban setting. jerome f. peck. administrator of the thern westchester hospital. pointed out that the goal of his suburban hospital is the same as the goal of every hospital. namely: to provide quality medical care at an ecoically feasible cost. this goal. he said: can be achieved using conventional methods of hospital construction and hospital operation. he went on to describe for the subcommittee several construction and operation inations being undertaken at thern westchester hospital and i ask unanimous consent that the full text of mr. pecks statement be printed in the record.
. today. thanks to the painstaking research of medical scientists and the discovery of such chemotherapeutic agents such as ldopa. there is new hope and relief from suffering for more than 1.500.000 americans afflicted with parkinsons disease. in this effort. the parkinsons disease foundation has made a very special contribution- through a strong basic and applied research program and its training of physicians for work in this field. the foundation has also brought new insight and understanding about parkinsons and allied diseases through its programs of public education and information. i am pleased to serve as a member of the national sponsors committee of this foundation together with senators anderson. humphrey. tower. and tunneyas well as a number of distinguished members of the house of representatives. on the occasion of the foundations annual awards dinner. dr. julius axelrod 1970 el prize laureate. was cited for his able scientific contributions. dr. axelrod has been chief of pharmacology at the national institute of mental health since 1955. and has given the nation extraordinary leadership in our quest for a better understanding of human behavior and for new weapons to cure nervous and mental disorders. dr. h. houston merritt. who helped create the parkinsons disease foundation in 1957. was also hoed at the dinner for his share in the development of neurology in the nation and the world. the importance of this event was underscored by a proclamation issued by gov. nelson a. rockefeller who set april 28 as parkinsons disease day in new york state. the proclamation stated: parkinsonism. sometimes kn as parkinsons disease or "shaking palsy." is a crippling and little understood malady which affects more than 1.500.000 americans. most of whom are stricken after age 50. until recently. its victims faced years of suffering in which their productivity was progressively and significantly curtailed. . thanks to painstaking research and new chemotherapeutic agents forged by medical science. there is relief from suffering and new hope for its victims. surgery. drugs and exercise have helped to reduce the toll of parkinsonism and enabled many of the afflicted to lead useful and productive lives. the parkinsons disease foundation. affiliated with columbia university in new york city. was the nations first organization dedicated to finding the cause. prevention and cure of parkinsonism. through its programs of research. treatment. public and professional education. and financial support. the foundation has brought new insight and understanding of this terrible disease. on april twentyeighth. the foundation will mark its fourteenth year in the struggle to alleviate the human anguish caused by parkinsonism. . therefore. i. nelson a. rockefeller. gover of the state of new york. do hereby proclaim april 28. 1971. as parkinsons disease day in new york state. gover william cahill of new jersey also proclaimed the day and paid tribute to the parkinsons disease foundation for its unique contributions to "alleviate the anguish of parkinsons disease." the parkinsons disease foundation was established in 1957 and since has become a world center in the struggle against parkinsonism. william black. board chairman of the foundation. contributed $5.000.000 to columbia university toward construction of a new building to provide space for medical research. more than 600 medical research projects are currently being pursued in the 20story william black research building. in specialized laboratories occupying one floor of the building. 55 scientists and techogists work on a variety of approaches to parkinsonism. in addition. a special clinic for treating parkinsonism is held twice weekly at vanderbilt clinic. in 1964. the national institute of neurological diseases and blindness made a grant of $3.000.000 to columbia university to establish and maintain a parkinsons disease research and information center. this grant under the direction of dr. melvin yahr. has recently been renewed for an additional 5 years. it is matched by private funds from the parkinsons disease foundation. which is housed in the william black research building. the foundations research has been aided through the establishment of a brain bank 9 years ago. the foundations medical scientists have studied more than 100 brains willed to the foundation by former patients. the kledge gained from these studies has been helpful to other investigators over the years. the results of research conducted in the foundations laboratories are published in international medical journals and are regularly presented at worldwide scientific congresses. a large group of distinguished americans who serve as sponsors of the foundation include hon. william cahill. bennett cerf. hon. kenneth gibson. mrs. dwight d. eisenhower. andrew goodman. mrs. marjorie mazia guthrie. harold helm. conrad n. hilton. mrs. anna rosenberg hoffman. dr. george james. mrs. albert d. lasker. gustave l. levy. hon. john v. lindsay. dr. william j. mcgill. page morton. jerome k. ohrbach. peter roberts. hon. nelson a. rockefeller. julius rosenwald ii. and laurence tisch. other distinguished americans who serve as sponsors of this vital foundation are: hon. hale boggs. hon. emanuel celler. hon. james m. collins. mr. john charles daly. mr. and mrs. howard dietz. prof. sir john eccles. wilbur eubank. hon. daniel j. flood. miss arlene francis. hon. sanford garelik. hon. edward koch. george meany. dr. isidor i. rabi. hon. ogden r. reid. mrs. marc b. rojtman. dr. james shan. edward sulzberger. hon. lester l. wolff. our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the parkinsons disease foundation for its untiring efforts to improve the health of our people and to free those afflicted from the scourge of this disease.
. let me take 30 seconds to put into the record a complete analysis of the world opium situation and a brief summary relating to international cooperation to control the illegal heroin traffic pepared by the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs. department of justice. and submit it to the senate special committee on alcoholism and narcotics. december 2. 1970. and also the memorial of the new york state legislature to which i have referred. dated may 17. 1971.
. i commend to the attention of the senate a current opinion editorial by dr. ard lewis. director of the brooklyncumberland medical center. long island university medical services associates program. in the june 16. 1971. issue of medical tribune entitled "the medical services associate." i ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. the editorial describes a demonstration project to train medical service associatesmsajointly established by the brooklyncumberland medical center and long island university. the msas will be equipped to assist general practitioners or internists or surgeons. a number of trainees are recently discharged armed forces medical corpsmen and representation from the surrounding community is included in the selection committee. since both the medical center and the university are located in the fort greene bedfordstuyvesant ghetto of brooklyn. where both medical manpower and facilities are inadequate. the program -ims to upgrade the health care of the community and most candidates are chosen from the area. in hopes that they will remain after training.
ial office which will contain a comprehensive federal plan for utilizing all available prevention and treatment resources to combat the drug problem. describe existing model and experimental methods of treatment and rehabilitation implementation. and make recommendations for community implementation. a national institute on drug abuse and drug dependence. in the department of health. education. and welfare. to coordinate that agencys programs in the drug abuse and drug dependence area. a new grant program for assistance to state and local communities in the prevention and treatment area: first. a 3year $100 million emergency supplemental state assistance program for emergency supplemental funding to states to provide more effective prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs. second. a 3year $180 million model and experimental prevention. treatment. and research program. to conduct and evaluate prevention and treatment programs. finance communitybased programs providing a broad range of services. and conduct a special emphasis research program for chemical substances or techniques in the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and drug dependence. and third. an expanded community mental health centers drug treatment and rehabilitation program. treatment and other related rights for veterans by requiring the veterans administration to provide treatment and rehabilitation services to all veterans for drug abuse and drug dependence. and further require veterans discharged under conditions other than hoable as a result of drug abuse or drug dependence and successfully rehabilitated. be allowed to obtain a discharge of. hoable character. that the u.s. civil service commission establish drug abuse and drug dependence prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation programs for federal civilian employees. an independent national advisory council on drug abuse and drug dependence. to insure outside evaluation of federal efforts in this area. this legislation will provide an essential comprehensive framework to meet the narcotics plague which ravages our nation.
. i could  conclude my advocacy of this bill without referring to a man with whom i served in the armed forces of the united states 25 years ago -c. p. rhodes. then the director of the medical division ofthe chemical division of the army. c. p. rhodes came~to us from the presidency or the head or medical director of the sloan kettering institute. for years the leading and outstanding cancer research of a voluntary character in the united states. twentyfive years ago. c. p.. or "dusty." rhodes. as he was called in the army. preached this very doctrine. he said: there are so many hypotheses that we have to kk down in order to arrive at a final resolution of what may be the answer. that the faster we can kk them down.. the faster we will get the answer. we must always allow for that great scientist. that genius. sitting in his attic with chin in the palm of his hand. who will come up with the answer. but we can sentence millions to death while waiting for the answer. it may happen. if it does. that is fine. in the meantime. let us. accelerate this dreadful. painstaking process of kking down one more hypothesis as fast or faster until we get some answers. we are getting a good many answers  and that is what makes us feel- and we have this tremendous authority to back us upthat a massive offensive is justified and necessary. i deeply believe in it. the senator from colorado does. the senator from massachusetts
. the sena48059 0 - 72 - pt. 18 - 37 tor from colorado made the first point i was going to make. that we are  taking this out of nih. so far as humanly possible we are keeping it in nih and also making a massive specialized effort. that is the compromise and that is why the senator from colorado is with us and  against us. the senator asks what makes this better and why do we need it. we need it because the record of performance under the old scheme is inadequate. the panel found that to be so and they said on page 284. in the scientific section: but it also becomes clear that there has  been an organized national cancer control effort. carefully planned and centrally administered. this has led to unnecessary expenditures and duplication of effort in some areas. then. on page 3 in the summary of findings they said: a national program for the conquest of cancer is  essential if we are to exploit effectively the great opportunities which are presented as a result of recent advances in our kledge. however. such a program will require three major ingredients that are  present today: first. effective administration with clearly defined authority and responsibility. second. the development of a comprehensive national plan for a coherent and systematic attack on the vastly complex problems of cancer. such a plan would include  only programmatic research where that is appropriate. but also major segments of much more loosely coordinated research where plans can be definitively laid out  longrange objectives clearly specified. and third. the necessary financial resources. our performance up to  demands this new approach because it has been inadequate. to make it adequate this is what the panel recommends we do. and that is why we are doing it.
. it is a matter of the greatest interest to me that we can combine the utility of the public and private sectors in an intelligent way so that they will be of very great use and it will relieve the strain on the grant section of the bill. extend and increase the maximum level of student scholarships which is estimated to cost $40 million in fiscal year 1972and rising to $48 million in fiscal year 1976add a program of loan guarantees and have all student assistance programs include incentives for practice in medically underserved areas. it is particularly important at this time to have liberal forgiveness authority to encourage distribution by specialty. as well as geographic area. this is of particular importance to the improvement and distribution of health care. incentive capitation grant authorityin addition to other institutional support programs based on enrollmentwhich would pay $6.000 for each student of a school of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry for graduating under a 3year program. rather than the traditional 4 years or longer. a number of schools of medicine have inaugurated experimental programs to shorten the period of study for some of the students enrolled. other schools of medicine. as well as those of osteopathy and dentistry. are currently considering shortening the period of education of their students. the proposed provision will assure that for these inative programs. federal resources would be provided comparable to those provided for the longer period of training plus a $2.000 bonus intended as an additional incentive. the total institutional support authorization. based on capitation. is $426 million for fiscal year 1972 and rises to $516.5 million in fiscal year extend and broaden project grant authority to authorize health manpower initiative awards directed toward solution of critical health manpower problems. and several other programs aimed at bringing manpower to medically underserved areas. this program offers an emous opportunity for improving the numbers and distribution of health personnel and for relating health manpower more directly to changing patterns of health care. the authority is flexible so that efforts thereunder can be responsive to health manpower needs as they arise. these efforts can encourage experiments and breakthroughs which show particular promise of contributing to the solution of health manpower problems. including those in given geographic areas and those relating to new approaches to health care and health manpower training. $150 million for fiscal year 1972 is authorized with annual $15 million increments for 4 additional years. the rising expense of health professions education in recent years has placed an increasingly heavy financial burden on the students and their families. many highly motivated and qualified students have  been able to afford such training. to those ends the bill offers a variety of student assistance ranging from scholarships. through direct loans. to loan guarantees. the school and student together are in the best position to select the form and amount of assistance best suited to the students need. all students. regardless of ecoic background. are offered loan forgiveness if they practice in an underserved area. once a physician establishes a practice. he is  likely to move. a survey showed that 63 percent of physicians had  moved from the original practice or location. encouraging physicians to begin their practices in shortage areas could make real impact on improving the distribution of health care. encourage students with financial difficulty and from lowincome families to begin or continue their education by giving a priority for scholarship funds and offer forgiveness and cancellation of direct or guaranteed loans in the event they are forced to leave school.
. would the senator give the senate some comparison figuresi k what they are. but i think it would be useful to have them in the recordof american nationals studying in foreign medical schools as contrasted with foreign nationals studying in american medical schools.
. we will seek to supply the answer for the record. my recollection is that a very much larger number of americans are studying abroad. simply because of the crowded conditions. the very difficult competition for places in the u.s. medical schools. i introduced a similar measure in the 90th congress. and the senate passed the bill. but we lost it in conference. i think this is a useful addition to the measure. and i hope very much that senator kennedy might concur in that point.
. i hope the amendment is accepted because it represents the fruit of what we learned in the special committee on nutrition and human needs. preventive medicine is one of the most sought after and desirable programs we have in health care it is absolutely amazing to me. as it is to all who are kledgeable in the field. how little the concept of diet enters into the gaining of health. the keeping of health. and the regaining of health. for all of those reasons. and also for reasons directly related to poverty. because malnutrition comes from igance as well as absence of medical assistance in respect to nutrition. i hope the chairman will see fit to join with us in the amendment.
. for the past several years the department of health. education. and welfare has requested as part of its annual appropriation request the authority for advanced funding for student assistance programs under the health professions educational assistance act. the nurse training act. the allied health professions personnel training act. and the authorities for public health training under sections 306 and 309 of the public health service act. this advanced funding authority is necessary. because schools must k by april or may the funds that will be available for student assistance in september. as we all k. the appropriations are frequently  made available to the department of health. education. and welfare until after september. consequently. there is an urgent need to make funds available to the health manpower schools for student assistance early in the calendar year. s. 1183. that i introduced on behalf of the administration to extend the authorities for the training of health manpower. included a provision in section 17 that authorized advanced obligational authority for grants. loans. and other payments for health manpower training under titles 3. 7. and 8 of the public health service act. the amendment i propose today would make permanent the authority for the advanced funding of student assistance for the training of health manpower. the legislation is identical to the proposal to the department of health. education. and welfare under s. 1183. the amendment has the support of the american public health association. the association of schools of public health. the association of american medical colleges. the american nursing association. the american dental association. and the association of american dental schools. one of the disciplines to be affected by this amendment is the schools of public health. i ask unanimous consent that a document entitled "information on graduate schools of public health in u.s. universities." describing the important role played by these schools in the field of health manpower. be inserted in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
we have expressly dealt with that in the bill. there is provision for iristitutional support to schools of medicine. osteopathy. and dentistry to deal exactly with that subject. in addition. in aher bill going through the legislative mill. we are doing our utmost to develop a pilot plant operation to encourage schools to consider the .establishment of assistant doctors for a given specialty. that especially refers to medical corpsmen. because we believe today that such a man has the choice of being either a doctor or an orderly. and that does  lend dignity to an individual. we are trying to develop a system which would slot him into a position with more dignity as a result of the training he received in the armed forces merely as an orderly or as a doctor. we believe there is a potential in the 30.000 who are annually discharged from all our armed forces with training and experience in providing health care. so i can assure the senator that the senator from massachusetts and i. and all of our committee. are really deeply interested in that subject and are putting it into legislation.
there is some difficulty in getting an exact understanding of what the senator has in mind and i should like to ask him a few questions. by an individual physician plan. does the senator mean an individual physician has a roster of patients who are government employees and they subscribe to a plan to which the government makes certain contributions in terms of premiums.
. to the long list of frustrations emanating from our indochina disaster we must add the problem of drug abuse among our military personnel in vietnam. the defense department is only  beginning to recognize its responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of such persons. and the need to crackdown on those in south vietnam and laos allegedly even in government officials who are reaping the profits of the heroin trade. it is a most shocking. tragic. and disheartening development which underscores once again. the need for withdrawal from vietnam. as an appendix to his more lengthy testimony. professor zinberg supplied our subcommittees with a summary analysis of his interviews with vietnam veterans. he quotes extensively from the men themselves. i believe this analysis will be of interest to the senate and ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the record.
s health message he highlighted this administrations commitment to mount a special initiative to deal with sickle cell anemia. but i believe more must be done. sickle cell anemia. an inherited blood disease has by neglect become a national disgrace. it is a painful. crippling. blood disease that kills one out of every 500 black people in this country. two million other black americans carry the sickle cell trait today and yet there is program to stop it from being passed to the next generation. it is clear that we urgently need concentrated research into the causes and treatment of the disease. the carriers of the disease must be located and identified. there is greater tragedy than that of a young person who from birth is unable to fulfill the promise of his life. i ask unanimous consent that an article entitled "sickle cell anemia and its effect on black people." by dick campbell. executive director of the foundation for research and education in sickle cell disease. be printed in the record.
i appreciate. having lived through what the senator from new hampshire has lived through much longer than i had when i was on the appropriations committee. what he has to go through. at the same time i k the tenacity with which the senator has fought for what he believes to be right. i would like to take a minute to join the senator from massachusets in assurances to the senator from new hampshire and the senator from washington. king how deeply i am involved in these health matters. there are few more rewarding programs going to oppressed people or to depressed people than those with respect to which the senator is moving. i have other amendment to offer. rather than take the time of the senate. i join the senator from massachusetts in these amendments. and i assure the senator that in conference he will have a very strong case in respect to these matters.
. alcoholism has a disastrous impact on our society. there are 9 million alcoholics and the disease  affects directly or indirectly 36 million americans. regrettably. it is the fourth leading cause of death in this country. the gap between need and services has been recognized by gover rockefeller and he has annced a statewide conference to focus attention on the seriousness of the alcoholism problem. in conservative ecoic terms. the direct annual cost of the alcoholic public health problem is estimated at $15 billion and in human terms. the personal tragedy is immeasurable. among the tragic statistics of alcoholism are: nearly 2 million arrests are made each year for public drunkenness. accounting for about 40 percent of all traffic related arrests. about 50.000 people age 15 and older are killed each year on highways. of which more than half have alcohol in their blood at the time of the accident and 20.000 have alcohol concentrations in their blood which substantially exceed that produced by usual social drinking. aher 2 million people are disabled as a result of highway crashes of which at least 500.000 disabling injuries directly involve alcoholic problems. approximately onethird7.300--of all homicides are alcohol related. and alcoholism is the stated cause of death annually on 11.000 death certificates. new york state. like much of the nation. suffers from the emous personal. social. and ecoic cost of alcoholism. in new york city. alcoholism accounts for approximately onethird of the citys municipal hospital patients and for an even larger number of patients in mental and tuberculosis institutions. i commend gover rockefellers action and bring it to the attention of my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that a new york times article of august 1. 1971. by john darnton entitled "gover annces a full conference on alcoholism" be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. i believe that the convening of a statewide conference by gover rockefeller. which will include representatives from business. labor. major civic groups. and state agencies involved with the problem of alcoholism. can serve as a model to all states. i believe the concept of statewide alcoholism conferences merits the attention of all state governments.
does the senator  think the record should be very clear. to carry out what the senator has told us just . that we understand that the department may include in the rules and regulations orders of general applicability. which are the subject of section 602 (a). also a rule "where sex is a bona fide ground for such differential treatment". then. if anyone complains that that is being abused. there is considerable case law on the subject. and the matter can be contested. but at least it would take care. in a generic way. of the kind of question the senator from colorado has raised. that question is important. for example. it may be that a school does give a doctor of divinity a degree. it may give many other degrees. it could get help from the federal government in connection with a degree of doctor of divinity. but it might get help with mathematics. physics. astroy. or many other things. so it would seem to me to be a useful precaution that the legislative history should declare that when we give the secretary authority to make rules. regulations. or orders of general applicability which may deal with the kind of situation the senator from colorado is describing. he may deal with it under the discretionary rulemaking power. provided it is consistent with the objectives of the law.
. in these days when government in general and regulatory agencies in particular are attacked in some quarters as unresponsive to citizen interest and demand. it is refreshing to read what one of our nations leading medical publications has to say about dr. charles c. edwards. the head of one of our hardest working and underrated consumer protection agencies. the food and drug administration. an editorial published in medical tribune for september 8. 1971. closes by saying about fda commissioner charles c. edwards: . dr. edwards has been a good. indeed an outstanding commissioner. if he successfully provides the answers to the questions he posed. he may well be a great one. i ask unanimous consent that the editorial. entitled "goodand outstanding." be printed in the record.
. on september 20. 1971. before the house subcommittee on public health and environment. the members of the national panel of consultants on the conquest of cancer presented testimony on s. 1828. the conquest of cancer act and related legislation. proposing the establishment of a federal agency responsible for leading the attack against cancer. the senate. in a record vote of 79 to 1. favorably passed s. 1828. however concern has been expressed by some members of the scientific community about the organizational structure of the agency created by the senatepassed bill. i believe the testimony of these outstanding cancer research scientists and their distinguished lay colleagues answers the questions that have been raised and should allay the concerns that many of us have heard expressed. as benschmidt. chairman of the national panel of consultants on the conquest of cancer. testified: as this committee ks. our panel recommended an independent cancer authority. we reached that recommendation after much consideration only because we thought it was necessary to get the job done. one who ks anything about either organization or government would seek other than for the most compelling reasons to create a new and independent authority. but to get the changes in organization that were needed and to get the changes in philosophy that were needed. we felt that an independent authority was necessary if we were going to carry out the congressional mandate of making cancer a "national crusade." opposition to an independent agencyproposed i: s. 34. the bill i introduced with the senator from massachusetts
. in adopting an amendment with respect to american schools and hospitals. which cut the amount in half. i feel. and the senator from vermont agreesit was his amendment--that the intention was that there should be a fair distribution based on merit of whatever was ultimately appropriated among all the schools and hospitals listed in the senate committee report and the house committee report. or others they might add. and all the money should  be used for the first chosen schools and hospitals of the state department. to carry out that intention. i have a letter from john a. hannah. of the agency for international development of the state department. dated october 29. 1971. which confirms that.
. senator hughes has been an outstanding leader in this effort. i feel the time has come to give effective recognition to the fact that we have cure. and we have to find some way of taking these people off the backs of the public in terms of crime. this is a way to do it s. 2840 a bill to amend the public health service act so as to authorize emergency assistance for states and profit private agencies in the establishment of centers for maintenance. treatment. and rehabilitation of drug addicts be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that the public health service act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new title:
. i have long advocated the utilization of the more than 30.000 medical corpsmen returning each year. veterans with training in military medical service. as a vital adjunct to americas health personnel.  marked by severe shortages. i authored the veterans in allied health professions and occupations act of 1969 in the 91st congress. and was pleased to see it enacted as a part of the health training improvement actpublic law 91519. this year i played an important role in the comprehensive health manpower training act of 1971. which includes among its many important provisions. authorization for capitation grants of $1.000 to medical schools for each student enrolled in a program for the training of physicians assistants. i believe there is aher vast reservoir of health manpower which should be utilized as physicians assistants. these are our nurses. the often unsung heroes of health care. i am convinced that registered nurses with clinical experience. after an additional period of comprehensive training. can be even more valuable assistants to attending physicians as physicians assistants. one such program which i commend to the attention of senators was reported in the highland hilites. the news magazine of the highland hospital. of rochester. n.y. i ask unanimous consent that the article entitled "experiences of highlands first physicians assistant" be printed in the record.
. s. 2097. the drug abuse office and treatment act of 1971. reported today by the government operations committee. responds to an undeniable. longstanding failure in government organization and operationresulting in a crippled and ineffectual response to the critical national drug abuse problem. drug abuse research. treatment. education. and prevention will all benefit in that important treatment modalities of all kinds. including methadone maintenance. will be considered and evaluated centrally. the bill as reported. represents a major. bipartisan compromise reached after extensive negotiations over a period of many weeks between the white house. the attorney general and senators ribi-
. i strongly support senate joint resolution 75. a bill that would create a "national advisory commission on health science and society" to conduct a study of the ethical. social. and legal implications of advances in biomedical research and techogy. our rapid advances in the fields of biology and medicine have left us with some serious questions. while these advances serve to benefit mankind. their subsequent implications. for man and society. must be carefully studied. there are many efforts taking place in the medical field that leave open the question of how far we can or should go. we are acquiring the capacity to modify and perhaps even control human behavior. in the field of genetics. there have been many advances but also many questions. what are the implications when we fertilize an egg in the laboratoryand possibly implant that egg into a human being. in the field of organ transplants and the use of artificial organs. new questions have been posed which our lawsand even ethicsare  equipped to deal with. significant questions have been raised regarding the prolongation of life and the definition of death and with the advent of new techogies we have further increased the complexity and have expanded instances in which these decisions have to be made. i ask by whom and under what circumstances. we are  at a point where we need to look toward new solutions if we are ever to be able to cope with the problems that present and future advances in our techogy will bring. it is significant that the members of this commission would be drawn from many different fields. this would insure a final study that would be the result of various and divergent thoughts and beliefs. and one interest would be represented. the membership of the commission would be drawn from the general public. and from individuals in the fields of medicine. law. theology. biological science. physical science. social science. philosophy. humanity. health administration. government. and public affairs. as our society and world progress. we must ask ourselves more and more questions about the nature of human life. the study provided by the commission authorized under this bill should help us to deal with these increasingly difficult and complex questions. for which we must find answers if civilization is truly to progress on all fronts.
i thank the senator from illis very much. . we have a table showing exactly how many addicts we expect to treat. and what the costs would be for the treatment. [dollars in millions] number of addicts in year treatment total cost 1972 ----------------------- 60.000 $156 1973 ----------------------- 90.000 236 1974 ................ ...... 120.000 315 1975 ........................ 180.000 473 1976 ----------..----------.. 250.000 657 in my judgment it is one of the finest and most scientific jobs ever done in presenting an authorization to the congress. it shows a respect for the senate which is very hard to duplicate. these authorizations are very soundly shaped. we will have a right to fight for every dollar of appropriation money because they are really based on criteria which deserve respect and deserve to be followed. for all of these reasons. i consider this bill to be a landmark breakthrough. a triumph of bipartisanship. and a triumph of the scientific approach to the authorization process in legislation. financial resources while vital can alone solve the drug abuse problem. we need the coordinated federal response. provided for by this bill. if we are to maximize the impact of the substantial resources we are investing in the solution to this problem. s. 2097. a bill of many authors. is a practical. basic blueprint to catalyze the existing fragmented proliferation of drug abuse programs. i urge its passage. to enact this legislation. is to insure that our nation will have a more unified. better coordinated attack on the drug problem which so tragically afflicts so many of americas young people.
i hope the senator from louisiana and the senator from washington. withstanding my deference to them. and other members. will appreciate the degree of feeling and hope which go into the item of health manpower.
. if our goals are to be realized. we must put our appropriations where our authorization promises are. rhetoric must become reality and this. the senate appropriations committee has sought to accomplish. the increases senator magnuson and senator cottons subcommittee have recommended in their budget  only reflect their deep concern with americas health care. but their understanding of how the authorizing legislation seeks to meet the basic need for more and the right kinds of health manpower. as the ranking republican member of the senate labor and public welfare committee which had responsibility for the development of the comprehensive health manpower training act of 1971 and the nurse training act of 1971. 1 am grateful to senator magnuson and senator cotton for seeing senate action through to a reasonable conclusion by their recommendation of funding levels. i strongly recommend passage of this bill. however. i am deeply concerned about the fate of this measure when it is in conference with the house. the house appropriations committee has held hearings on the manpower and nursing supplemental requests and their bill has dollar recommendations in this area. i am concerned that without a basis for independent judgment they may insist on accepting the administrations proposed budget which i regret did  adequately respond to health manpower needs. the basic underpinning for any reform of our health care system. with which we also are deeply concerned. i urge my colleagues in the senate to give their fullest support to senators magnuson and cotton and arm them with our endorsement of their appropriations recommendations when they go to conference. i am confident senators magnuson and cotton and the other senate conferees will do everything in their power to represent the senates interest in conference with the house. they should be assured of our complete support to assure that the appropriations conference report funding levels are sufficient to carry out the purposes of this authorizing legislation. for myself. i am prepared to oppose the acceptance of any conference report that fails adequately to fund these dramatic new health manpower authorizing laws.
. the secretary of health. education. and welfare. many members of congress. and i have expressed grave concern. i believe the staten island public health service and other public health hospitals and clinics should be strengthened and modernized in order better to perform their traditional function and allow them to undertake new missions. i therefore recommended to the secretary that these professionally excellent facilities be given a new missionin accord with present and future national health care needsso that they might. for example. pioneer and develop model health care delivery systems and serve as demonstration centers for experimental programs utilizing corpsmen and other paramedical personnel to provide health services. it is my understanding that the department of health. education. and welfare did undertake to go to the communities involved for indepth discussion of alternative utilization of the public health service hospitals and clinics. including their potential for both improved care and more effective use of the existing facilities through conversion to local control and use and providing care for hew beneficiaries through contracts with the converted public health service facilities. or with public and private hospitals. from time to time hew has kept the congress informed as to the status of proposals under consideration and hing definitive has occurred. however. there are deep pervasive rumors that hew plans to take action and make profound changes in the public health service hospital system without allowing the congress to review with hew the detailed proposals for each of the public health service facilities. congress does  wish to restrain creative responses to the problem of whether the present system of public health service hospitals is the best means of fulfilling our responsibilities to public health service beneficiaries. however. the public health service hospital system is one of the oldest and most respected health institutions in america. and was created by congress. to respond to the special health problems of the merchant seamen. in addition. over the years the public health service hospital system has established close associations with their respective communities. although i am concerned with the future of the entire public health service hospital and clinic system. my primary concern is the u.s. public health service hospital located at staten island. n.y.. which. incidentally. is the largest of all the public health service hospitals throughout the united states. it has accommodations for 636 beds and has an annual payroll of approximately $13.6 million. also. the public health service hospital on staten island employs over 1.000 people and there is only one industrial concern on staten island that employs more. thus.  only will the physical health of the residents of staten island be affected by the closing of the hospital. i would also indicate that the ecoic health of the community will be seriously affected if this facility is closed. we in the congress of the united states can abandon our prerogatives regarding vital services provided by the public health service hospital system. exemplified by the public health service hospital on staten island. which: serves 420 patients per day. serves 140.000 outpatients annually. provides emergency medical services to the public. provides physical examinations and laboratory tests for a number of local agencies. provides desperately needed nurses training in cooperation with local colleges. provides desperately needed laboratory technician training. provides desperately needed dental laboratory technician training. and provides unique medical assistance for our other hospitals and their staffs. if this hospital is closed. who is going to fill the huge gap created by its absence. certainly other facility on our 60squaremile island can provide the medical services. and other nearby new york city hospitals are already crowded.
. shortages and maldistribution of health manpower exist everywhere in the world. in many developing nations. the manpower problem is extremely acute. rising expectations. dramatic increases in population. a developed awareness of the possibilities of good health. all are producing urgent demands for more health manpower and for better health delivery systems. it would seem especially appropriate to study what has been happening in mainland china.  that she is opening her doors to improved relations with other nations. as we in this country also are confronted with shortages and maldistribution of health manpower. there. the "barefoot doctor" approach. an interesting development in the use of paramedical personnel. seems to have assisted considerably in chinas health delivery system. we have our own supply of paramedical personnel in our 30.000 medical corpsmen discharged annually from the armed forces. the medical tribune and hospital tribune have published a series of articles on the subject. i ask unanimous consent that three of the articles be printed in the record so that senators may have the opportunity to study them.
i tell the senator that i think this is a very fine bill. i have only one comment to make on the question of fluoridation which was raised in committee. it was able to be shown that the evidence is so overwhelming on that subject  that the cliches and the prej udices which persisted sometime ago are  tenable in the face of the facts. i deeply believe that this may prove to be one of the best things to come out of the bill in a peripheral sense. it is a very fine bill dealing with the health of our children in a basic and constructive way and in which the chairman of the subcommittee. the senator from massachusetts . has taken a fine lead. i am very much pleased to see it come so close to the voting stage .
. as i said before. i strongly support the childrens dental health act. s. 1874. this legislationauthored by senator magnuson and of which i am a cosponsorpermits us to launch a substantially expanded federal dental health effort in this area of critical need. to begin to bring dental care to the more than half the children in this nation who have never visited a dentistand i might e that among lowincome groups the number approaches 70 uercent. which is to say that almost threequarters of these children have never seen a dentista total of $50 million is authorized over 3 years for pilot dental care projects providing preventive. corrective. and followup care to children. these dental projects will  provide care to all children or even to all ecoically disadvantaged children. we have neither the funds  the manpower to set out upon such an ambitious course. instead. these would be pilot projects whichwhile providing direct care to 1.5 million disadvantaged childrenwould also provide an opportunity for determining how quality dental care can be provided to large numbers of people with maximum efficiency and minimum cost. child should be permitted to suffer ill health because he lives in an isolated area or because his father is poor and this provision would move that principle from promise to performance. to make it possible for the american people to save a sizable proportion of the nearly $4 billion which they are spending every year on corrective dental care. the bill provides $9 million over 3 years for federal matching grants to schools or communities wishing to fluoridate their water supplies. the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation in preventing tooth decay has been demonstrated again and again and in march 1969. the surgeon general stated: the united states public health service endorses water fluoridation as a safe and effective public health measure and urges all communities to make its benefits available at the earliest possible time. i wish to repeat that i recognize that fluoridation has been the subject of intense controversy. however. dental. medical. and statistical data. judged by a committee of experts and special councils of national and international organizations concerned with public health. concluded that the adjustment of the fluoride content of water supplies to a concentration optimal for dental health is a safe and beneficial procedure with detrimental effects of any kind. in addition. longterm health studies in cities having controlled fluoridation continue to attest to the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation. also. this bill would  require any school or community to fluoridate its water. what the bill would do is assist those schools and communities which decideon their ownthat they wished to fluoridate their water. we must  only improve our dental care delivery system but also train much larger numbers of dental health personnel. while we must continue to increase our supply of dentists. we can longer rely upon dentists alone to provide dental care. the bill authorizes $57 million over 3 years to train new dental auxiliaries and thus improve our capacity for meeting increased demands for dental services. in addition. $26 million is authorized to train dentists and dental students to work with auxiliary personnel. we will thus be provided with dentists and dental auxiliaries trained to work as efficient. productive teams capable of providing higher quality dental care to more americans than ever before. for both philosophical and practical reasons. dental auxiliaries assume today more importance than ever before in our history. we k there are a number of dental care duties that auxiliaries can perform and that they can be educated in a much shorter period of time. and at much less expense than a dentist. we k that a dentist with just one welltrained auxiliary can stretch his productivity by more than 50 percent. if our shortage of dentists is acute. the shortage of dental auxiliaries is even more critical. at the present time. there are some 18.000 fulltime--or fulltime equivalentdental hygienists in practice. this gives a ratio of one hygienist to every five or six dentists. at a minimum. the desirable ratio should be one hygienist for every two dentists. the numerical shortage of trained dental assistants is even worse. presently. there are some 103.000 dental assistants in practice. giving a ratio of about 1 to 1 with repect to dentists. a minimally desirable ratio would be two assistants for every dentist. the third auxiliary. the dental laboratory technician. does  engage in chairside care  is he mally employed directly by the dentist. his work. however. is vital and the shortage here is also quite severe. based on the current graduation rate. the deficit by 1980 for these three auxiliaries with respect to the desirable ratios will be 25.000 hygienists. 137.000 assistants and 23.500 technicians. the bill would help move us toward achievement of the proper ratios in an accelerated way. the next logical step in the attempt to stretch dentists productivityand as provided for by this billis to institute. on a much broader scale than has heretofore existed. programing to instruct both the practicing dentist and the dental student on how to work most effectively with auxiliaries and thus create and use the most effective dental team possible. given what we k about the potential to be realized from effective use of auxiliaries. it would be logical to assume that dental student is permitted to graduate today without intensive instruction in this subject area. in fact. this is  so. current surveys indicate that almost first- or secondyear students receive it. and that few thirdyear students have such training. moreover. senior students have far less of it than necessary. this relative inattention lies in the fiscal crisis that has gripped the dental education system for some years . the lack of such education during school yearscoupled with the shortage of auxiliary personnelgoes far toward explaining why there are still some 15.000 dentists who practice without auxiliaries. this legislation would enable us to change this and increase the availability of dental care in a relatively short period of time.
. i strongly support the childrens dental health act. s. 1874. this legislationauthored by the senator from washington and of which i am a cosponsorpermits us to launch a substantially expanded federal dental health effort in this area of critical need. to begin to bring dental care to the more than half the children in the nation who have never visited a dentistand i might e that among lowincome groups the number approaches 70 percent. which is to say that almost threequarters of these children have never seen a dentista total of $50 million is authorized over 3 years for pilot dental care projects providing preventive. corrective. and followup care to children. these dental projects will  provide care to all children or even to all ecoically disadvantaged children. we have neither the funds  the manpower to set out upon such an ambitious course. but. these pilot projectswhile providing direct care to 1.5 million disadvantaged childrenwould provide an opportunity for determining how quality dental care can be provided to large numbers of people with maximum efficiency and minimum cost. child should be permitted to suffer ill health. because he lives in an isolated area or because his father is poor and this provision would move that principle from promise to performance. to make it possible for the american people to save a sizable proportion of the nearly $4 billion which they are spending every year on corrective dental care. the bill provides $9 million over 3 years for federal matching grants to schools or communities wishing to fluoridate their water supplies. the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation in preventing tooth decay has been demonstrated again and again and in march 1969 the surgeon general stated: the united states public health service endorses water fluoridation as a safe and effective public health measure and urges all communities to make its benefits available at the earliest possible time. i recognize that fluoridation has been the subject of intense controversy. however. dental. medical. and statistical data. judged by a committee of experts and special councils of national and international organizations concerned with public health. concluded that the adjustment of the fluoride content of water supplies to a concentration optimal for dental health is a safe and beneficial procedure with detrimental affects of any kind. in addition. longterm health studies in cities having controlled fluoridation continue to attest to the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation. also. this bill would  require any school or community to fluoridate its water. what the bill would do is assist those schools and communities which decideon their ownthat they wished to fluoridate their water. we must  only improve our dental care delivery system. but also train much larger numbers of dental health personnel. while we must continue to increase our supply of dentists. we can longer rely upon dentists alone to provide dental care. the bill authorizes $57 million over 3 years to train new dental auxiliaries and thus improve our capacity for meeting increased demands for dental services. in addition. $26 million is authorized to train dentists and dental students to work with auxiliary personnel. we will thus be provided with dentists and dental auxiliaries trained to work as efficient. productive teams capable of providing higher quality dental care to more americans than ever before. for both philosophical and practical reasons. dental auxiliaries assume today more importance than ever before in our history. we k there are a number of dental care duties that auxiliaries can perform and that they can be educated in a much shorter period of time. and at much less expense than a dentist. we k that a dentist with just one welltrained auxiliary can stretch his productivity by more than 50 percent. if our shortage of dentists is acute. the shortage of dental auxiliaries is even more critical. at the present time. there are some 18.000 fulltimeor fulltime equivalentdental hygienists in practice. this gives a ratio of one hygienist to every five or six dentists. at a minimum. the desirable ratio should be one hygienist for every two dentists. the numerical shortage of trained dental assistants is even worse. presently. there are some 103.000 dental assistants in practice. giving a ratio of about 1 to 1 with respect to dentists. a minimally desirable ratio would be two assistants for every dentist. the third auxiliary. the dental laboratory technician. does  engage in chairside care  is he mally employed directly by the dentists. his work. however. is vital and the shortage here is also quite severe. based on the current graduation rate. the deficit by 1980 for these three auxiliaries with respect to the desirable ratios will be 25.000 hygenists. 137.000 assistants. and 23.500 technicians. the bill would help move us toward achievement of the proper ratios in an accelerated way. the next. logical step in the attempt to stretch dentists productivityand as provided for by his billis to institute. on a much broader scale than has heretofore existed. programing to instruct both the practicing dentist and the dental student on how to work most effectively with auxiliaries and thus create and use the most effective dental team possible. given what we k about the potential to be realized from effective use of auxiliaries. it would be logical to assume that dental student is permitted to graduate today without intensive instruction in this subject area. in fact. this is  so. current surveys indicate that almost first- or secondyear students receive it. and that few thirdyear students have such training. moreover. senior students have far less of it than

auxiliary personnelgoes far toward explaining why there are still some 15.000 dentists who practice without auxiliaries. this legislation would enable us to change this and increase the availability of dental care in a relatively short period of time.
. i most strongly protest that particular denial of information which is absolutely essential. i attribute the denial of that information in great part to the massive cuts that are so harmful to the whole matter of health delivery which have been made in this supplemental appropriation. i will do my utmost to find a way in which congress can make it clear that it will  simply be frustrated by the sheer unwillingnessand i use all of these words advisedlyof the executive department to cooperate in giving the information. basic information. to which congress is legitimately entitled. i shall do my best to use every means available to me. including the possibility that we may be unable to act on measures they eventually want by virtue of this denial. which i consider to be unjustified and uncalled for.
. i want to express by admiration of the attorney general of the united states for his forwardlooking leadership respecting alcoholism. it is a subject that has concerned me since i introduced. with senator moss of utah. more than 10 years ago the first "alcoholism care and control act." last night at a testimonial dinner hoing mr. r. brinkley smithers for his outstanding leadership and dedication to the conquest of alcoholism and his significant contributions to the development of the comprehensive alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act of 1970. public law 91616. which the senator from iowa
. i introduce the international health agency act of 1971. an amended companion measure to h.r. 10042 introduced by mr. carey and mr. fraser and cosponsored by more than 20 members of the house of representatives. this legislation is a significant step forward in americas continuing commitment to help developing nations in the battle against disease. malnutrition. and natural disasters and in their critical need for health care.
. the drug epidemic tragically afflicts americas young people without regard to racial or socioecoic distinction. unfortunately. the tragedy of a mother and her teenage daughterso poignantly described in an article entitled "saturdays mother" published in todays new york timesis being repeated all too often throughout our nation. as legislators and parents. i believe we must dedicate ourselves to using all our talents and resources to find answers to the heartrending questions posed by the article. i commend it to the attention of senators and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
. i am introducing today on behalf of myself and senators beall and schweiker a bill. on behalf of the administration. to amend the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. entitled the "medical device safety act." the bill would authorize the secretary of health. education. and welfare to establish safety standards for medical devices. and would require unreasonably hazardous medical devices used in lifethreatening situations to undergo a scientific review by the department for safety and efficacy prior to their introduction into commerce. the scientific review section of the bill is more commonly referred to as the premarket clearance provision. it is the most dramatic portion of the bill and is intended to assure the safety and efficacy of devices used in lifethreatening situations. classes of devices that may be expected to require scientific review are cardiovascular implants. other implants composed of new materials. applications of new forms of energy to the bodyfor example. lasersand new designs for machines which substitute for major bodily functions--for example. heartlung machines. when the design and construction of any device or class of devices subject to scientific review reach the point where the safety and efficacy of the device or class may be assured under appropriate standards. such standards will be promulgated under the bills standardsetting authority. and the scientific review requirement will be ended. two examples of devices which would be subject to appropriate standards are certain types of pacemakers and catheters. i ask unanimous consent to have the bill. a letter of transmittal from the department of health. education. and welfare. and a summary of the key provisions of the bill printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. since this legislation affects medical device safety and effectiveness. pursuant to the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act. it is appropriately subject to jurisdiction of the labor and public welfare committee. of which i am ranking republican member. however. i understand the commerce committee is presently considering generic product safety legislation and the question whether the authority for evaluating product safety should be vested in an independent agency or in the department of health. education. and welfare. which is how it is done under this bill. i assure my colleagues that when this legislation is considered by our committee. we shall consult with the commerce comittee in view of their interest in the subject. although the purpose of this legislation is to provide a comprehensive regulatory program for medical devices in order to protect consumers from their potential hazards. i am concerned that the legislation as presently written is too limited in regard to its standardsetting authority for medical devices. the bill contains a limitation that there be unreasonable risk of illness or injury. i am  convinced that when we deal with the protection of consumers health we should  provide authority to deal with all risks.  merely unreasonable risks caused by medical devices. also. i am concerned that in the establishment of the various scientific advisory committees there is explicit provision for consumer representation on such committees.  is there any provision which would assure the public that the scientific advocates for a particular medical device would  be among the scientific members of the advisory committee passing upon its safety and effectiveness. on aher point i believe all of us in congress have a deep concern that there be adequate protection and humane treatment of animals. accordingly. i wish to assure all animal lovers that the exemption provision covering animals in this legislation will be carefully reviewed by the committee as the legislation receives further consideration. there is also a provision in the legislation exempting "reports on the investigational use of devices." although i share the concern that there be adequate protection of trade secrets. i am equally concerned that all information which involves the public interest be available for public scrutiny. this section of the legislation shall also be subject to careful review by the committee. finally. the legislation does  provide funding authorizations for the activities to be conducted pursuant to the legislation and would. therefore. rely upon the general department of health. education. and welfares funding authorities. i am concerned that if we are to adequately protect the public. we should require specific funding authorizations in this bill. this will also be subject to careful review by the committee.
. the tragic and alarming increase in venereal disease was reported in the new york times magazine section of ember 7. 1971. in an article entitled "the venereal disease panic" by cokie and steven v. robert. and then in a newsweek cover story on january 24. 1972. entitled "vd: the epidemic." i commend both articles to the attention of my colleagues. and i ask unanimous consent to have these articles and the article entitled "costs of uncontrolled syphilis." appearing in the hew booklet. "vd fact sheet1970." printed in the record at this point.
. with the senator from utah (mr. moss). we pioneered the struggle to establish a national commitment for the conquest of alcoholism. thereafter. senator hughes of iowa took on a guest role in the battle against alcoholismthe nations fourth most serious health problemwhich culminated in the enactment into law of the comprehensive "alcoholism prevention. treatment and rehabilitation act of 1970"-public law 9116. which senator hughes and i introduced with the cosponsorship of over half of the senate. i invite the attention of senators to a special report on alcoholism. published in american medical news of february 7. 1972. the article is entitled "alcoholics face a therapy gap" and describes in the words of one of the nations leading authorities. dr. morris e. chafetz. director of the division of alcohol abuse and alcoholism of the national institute of mental health. how alcoholism has become "the most treatable untreated illness." he blames much of the problem on the "negligent attitude of physicians toward alcoholic patients." the american medical association is to be commended. as this report published in their weekly newspaper  only focuses attention on alcoholism as a disease. but also forthrightly puts the responsibility for much of the problem on physicians attitudes. it is rare indeed when a professional publication admits to such fault of attitude among its professionals. i ask unanimous consent that the complete text of "alcoholics face a therapy gap" and the american medical news editorial entitled "treating the alcoholic" be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. one solution to the problems of stimulating medical school interest in alcoholism as a disease. which is highlighted in this report. will. i hope be found in the amendment by senator hughes and me to the comprehensive health manpower training act of 1971public law 91157which provides incentives to medical schools. through special project grants. for the development of programs in the prevention. diagis. treatment. and rehabilitation of alcoholics and the assessment of the efficacy of various therapeutic regimens.
. i believe methadone maintenance treatment programs to be an effective procedure for reducing the large number of heroin addicts. and have introduced with senator hughes the drug addict treatment and rehabilitation act of 1971 to launch a national commitment to the establishment of substantial numbers of methadone maintenance treatment programs where needed. for example. in new york. despite heroic state and city efforts to eliminate the waiting lists of addicts voluntarily requesting methadone maintenance treatment programs. there are estimates of approximately 20.000 addicts who want methadone maintenance treatment programs. but funds and personnel are  available. hence. an estimated $1 million a day in stealing may be the result of this failure. methadone maintenance is  a shortterm treatment process. but the reported results have been promising. i commend to the attention of my colleagues an article on methadone maintenance appearing in the february 16. 1972. issue of the medical tribune entitled "treatment of heroin addicts with methadone is defended." which describes the problems and sample results of methadone maintenance. this article points out that methadone has adverse effects on the human body. as compared to the horrible alternative effects of heroin. and many of the sample patients have shown remarkable advancement. of the 1.150 patients tested. 75 percent secured a job as compared to only 25 percent previously employed and aher 13 percent have returned to school. methadone maintenance is a longterm treatment that has helped heroin addicts to return to a mal productive life. and i believe that these people should be given a second chance at life. by helping them. we are. in turn. helping ourselves. i ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the article from the medical tribune be printed in the record.
 in his state of the union message. these programs would include research. treatment. and training. and the director and the advisory committee would then submit a plan to the congress with their recommendations for appropriations. the time has come when we must recognize the serious proportion of cardiovasuclar and pulmonary diseases. and their threatening effects on the health and wellbeing of the american people. it has. therefore. become imperative that we broaden the scope of the present national heart institute created by this legislation to include the related diseases of the heart. blood vessels. lungs. and blood. envisioned within the national heart and lung institute. . in closing. i would like to quote from my 1948 testimony that is sadly so applicable today: at a time when we are considering the national security of the nation. we certainly should consider this. one great disease which saps so much in the way of human resources from us and should feel that. if on other grounds. it can be justified as a national security investment. the great accomplishments of the national heart instituteand what it may portend for the futurewere in great measure seen in the press reports about the first atomicpowered heart engine. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the hew press summary describing the atomicpowered engines that can be utilized with heartassist systems be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of our separate views be printed in the record following the summary of the findings and recommendations of the commission. and that a list containing the names of the members of the commission also be printed. the report is comprehensive and thorough. and will assist materially in clearing the air of much misinformation and emotion which has heretofore prevented the development of rational social policy regarding this drug. i urge members of congress to give their closest attention to this important report and the recommendations of the commission. senator hughes and i intend to introduce shortly appropriate legislation to accomplish several of the objectives found in the recommendations of the commission. we hope that others--in congress. as well as parents. young people and others throughout the nationwill take a fresh look at the problem of marihuana in our society with the new perspective provided by the commissions report. i commend the distinguished former gover of pennsylvania. raymond p. shafer. who. as chairman of the commission. provided important leadership in the development of the report. i commend also the vice chairman. dr. dana l. farnsworth. other members of the commission and its executive director. michael lowenreichamericans of dedication and insightwho devoted much time away from their personal and professional interests to participate so productively in this effort. lastly. i wish to congratulate the staff of the commission which worked particularly effectively under great pressure to complete the first years work of the commission. i look forward to the secondyear study of the commission which will deal with the critically important subject of drug abuse in the united states.
. i want to commend the chairman of the senate health subcommittee. the distinguished senator from massachusetts and the chairman of the house public health and environment subcommittee. the distinguished representative from florida
i think i can persuade the senator that what i have in mind is proper. one can say that it should be 60 instead of 61 or 59. but i think it is the right approach. and i will explain why. i think what we are really doing is establishing a threshold operation. if the committee feels that it is the body to do this job. it will come in and seek more time and will get it. there is question about that. on the other hand. the committee very well may decide that this is a question of which other committees ought to be seizedjudiciary. foreign relations. armed services. or any combination of them. also. that perhaps other things ought to be done in the senate with respect to this matter. therefore. as a threshold committee. in order really to give us a blueprint for the way we ought to approach this matteri thoroughly agree with the senator that they can possibly come out in 60 days with any mature resolution on this subject which will be satisfactory to the senate and the countryi do believe that in 60 days a committee at this level can chart the way we ought to go. they will advise that they will handle it. that other ommittees should handle itor whatever way they think we ought to go. therefore. i think it would tend to be reassuring to senators. perhaps. who would  wish it locked into this kind of td hoc committee but would rather have he freedom to say. "let every committee iandle it on its own." or whatever argunent they wish to use. sixty days seems to me to be just about the outside parameter on both sidesthat is.  too short so that they really can do anything and  so long as for anybody to feel that "they are locked in. they axe seized of this. they are the only body that is going to do it. so i have to make a permanent decision if that is where i want to entrust it." i suggest to the senator that this is about the right prescription for . bearing in mind that the committee will tell us where they think we ought to go.
. i commend the willingness of the education system to join in the struggle. much more of this needs to be done. this is very definitely a struggle to achieve public kledge concerning the venereal disease tragedy. i am so pleased to see that a totally new attitude  prevails. indeed. the legislation itself contemplates assistance for precisely this type of education and information. so. i join with the senator from massachusetts in gratification that the legislation has reached this far and that it will. without much question. become law. and i will certainly join with the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from massachusetts in a major effort to see that the funding to achieve this result meets the promise made for this organization. i hope very much that the vote will be unanimous on the adoption of this bill.
. prog. ress in this area has been slowed by the l paucity of researchers interested in tht i sudden infant death syndrome. the absence of the sudden infant death synl drome from the international classification of diseases. and the very nature of the syndrome itself. in which death occurs suddenly and without warning. recognizing the inherent difficulties of this research area. hew plans to direct research efforts toward identifying factors which predispose infants to the sudden infant death syndrome and emphasis will be placed upon the study of developmental physiologic pheena on a longitudinal basis during the first 9 months of life. with this approach. it should be possible to identify interrelationships between physiologic events in the growing infant. his environment. and the occurrence of the syndrome. and subsequently to develop approaches to intervention and prevention. in addition. hew has encouraged the inclusion of the sudden infant death syndrome in the ninth edition of the international classification of diseases. which will make possible a reliable index of the incidence and distribution of sudden infant death cases throughout the nation- in addition. states and localities will be encouraged through hew educational and informational activities to make autopsies available for the victims of the .sudden infant death syndrome. with prompt dissemination of findings to the parents. . i . although much needs to be done to achieve the purpose of the resolution to assure that maximum resources and efforts are concentrated on medical research into sudden infant death syndrome and on the extension of services to families who lose children to the disease. i am pleased to e that hew has undertaken many important first steps.

. as the ranking republican member of the committee on labor and public welfare which had responsibility for the development of the authorizing legislation for vital health programsthe education of health manpower. the conduct and support of medical research. mental health programs.with its full range of professional training programs and services. including alcoholism. narcotics addiction and drug abuse. comprehensive health planning -and services. regional medical programs. and medical facilities constructioni am grateful to senator magnuson and senator cotton for seeing senate action through to a reasonable conclusion.
in the last analysis. the question comes down to whether we really believe that all american workers need and deserve the protection of occupational safety and health standards. in my judgment. just to ask that question is to answer it. an employee of a small business is less subject to occupational dangers to his health or even his life than an employee of a large business. if certain standards should be observed in order to protect a worker. there is reason to say that they should be observed by a large employer but  a small employer. it also bears emphasis that the standards about which the small businessmen are  complaining are for the most part "national consensus" standards which have been developed with the approval and consent of the business community itself. the complaints we are  receiving about enforcement of these standards which the business community itself developed demonstrate the futility of a completely voluntary approach to health and safety problems. of course manyperhaps most--small businesses in this country are engaged in essentially hazardous activities to the extent that this is true. small business will be less affected by the provisions of the new law than larger businesses. in addition. the labor depart. ments policy of concentrating on "targel industries"-those with the worst injurl recordwill further reduce the impac of the new law on small businesses ex. cept those that are within the target in. dustry group. also. since the availabl( manpower for enforcement purposes is extremely limitedonly about 800 federal inspectors are  in the fieldit is to be expected that the labor department would focus most of its efforts on larger businesses as the way to get the most protection for the largest number of employees utilizing existing resources. finally. aher excellent reason why we should  enact this amendment is that under the law. at the end of this year those states which have  filed an acceptable state plan will be completely preempted by the federal law. if this amendment is adopted. employees of small businesses in these states will have protection whatsoever. . one point i wish to make in response to the earlier plea made by the proponents is this. we were conscious of that. when the inspector goes around he issues what is equivalent to a traffic ticket. he serves a citation. a lot of people view it in the same way as one gets a traffic ticket. he immediately sends a check and forgets it. but it can be contested. and it is the same way with the small businessman. in addition to that. the review commission has kked down many of the fines and many of the citations. other than that. we ourselves. outside the law. in legislative oversight. have corrected problems of this kind if in our communities. i am sure it is true of other senators. we get a "beef" and we correct it. the only plea we make here is. why jeopardize 20 million workers for things we ourselves can correct. that is the relative essence of the amendment. why jeopardize 20 million workers for things we can correct ourselves. on january 1. 1973. preemption will take effect. we could get into the situation where a small businessman will be employing workers who will  be under either a state law or a federal law. ii inspectors are going into that place of employment. and state law applies because of the preemption. it wil be jn a desert and we will be here wringt ing our hands and hearing. "what have - you done to the employees."
. i ask unanimous consent that a summary and the introduction to the report of the workmens compensation commission as authorized by the occupational health and safety act of 1970 be printed in the record.
. i support the passage of h.r. 15474. the national cooleys anemia control act. through this measure. congress can wage war on this disease. the bill establishes a national commitment to provide research support in cooleys anemiaa genetic blood disorder. whose tragic disease incidence is estimated at 5.000 individuals of mediterranean origin and affects 200.000 others as carriers of the traitand support for screening. counseling and education to minimize the possibility of more children being affected by the disease. which results in pain. suffering and early death. the legislation under consideration is similar to what congress has accomplished under public law 92294 for sickle cell anemia. cooleys anemia is also a hereditary blood disease. if two parents have the geneboth father and mother carry the traitone child. according to the mendelian law. will more than likely have the disease. two will carry the gene or the trait. one will be free of the trait. in other words. onefourth of the youngsters born to families in which both mother and father carry this particular gene will have cooleys anemia. the senate amendments i have cosponsored would place greater emphasis on the initiation of federal programs to develop and disseminate educational materials by increasing the authorization for these purposes from $25.000 annually to $1 million annually. educational programs specifically targeted to reach those groups of americans at risksimilar to what was done for sickle cell anemiaso they can be informed of screening tests and the genetic implication of the disease need increased funding if they are to be appropriately stimulated. the most effective means by which to control a diseaseparticularly cooleys anemiais prevention of its occurrence. also. the senate amendments "technical" provision will assure the continuation of appropriate community representation in the development and operation of programs funded under this act.
. the recent tragic newspaper accounts about human being in syphilis research projects and other reported experiments involving human subjectscited in a library of congress. congressional research service. august 4. 1972. reportdemonstrates the need for the bill i introduce today. while it is true that much of the research involving human subjects at riskexclusive of human subject research and experimentation undertaken pursuant to the informed patient consent amendment to the food. drug. and cosmetics act which i authoredis done under the auspices of hew research guidelines assuring ethical guidance. i believe congress has a responsibility to assure meaningful legal controls of federally supported research activities involving human subjects. the bill i introduce today to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in federally funded research activities is patterned upon nih research guidelines which seek to accomplish that desirable objective. i believe it would be most constructive if the department of health. education. and welfare were to name a panel of leaders selected from the fields of medicine. law. theology. biological science. physical science. social science philosophy. humanities. health administration. government. and public affairs. to provide an indepth study and evaluation of the ethical. social. and legal implications of the tragic tuskegee syphilis experimentincluding why only black human subjects were selected to participate in the projectand also. to determine the adequacy of the present nih guidelines. if we are to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects. i believe perhaps more should be done. if such a distinguished panel were named to conduct a prompt and thorough indepth study. i also believe it would be appropriate to delay action on this bill until we have the benefit of such a study. although medical experimentation on human beings is as old as recorded historythe ancient persians experimented on condemned criminalsthe anticipated and necessary increase in human subject research in an effort to conquer cancer and cure and prevent heart diseasewith the desire to apply new kledge quickly and broadly to the nations health problemsmake it prudent for the congress to act  to provide additional statutory protection for the rights of individuals who participate in scientific research.
s special action office for drug abuse prevention with new york city and state officials to see what more could be done to aid addicted veterans. one thing became clear as the result of that meeting: the need for additional legislationas set forth in this billwhich would provide the va authority to contract with approved community programs for treatment and rehabilitation of addicted veterans. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of three letters i sent to the va. urging them to contract with other agencies to provide drug treatment to all veterans who need treatment. be printed at this point in the record.
. my distress and concern about va drug treatment and care for new yorks addicted vietnam veterans was confirmed by howard a. jones. chairman of the new york state narcotic addiction control commission. and graham s. finney. commissioner of the new york city addiction services agency. and is further confirmed by the report of the committee. it ought to be placed in the record. so i ask unanimous consent that those paragraphs of the committee report be printed at this point in the record.
. the bill also focuses upon the problem of alcoholism. the signing of the comprehensive alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act of 1970 into law marked a most historic day in the national struggle against alcoholism and the end of a legislative struggle which began in 1966. when i introduced the first alcoholism bill with the senator from utah (mr. moss) and which culminated in the passage of the bill which i introduced in the 91st congress with the senator from iowa . the senator from utah (mr. moss). and more than 50 cosponsors. i am. therefore. pleased that s. 2108 will authorize the va to utilize more effectively its emous resources in the stepped up national fight against alcoholism and reduce the emous toll taken by alcoholism and alcohol abuse on our society.
. i am gratified that the senate yesterday passed the conference report on the "communicable diseases control amendments act of 1971" . and wish personally to comment on title ii of the bill which deals with the establishment of venereal disease prevention and control programs. i was the author of the "national venereal disease prevention and control act" which had the bipartisan support of 40 senators. and i am pleased to commend to their attention. and to the attention of all my colleagues. that. in essence. this bill has been incorporated by the managers on the part of the house and senate as title ii of the legislation. i am very grateful to all the conferees for adopting as the conference substitute my provision for a separate program of assistance for veneral disease. venereal disease has reached epidemic proportionswitnesses estimated that there were 2.500.000 cases of gorhea and 100.000 cases of infectious syphilis in the united states during 1971and level of society is immune. the sad statistics are that vd strikes our affluent suburbs as well as our inner cities. to allow us to be effective in combating this tragic disease. title ii of the bill authorizes $7.500.000 for project grants for the conduct of research. demonstrations. and training with respect to the prevention and control of venereal disease. $25.000.000 for formula grants to states for establishing and maintaining public health programs for the diagis and treatment of venereal disease. and $30.000.000 for project grants to states and political subdivisions for the conduct of defined. comprehensive venereal disease prevention and control programs. the grant funds authorized by this title of the bill. a total of $62.500.000. will provide the federal commitment and resources to enable states and communities to once again start down the road toward the eradication of syphilis.
. i hope  only that the senate will pass this bill. as  seems obvious. but also that we will be able to get together with the house in this session and that the bill may then become law. because. as we have perceived in our committee. in cases of healthprobably uniquely in cases of healththe leadtime is very long as between the development of an idea. its implementation. and its fruits. in view of the problems of adequate training for personnel and other problems connected with really setting up for the delivery of the services for which we provide in this legislation. my only purpose in this brief statement is to emphasize the importance of this bill to the total complex of medical care in the united states. withstanding the fact that it has  been extensively debated. and to congratulate senator kennedy upon the fine work of the health subcommittee. which has produced this measure and many other measures of tremendous benefit to the people of our country.
. i am opposed to the amendment offered by senator dominick. it would. in effect.  only provide that medical care foundations are placed on an equal basis for federal financial assistance. but also "water down" the committees carefully structured and defined classic hmo. i emphasize again that an individual joining an hmo is voluntary compulsory. the amendment would longer require the medical group forming the hmo to engage in the coordinated practice of their profession as "their principal professional activity." thus. the medical groups responsibility to be principally concerned about the health care of a defined patient population would be negated. rather. such a defined patient population would become a segment of each physicians overall patient load and readily identifiable as such. the amendment would mean the individual doctor in his separate individual office. on an individual feeforservice. without assured continuity of health maintenance could continue without real change in the system being effectuated. this is true because the amendments addition of "other" would clearly permit feeforservice as the means of physician reimbursement. and. rather than requiring the physicians to "jointly use or share medical records". -it modifies this to include only "substantial portions" thereof. i believe the amendment would result in major change in a real sense in the health care delivery system from what it is . let me make clear that my opposition to this amendment does  mean that i do  believe medical care foundations offer a potential also for improving the health care delivery system. and i cite. for example. the accomplishments of the san joaquin foundation. however. the medical care foundation is at the initial stage of its development and what it will do precisely is still undetermined while the classic hmo is clearly defined. my support for the potential for change offered by the medical care foundation is readily seen in the provision in the bill i authorized--section 1109which authorized funding assistance for the development of "medical care foundation supported hmos which can meet reasonable criteriasimilar to those in the administration bill i introduced. also. i supported the bills provisions to provide funding assistance to medical care foundation hmosdefined as health service organizations in the billfor rural and other metropolitan areas. however. the record should be made clear that medical care foundations are  philanthropic organizations. rather. they are a concept for a system for the delivery of health care. i believe the medical care foundation does seek to improve the health care delivery systemalthough i recognize the concern expressed by many that the medical care foundation is organized medicines response to maintaining the status quobut  to the degree contemplated by. the pending bills criteria for hmos and. therefore. medical care foundations should until they are prepared to meet such criteriabe eligible for federal support on a first dollar basis. the american people have a right to free choice in how they elect to receive health care. that is the intent and purpose of the billto give our citizens a choiceand the amendment would stifle that choice. at present. there is. in reality. choice. for 96 percent of medical care is provided by solo practice or specialty group on a feeforservice basis. and only 4 percent of medical practice is in the form of the hmo model. if we are to make the right of free choice a reality. we must supply incentives for changing the pattern of how medical care is provided. the bill stimulates the development of hmos. thus. the american people can then freely make the decision of whether they prefer the bills multigroup practice in which salaried medical specialists and other health professionals and allied health personnel offer one stop health care for a predetermined fixed annual amount or the existing system. a fee for each service renderedif they have the means to pay the fee and can find the physician to render the service. i am deeply concerned that the bills ecoic incentive for the providers to avoid overutilization of health care services will be overturned by the amendments support of feeforservice. the ama has publicly stated. in response to questions regarding hmos during the committees extensive hearings. that: in individual cases. medical services could be encouraged in feeforservice practice. also. i am concerned that first dollar support of a watereddown medical group. contemplated by the amendment. will indicate support for the retention of provider dominated "policing" of health care. because of the ecoic incentive for efficiency. there is the potentiality in the hmo model for underutilization of services and. if for other reason. it is therefore urgent that patients have input into the issue of quality of care provided. i believe it is time that patients had input  only into the formation of hmos. but also into the review of the quality of the care rendered. the input of physicians is essential if we are to effectively improve the nations health care delivery.
reserving the right to object. and i hope that we can work it out with the senator. i have ed that. and i would suggest that he make his unanimous consent request apply to the title and all other incidental amendments which flow from the first. i do  k but what we may have some feeling. even if the senators amendment should carry respecting what he would call these health organizations. but i do  expect that we would have any problem about it. but i think it should  just go with the substantive amendment which the senator is making. would the senator mind doing that.
i do  want to foreclose the senator. i just suggest in dividing the vote that we divide it between the amendment on page 106 and all the other amendments being considered en bloc. and the one on page 106. that is just a practical way to get at what may result from adoption or rejection of the one on page 106. it may still be a good idea to call it a community health maintenance organization. even if the senator loses.
. i appreciate what the senator said. it is entirely agreeable to me. although i believe that the health maintenance organizations of a classic character described in the bill are vital to the future provision of health care for all the american people. i also believe that the supplemental health maintenance organization ought to have a chance to improve its worth and it is defined under the bill as qualified under the bill. therefore. i feel that the provision  being made for its having a chance to prove its worth is an appropriate one and i hope the amendment is agreed to.
. it is far advanced. the estimate of what is being spent in the united- states for health care per annum is well in excess of $60 billion a year. i believe the exact figure is well over that. we have debated for years  one form of being able to cover all americans. certainly. on the health issue. therefore. as i believe we are already far advanced into this field. and that this is an essential plateau upon which we must learn to stand. i believe the requirements plus the carrot. which is the appropriation. will enable us to bring the american medical delivery system to a point where it will  be the highly expensive and relatively exclusive province. in terms of many millions of americans. that it is today. i think it is rather to the credit of the senator from colorado -and he has shown this beforethat although he has very grave reservations. he allows himself to go along with an effort to try something out. though expressing his doubts. he will still vote "yea." his point of view has been very important on our committee. i for one. as i am so close to him on this committee. value very much that attitude of a very enlightened american conservative. i think it is very sensible. and i appreciate it very much.
. i join the senator from massachusetts in thanking the staff members especially. they always do such an unbelievably herculean job and in this case. with such a complex situation. they acquitted themselves admirably on the majority and the miity side. i also wvant to thank the senator from colorado for his fine feelings of assessing exactly what he wanted to accomplish and ecoizing on the time and effort of the senate. he did exactly what he wanted to doless and moreand then allowed the senate to vote. his attitude was admirable and we all owe him a special vote of thanks. i should also like to congratulate the senator from massachusetts in piloting this bill through. i consider this to be a real inlestone in progress towards universal quality health care for the people of this country. whatever plan we ultimately adopt. this is one of the essential elements in the infrastructure9 without which ones plan. the american medical associations. mr. kennedys. mine. or anyone elses. would be possible. i thank the chair.
. i was one of the authors of the federal age discrimination in employment act of 1967 and have fought against the evil of age discrimination all of my political life. age discrimination is every bit as insidious as discrimination based on race. religion. or sex. indeed. in many cases its effect on the individual may be more devastating than other forms of prohibited discrimination. the federal age discrimination in employment act. as well as many state acts. have unquestionably helped elimi ... nate some of the more open and orious types of age discrimination which have been practiced in this countly. but they certainly have  eradicated it completely. even among persons covered by the laws. moreover. most of the laws. including the federal act. do  afford any protection to -workers over the age. of 65. indeed the new york state commission survey was undertaken in connection with gover rockefellers drive to eliminate the age65 cutoff in the new york state law. the use of age 65 as the mal retirement age apparently goes back to the first social security laws enacted in europe at the end of the 19th century. ii is. of course. used in our own social security law. and is also used in thousands of private retirement plans throughout the country. it is also the age for compulsory retirement under many private plans. it would seem fairly obvious. given the fantastic improvement in health care. longevity. and the nature of most workfor example. much less manual laborthat we ought to reassess the validity of using a concept developed in the 19th century as our rule of thumb for throwing workers on the scrap heap. the study conducted by the new york state commission is thus most timely and should prove of great interest to those who are interested in pursuing this subject further. i ask unanimous consent that the new york times article be printed in the record.
madam president. the problem here involves an extension of the socalled free choice deadline which poses a great problem to the government of puerto rico. i offer this amendment at the request of . they request that we give them an added period of 3 years. i understand this is satisfactory to the manager of the bill on the majority and miity sides. the reason for this proposed amendment is that it has been determined by both the department of health. education. and welfare and by the puerto rico department of health that it would be impossible with the resources available at this time to implement the freedom of choice provision under the medicaid program. the funds puerto rico receives under this program have been limited ever since 1967 by a statutory ceiling of $20 million per year under section 1108 (c) (1) of the social security act. the puerto rican government invests more than $70 million a year out of their own resources for this program to provide medical care for the poor. at present the program serves more than 61/2 million cases of indigent patients throughout several district hospitals and clinics on the island. the puerto rican government is aware that freedom of choice of physician and hospitals should  be denied to anyone and as a matter of fact is taking steps on its own to implement a limited program that would provide a limited freedom of choice to about 1.7 million people or to all members of families earning less than $5.000 a year. this free choice will at first. include only general practitioners and in time will be expanded to include some specialists. laboratories and xrays. plans have also been made for a complete free choice programthese plans were and are contingent upon the approval of an additional $10 million in federal funds authorized in title ii of h.r. 1. the plan was designed as a gradual development into free choice to be completed by fiscal year 1973 when free choice is to go into effect in puerto rico. as mandated in the social security act. congress has  yet authorized the additional $10 million under the medicaid program for puerto rico and therefore they have  been able to implement this plan. they will have to start free choice very soon if this amendment is  adopted. and there is time for a gradual changeover. the puerto rican government feels that it can afford the fiscal burden this abrupt change would necessitate.
. i wish to read the first two paragraphs of the letter. the letter states in part: yesterday. the senate appropriations committee reported h.r. 16654. the laborhew appropriations bill for fiscal year 1973. in adopting the conference version of h.r. 15417. the committee gave its approval to a provision which would exempt firms employing fifteen or fewer employees from coverage under the occupational safety and health act of 1970. the department of labor is opposed to such a provision. which would exempt more than 86 percent of all business establishments from coverage under the act and thereby jeopardize the health and safety of a full onefourth of the nations work force. i shall hand a copy of the letter to the senator from nebraska.
twentyfive employees is the definition of a small businessman. the only reason we suggest that this proposal go on the pending bill is that the bill will probably result in some arrangement with the house of representatives. in view of the number of complaints received hereof small businesses being involved with difficulty under the occupational health and safety act.
i happen to have a copy. i will be happy to make it available for any senator who wishes to see it. this is on the subject of the special action office for drug abuse prevention. if the chairman will give me his attention. the figure for the special fund has been set at $30 million. the amount which was requested for this special fund was $40 million. mally. one would say. "great. you allowed 75 percent. who can argue about that." but i feel that this is a matter on which i would like to appeal to the chairmans sense of equity. rather than first submit an amendment. because i think it concerns us all. this particular fund. essentially. is to clean up the waiting list for the methadone maintenance program. we have a chart from dr. jaffee. a very gifted man whom the president has put on this job. which shows the current waiting list to 27.940 persons. and that the amount required to clean up that waiting list comes to $69.850.000. i shall be very happy to have it inspected. this appropriation of $30 million falls a bit short of actually enabling us to clean up the waiting list for the program. the amount really required would be somewhat in the area of $40 million. i will state the exact figures in a moment. i think all of us would be appalled if we looked at the list of cities in which there are methadone maintenance waiting lists. i am  very proud of my home city of new york. which seems to have attracted narcotics addicts like honey does flies. it is unbelievable. but when one sees that so many other states and so many other cities are involved in this scourge. ranging almost literally right across the country. i think it would appall any senator. and. of course. right . until we find an antagonist or some way of dealing with this current illness the only real thing we can do to take these narcotics addicts out of the criminal category is methadone maintenance. at least when they seek it. and all of these i have discussed are seeking it. so i would like to ask the senator this question: is there some reason why the committee felt it should just provide the $30 million amount. had the committee seen this list. which is certainly authoritative. and the amount which is required in order to do the job. because if it was  before it. i think it would strongly appeal to judgment and reason that we should give them the necessary money at least to clean up these methadone maintenance waiting lists. that is an elementary precaution we could take to at least get rid of as many addicts as we could. with this treatment.
. i am deeply concerned by reported health budget cuts. while i commend hew initiatives to assure a federal policy which would have federally initiated and supported demonstration health service programs seeking the most efficient way to obtain maximum reimbursement from thirdparty resources and. the most effective in their management policies. the implementation of such a policy must . through precipitate budget cutbacks. deprive the people of vitally needed health care. the devastating effect of drastic slashes in federal funding support has already been felt in new york where the gouverneur hospital health center budget was cut by $260.000 and the lower east side nena neighborhood helith center budget has been cut by more than 13 percent. the tragic significance of such federal action is in itself denial to people of health care services. until we have a national health insurance program which guarantees a minimum standard of health care benefits. we can deprive millions of americans of their right to health care by pennywise. pound foolish budget cuts. unfortunately. it is estimated that the promise of medicaid to all in need of health care does  reach more than 20 million of the poor and medically indigent. therefore. in the interim. existing federal project grant programs targeted to povide health care to those people can be permitted to vanish through budgetcutting magic. moreover. if this were to happen. the people served by these programs will have place to go but to the already overburdened. outmoded. and obsolete public hospitalshospitals whose lives are already in critical danger of extinction due to their fiscal crisis. in addition. many of the vitally needed services provided by federally supported health programs include nutrition and health education. outreach. and manpower training. for which thirdparty reimbursement mechanism presently exists. i have. also. grave concerns about drastic reductions in funds for the programs of the national institutes of health. inadequate support for biomedical research and health profession education would be false ecoy. all our efforts at the federal level to reduce skyrocketing health care costs become inconsequential in the face of the cost benefits realized through lifesaving biomedical research. jonas salks research virtually eliminated polio as a dread disease. and the importance of this discovery in human terms for all americans can also be measured in ecoic dimensions by merely targeting in on the previously more than 50.000 annual polio victims. for whom there are  medical or hospital bills or costly rehabilitative therapy for the treatment of polio and whose working life is saved for the nation.
. my good friend ralph j. bunche. succumbed a year ago to the many ailments he had long suffered. the worlds loss is less than our personal one. it is the wish of all who knew and admired ralph bunche and who are familiar with his extraordinary services to humanity to establish a memorial that will keep alive his memory. and the spirit of compassion. service. and international cooperation which were so integral to his life. such a plan is  underway. and today i should like to familiarize members of congress with these plans. in the last years of his life. ralph bunche suffered from a multitude of ailments. among them kidney disease. and for considerable periods he was cared for at the new york hospitalcornell medical center. owing to the emous progress currently being made there. he was accorded considerable relief from the debilitating consequences of this disease. during this time. dr. bunche became familiar with the widespread suffering caused by kidney failure as well as with the fact that the treatment facilities and trained personnel throughout the world are grossly insufficient in relation to the need for them. the ralph bunche memorial is. therefore. designed as a twopronged endeavor geared toward the direct care of kidney disease patients and the training and utilization of medical manpower. this goal will be achieved by first creating a 21bed pavilionnamed in ho of ralph buncheto serve as an inpatient care facility at the new york hospitalcornell medical center and also provide intensive care for kidney disease patients. the pavilion will contain a special center to train four patients at a time in the methods of dialyzing themselves at home. this will be augmented by a dialysis facility capable of maintaining 48 outpatients at a time on artificial kidney machines. the second phase of the program will be the ralph bunche international fellowship program. designed to provide training opportunities for qualified doctors. nurses. and paraprofessionals interested in the treatment and research of kidney disease. fellows from throughout the world will participate in the program. the fellowships for doctors would last 1 to 2 years depending on experience. during the fellowship the doctor will have intensive exposure to chronic kidney disease. acute kidney failure. dialysis treatment. kidney transplantation. plus the opportunity to study the problems of fluid and salts loss that so frequently accompany such widespread infectious diseases as cholera and diarrhea. the entire project requires $2 million in funding. the memorial committee and friends of ralph bunche have. raised almost $400.000. gifts are being sought from governments and private sources throughout the world for the pavilion and the fellowships. it is my hope and one that is shared by ralph bunches colleagues in the united nations that this memorial will be truly international. helping people from throughout the world. it will then reflect the great compassion ralph bunche had for all mankind. the new york hospitalcornell medical center is already a center of international patient referral for kidney diseases and the training going on there has enabled doctors. scientists. and nurses worldwide to acquire the techniques that have been perfected there. the ralph bunche pavilion and the ralph bunche fellowships will permit this treatment. research. and training to expand to new levels to treat more patients and train more of the doctors and nurses who are so sorely needed throughout the world.
i thank the senator from missouri. (the remarks senator javits made at this point on the introduction of s. 915. the national health insurance and health services improvement act. and s. 916. authorization of appropriations for the national foundation of the arts and humanities. are printed in the record under "statement on introduced bills and joint resolutions.")
. i thank the deputy majority leader and the deputy miity leader for their courtesy. (the remarks senator javits made at this point on the introduction of s. 972. the health maintenance assistance act of 1973. s. 974. dealing with special medical grants and contracts. and senate concurrent resolution 12. dealing with the office of ecoic opportunity. are printed in the record under "statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions and under the appropriate heading for the concurent resolutions.)
. i would like to comment on and lend my every support to the three bills reported by the veterans affairs committee which are  before the senate. s. 59. s. 49. and s. 284. in the many years i have served in both the house and the senate. i have seen the congress seek the initiative in providing the recognition of our nations veterans and their problems. with americas military role in vietnam and the hoable service of the 22 million veterans who served their completed. we need to continue merited services to the veteran and his family. to the disabled veteran. a nation owes a great debt. for the 2.2 million veterans with service connected disabilities. and in particular the 206.000 disabled vietnam veterans. there is much to be done. the senates consideration of this important legislation affecting veterans drug treatment and rehabilitation. medical care and cemeterial expenses comes at a time when there has been recent public discussion on veterans health care and disability rating. since the veterans administrations proposal to change the disability rates for vietnamera veterans. i have received close to 1.000 letters of public outcry against any disability payment reduction. this strong spirit voiced by new york citizens. as well as similar communications received by my fellow colleagues. was heard and i feel certain resulted in the withdrawal by the va of such a disability rate change. within the past few days the news media reported in a study by the center for the study of responsive law. criticism of the current veterans medical rehabilitative services and the administrative procedure for service discharge due to drug use. there appears to be a "catch 22" in a veterans eligibility for drug rehabilitation. whereby. "to get treatment for drug use. one must have a good discharge.  a bad one. but to get a good discharge. one must  use drugs." i believe we must provide the veteran with realistic and timely assistance when the need is present. the three bills we discuss today. s. 49. the national cemeteries act of 1973. s. 59. veterans health care expansion act of 1973. and s. 284. veterans drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitative act of 1973. are directed toward the goal.
subsequently said. . i wish to identify myself with the introduction of a measure extending certain authorities in the public health service by the chairman of the subcommittee on health of the committee on labor and public welfare. the senator from massachusetts . i am the ranking member of the committee. these programs are urgently required. they should  be tied up in long. delaying proceedings. when the only necessity at this time is a simple extension. i am very pleased to take this initiative with the senator from massachusetts . i very greatly appreciate. as i am sure he dobs. the willingness of the senate. at least in the absence of objections. to go that route. i hope that next week these authorities may be extended and certainty given to the program which is urgently necessary for it to be successfully prosecuted.
. by those who vote. whichever way they vote. that this is a justiciable question and undoubtedly will be submitted for consideration by the courts. so much for the constitutional issue. i would like to move  to the practicalities of the amendment itself. and if i may have senator churchs attention. i would appreciate it greatly. it has been suggested to me that two amendments are necessary if we would go this route. one would be a provision that such a hospital or health care institution as is benefited by this amendment may. withstanding the fact that state laws may  proscribe such treatment. proscribe it itself because of the religious views of those who sponsor or administer it. should we  provide that such institution. however. may discriminate against a doctor or against health personnel who do  entertain those religious or philosophical beliefs. rather than to allow that view on the part of the institution itself to affect the individual liberty of the individuals who may  agree. question: should there be a proper discrimination clause in this amendment. second. should  the fact that the hospital or other institution entertains this policy be very open and public. so that. for example. a woman is  going to dash into such a hospital without ice that the hospital will  do what she may want done. and therefore she would be able to help herself by seeking assistance elsewhere. so i would like to address those points to the senator from idaho. i have drafted amendments on that score. which may be desirable. assuming that the senate may well adopt this amendment. to make these two provisions respecting its form. finally. i would be less than fair to my friend and colleague. for whom i have great respect. if i did  say that to me. without in any way anticipating how i shall vote on the matter. it would cause me much less pain on constitutional grounds if the institutional reference were eliminated. i could see it respecting philosophy or the religion of any other person engaged in giving care. and i would  want to punish a hospital or other institution because it employed or had on its staff such personnel. but i am deeply concerned on constitutional grounds when we make it institutional and provide that hospitals or other institutions may prescribe this form of treatment. with respect to the religious views or philosophical viewsbecause we have added the words "or moral conviction." which broadened it considerably"of the person or group sponsoring or administering such hospital or other institution." it is  easy. i k people have shied away from this debate in all states of the union. but etheless. the fact is that we have passed an effective law in the state of new york. and the supreme court. in what i consider to be one of its most historic and constructive adjudications. has laid down the rules regarding this matter in its own decision. i felt it necessary to speak rather than just let this amendment go by. which would have been easy to do because there seems to be a feeling that when you get into hot subjects like this that it is better to let them go by and  discuss them. i do  feel that way. the supreme court has spoken. and the supreme court has made a fair disposition of the case. with the greatest respect for the religious views of a large body of americans. i would hope that settled the question. i believe it does. i certainly go with the supreme courts decision. but here is yet aher aspect of it which has been raised by the amendment of the senator from idaho which is  covered directly on point by the decision. i felt it my duty as a senator and as a lawyer. coming from a state that has legalized abortion. to raise these constitutional issues for the information of my colleagues and the ultimate utilization by the court of last resort. i reserve the remainder of my time.
fine. it will read "religious beliefs or moral conviction regarding." i modify my amendment to read that way. on page 2. section 8 would be an addition. hing is changed in senator churchs amendment. except that this addition is included: in respect of a hospital or other health care institution referred to in section 7that is. senator churchs amendmentsuch hospital or other health care institution shall  discriminate in the employment. promotion. extension of staff or other privileges or termination of employment of any physician or other health care personnel on the basis of their personal religious or moral convictions regarding abortion or sterilization or their participation in such procedures. i wish to make it clear that that particular amendment simply will protect anybody who works for that hospital against being fired or losing his hospital privileges if he does  agree with the policy of the hospital and goes elsewhere and does what he wishes to do. but he can do it in that hospital. and senator church is right about that. there. the hospital controls.
this is section 9: any individual. hospital or other health care institution declining to participate in such procedures on the grounds of such religious or moral convictions shall post ice of such policy in a public place ii such institution
 i am the author of the amendment so perhaps i should answer. in the first place. it is  imposing a duty on any hospital except the hospital seeking to qualify for federal funds. then it says that withstanding that. the hospital may participate in the program. that is the affirmative benefit. but it qualifies the benefit by saying that if they do discriminate against the doctor who is in their hospital because he has done something they do  approve of in the other hospital. we have the authority to deprive them of that benefit.
these are federal benefits under a federal program which some may get and some may  get. depending on many forms of qualification. one form may be the range of hospital services. the senator from idaho provides. and i agree. that the particular hospital does have to give the same range of medical benefits as any other hospital. i say. very well. they still get the money if they do . but suppose that hospital fires a doctor because they do  approve of what he did in aher hospital. i say they do  have the right to fire him. and they may lose the benefits of federal funds because they are discriminating against a doctor. so you have two conditions.
. although the committee is confronted with a monumental legislative "logjam"--there are more than 50 expiring provisions of the phs act alonei believe this measure which provides legislative authority for the regulation of products considered to be medical devices deserves prompt action. the medical device safety act will assure medical and scientific safeguards essential to protecting the health of all our citizens. i ask unanimous consent to have the bill. letter of transmittal from the department of health. education. and welfare. and a summary of the key provisions of the bill printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i am pleased to join senators percy and mondale in the introduction of a bill to extend for 2 years the special project grant authority of the maternal and child health program of title v of the social security act. although the states were to assume responsibility for special project grants beginning july 1972pursuant to the 1967 amendments to the social security act which reorganized title v and provided for formula. special project. and research and training grantscongress extended the authority for the special project grants for 1 year through june 1973. the extension was the result of a report by the comptroller general which pointed out that many states would  have the funds to continue projects which are  operating successfully. and that neither the federal agency  the states had made plans for the transition. there are still serious problems in carrying out the formula grant provisions. a major proportion of the funds for special project grants has been concentrated in few states principally for projects in urban areas with little or health care resources. this. of course. is consistent with the intent of congress. however. the formula by which funds are distributed to the states provides for a distribution weighted in favor of rural states having low per capita incomes. these states would naturally benefit by the distribution of greater resources through the formula grants. consequently. there is way of assuring that cities which  have several projects. will have the resources to maintain these activities. thus. many programs will be eliminated or significantly reduced. when comparing the maternal and child health formula fund in the 1974 budget estimate. with the formula and project grant funds in 1973. new york state suffers a loss of $7.979.200 because of the unfair allocation formula. in 1973. under the formula grant and project grant provisions. the total funding was $15.480.000 for new york. in 1974. new york would receive only $7.501.200. because project grants were "foldedin" to the unfair 1935 formula state allocations. it should be pointed out that this is  the result of any reduction in appropriations. maternal and child health is  one of the activities designed to be phased out or significantly reduced by the administration. indeed the fiscal year 1974 appropriation request is $244 nillion. an increase of $5 million over the 1972 appropriation. the evidence supports my belief that title v projects represent one of the best investments in the federal health care dollar. in 1968. the cost per registrant was slightly more than $200 whereas in 1970. the cost per registrant is below $150. this compares most favorably to the cost per child covered under title xix. approximately $300 per child. it should also be pointed out that services under title v are comprehensive and coordinated and include additional benefits  available under title xix such as nutritional services and various social services.
. on march 30. 1973. our distinguished colleague from colorado addressed an eastern regional conference of the american association of foundations for medical care in white sulphur springsone of a series of six such conferences being held by that association to stimulate and guide local medical societies in setting up foundations or comparable mechanisms which may ultimately qualify as professional standards review organizations in their respective areason the importance of pervasive peer review to insure quality health care for all americans. i would agree with the theme of senator dominicks remarks regarding the recent enactment into law of psro legislationpublic law 92603the result of the imagination and devotion of our colleague. the senator from utah -"as an opportunity rather than a burden" for the medical profession. however. i am  convinced that the medical professions peer review performance will eliminate the need for further federal efforts to rationalize the health care delivery system. senator dominicks remarks also clearly define the challenge and the opportunity presented to the medical profession in regard to the critical problem of the use of human subjects in madical research. mjy deep concern about this complex issue is reflected by my introduction of a protection of human subjects bill and a companion bill to stimulate medical schools leadership in the fields. 974. which i introduced with senator williams. the need for protecting the rights of human subjects at risk in research has been documented in the recent series of hearings by the health subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfare. the need for medical school involvementas the first link in this complicated chain of human eventsis evidenced by senator dominicks remarks. he states: the logical place for beginning the kind of preparation necessary. to deal with the complex implications of new medical techogy would seem to be the medical schools. yet a recent survey indicates very little of this is being done. about 42 percent of the young physicians sampled were  aware of the ethicalsocial problems involved in the development of new medical techogy. and in using human subjects for research. about 86 percent had never attended a lecture or seminar dealing with such questions during medical school. i think it would serve the interests of the medical profession to persuade the medical schools that this situation should be remedied. i join senator dominick in commending the efforts of foundation leaders to meet this challenge and i ask unanimous consent that the text of senator dominicks address be printed in the record.
. as one who has played a role in the senate passage of s. 1136. the omnibus extension of the public health service actwhich encompasses authorizations for regional medical programsi would commend to the attention of my colleagues an article which appeared on the front page of todays new york times by harold m. schmeck. jr.. entitled "congress fights for regional health aid." the newspaper story by mr. schmeck discusses the decision on whether regional medical programs are to be continued. while it is good to k that the regional medical program project which provides for a regional kidney transplant program between new york and new jersey may survive because financial resources will be available to it under congress enacted medicare reimbursement. it is most distressing to learn that a vitally needed demonstration program for controlling high blood pressure and improving mortality from stroke in harlem must terminate because of the zero budget request for regional medical programs. i shall do my utmost to keep this program going. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the article entitled "congress fights for regional health aid" be printed in the record.
. a recent thoughtful editorial in the syracuse heraldjournal focused public awareness on the complex critical issues which confront the congress in responding to the serious problem of human subjects at risk in biomedical research. the heraldjournal editorial entitled "rights of the helpless" gives careful and serious consideration to the subject and supports two measures i authoreds. 878 and s. 974to confront the problem. the editorial states: senator jacob k. javits. new york republican. has proposed legislation to apply guidelines for all hew research grants. we agree. he would set up special funds for medical school courses on clinical research ethics. we also agree. i commend this editorial on the need for congressional action on the rights of human subjects at risk in medical research and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the editorial entitled "rights of the helpless" be printed in the record.
. a recent editorial in the unionsun & journal addressed itself to the substantive issues involved in the regional medical program. one of the many health authorities encompassed in the recent senatepassed omnibus extension of expiring health programs. s. 1136. the editorial praises the accomplishments of the lakes area regional medical program which embraces niagara. erie. allegany. cattaraugus. chautauqua. genesee. and wyoming counties in new york. as well as erie and mckean counties in western pennsylvania. the lakes area regional medical program is one of six regional medical programs in new york state. the others being the albany rmp. the central new york rmp. the nassausuffolk rmp. the new york metropolitan rmp. and the rochester rmp. the achievements of the lakes area rmp discussed in the editorial evidence why. as i have previously indicated when the senate considered s. 1136. the nation must continue the services of the regional medical programs. whatever may be the shortcomings of the rmpsas alleged by the administrationthe nation can afford its preemptory termination. and. congress must determine how the programs mission should be reoriented to make rmps even more effective in providing and developing high quality health care for all americans. i commend the editorial entitled "a threat to medical care" to the attention of senators and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
may i say to my distinguished colleague from wisconsin. if i still have aher minute remaining. that the people who are hit the heaviest are the same people who are paying higher prices at the food counters. at the clothing counters. and for medical care. and i want to give them some hope of seeing an end to it. i would hope under government control. the only way they can do it is that i hope the president has the wisdom to see that phase iii was a great mistake. that he should have a phase iv which should be a phase ii. and that is the only way to get at this situation.
. i am introducing today at the request of the administration a bill to extend indefinitely the authority of section 304 of the public health service act and authorize such sums as necessary for activities to be carried out each fiscal year under that authority. although the programs carried out under section 304 are basic to the achievement of the departments health services goals and objectives. i am  convinced at this time that the congress should establish this authority on a permanent basis. at the time of its enactment (public law 90174). it was broadly drawn and when extended (public law 91515). additional authority was provided by congress to develop health care systems and report on the cost and adequacy of various pending national health insurance legislative proposals. it is interesting to e that without such a specific legislative mission. provided by congress. that the department did  on its own initiative respond to the critical problem of national health insurance. whether the department of health. education. and welfare has mounted an effective attack on the many problems facing the organization. delivery. and financing of health services in the nation. pursuant to the legislative mandate of section 304. must be carefully analyzed by congress before its authority is extended indefinitely. we must carefully examine any broadly drawn legislation. particularly that which would turn over indefinitely to the executive the ability to exercisewithout congressional inputthe determination of national health policy and priorities. a major element of the administrations health policy is the maintenance of a strong health services research and development program. under section 304. the national center has taken the lead in supporting research and development which have the potential to result in widespread benefits in future health services. among these efforts are experimental medical care review organizations. which have been testing the feasibility of the professional standards review organization concepts recently authorized by public law 92603. the cooperative federal/state/local health statistics system. which will provide more complete and accurate information for planning. managing. financing health services. experiments with new types of manpower and techogy. and development of inative organized programs for ambulatory care. the chronically ill. and the elderly which will increase the effectiveness of care without unreasonable increases in costs. while the national center for health services research and development administers section 304. the extensive benefits of this authority are made available to many other federal health programs through close collaboration among the center and the other programs. in the present fiscal year the national center is maintaining joint activities with 17 other programs. including the national institute of mental health. social and rehabilitation service. social security administration. veterans administration. and the department of defense. under section 304. both highly targeted r. & d. projectssuch as experimental medical care review organizations and the cooperative federal/state/local health statistics systemand longrange basic research. such as the study of criteria for the measurement of the health status of individuals and populations. are supported. this is possible. because section 304 is  limited as to disease categories. special population groups or isolated elements of the health services system. furthermore. section 304 authorizes the use of both grants and contracts to support projects. the only limitation being that grants can be awarded to profitmaking organizations. this flexibility permits r. & d. to be specifically directed to high priority problems by contracts. while leaving the grant to be used to support longer range and more generic research to be supported in universities and other profit institutions by grants. i commend the maintenance of a strong health services research and development program. at the same time. i urge careful congressional analysis to insure that the intent of congress is. and will continue to be accomplished. if the authority is extended indefinitely. i ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal and a copy of the bill be printed in the record.
s budget requests the appropriations necessary to meet these commitments. it is the administration position that there are authorizations for the appropriation of funds for continuation grants and contracts under the special drug abuse programs contained in part d of the community mental health centers act. i would e that section 261 (b) authorizes such sums as may be necessary for "projects under part c or d." this bill proposes to use the authority contained in section 410 of the drug abuse office and treatment act to meet commitments under these programs and assure that there is adequate authority for the appropriation of the funds necessary to do this while at the same time providing assistance to the other activities supported under section 410. however. i am concerned that the special action office was established to serve as a coordinating body in the executivewith its grants and contract authority provided by congress for limited special purposes for involvement in grants daytoday administration. i ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal and a copy of the bill be printed in the record.
. my dedication to reform and improvement of the health care delivery system by the development of hios was expressed in detail in the text of my prepared remarks in support of amendment  122which i will   call up in view of the recent developments. but i ask unanimous consent that such prepared remarks be printed in the record at this point.
. taking senator dominicks arguments. as i think we should. at face value. without challenging the factual situation which he presents. we have to make a decision. we have to make a decision whether we wish to sustain the federal system in respect to this particular matter. withstanding that it thwarts a great national reform. or whether we wish to use the national power which is available for exactly that purpose. to be used when we consider it desirable. in order to effectuate that great national reform. we have done it in many areas. we have often overruled state laws. we have often preempted state laws. but the burden is upon us. senator kennedy and myself. to prove that it should be done in this particular case. i am deeply convinced that it has to be done. otherwise we are absolutely thwarted in any effort to bring the cost of medical care within reason. so. as i say. i am  challenging senator domnicks factual presentation. and there may be some senators who feel that the preservation of the right of each state to write whatever laws it chooses on this subject is so sacred that withstanding my deep conviction that it will thwart any kind of national health effort that can be effected. they still want to maintain that right of a state to do as it pleases in this area. i can quarrel with that. but for myself. i do  feel that way. i feel that it is antithetical to the interests of freedom and the success of our country to take that position. but i do  feel that there are high moral grounds on which anyone can pontificate. my reasons i have explained to the senate. and it is for those reasons that i believe the bill should be passed.
yes. they do  have to match it. in the sense of 5050. or 9010. but it takes a big investment to establish an hmo. they can do so on what they will get under this bill. they will have to find the credit. they will have to find the subscribers and the backers and the necessary physicians and other health professionals. they are  going to be able to go into this just on the-
. the enactment into law of the comprehensive alcoholism. prevention. treatment and rehabilitation act of 1970public law 91616which this bill s. 1125. which we are  debating. seeks to extendmarked a critical turning point in the way the american people chose to deal with alcoholism. which former health. education. and welfare secretary richardson called one of the most tragic. destructive. and costly illnesses in the nation today. it also marked the end of a legislative struggle which began in 1966 when i introduced the first alcoholism bill with senator moss of utah. this historic law established a national commitment to combat alcoholism as an ackledged illness which needs to be treated on the basis of medical care. research. and rehabilitation. rather than on the revolvingdoor basis of a police station. which unfortunately was. and too frequently still is. the only form of treatment available. in order effectively to reduce the incidence of alcoholism throughout the nation. this historic law coordinated all federal programs and provided extensive federal assistance to state and local programs in order to promote effective treatment and rehabilitation programs for alcoholics throughout the country. this bill. s. 1125. will permit us to move forward with a coordinated alcoholism treatment and rehabilitation program. having achieved this great milestone in alcoholism prevention. treatment. research and education. we must continue our effort to insure that our endeavors have  been in vain. the problems of alcohol abuse and alcoholism are going to require our continuing total commitment as a nation. i would urge senators to support the comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act amendments of 1973 . this measure will insure the continuing commitment at the federal level to maintain the foundation for a new era in alcoholism treatment. we must all 206}47 join in shaping the policies. changing the attitudes. and generating the programs that will help to reduce the plight of alcoholics in the united states. these millions of unfortunate victims will benefit from our mutual concern. and all of the american people will be the ultimate beneficiaries. it is most appropriate that the senate is considering the comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act amendments of 1973 today when the third annual alcoholism conference of the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism is taking place in washington. d.c. the conference will focus on two themes: "alcoholism: a multilevel problem" and "treatment: planning and organization." i believe the conference program will be of great value in combating alcoholism at the national level and ask unanimous consent that the program of the third annual alcoholism conference of the national institute cn alcohol abuse and alcoholism be printed in the record.
. this is a conference report dealing with the establishment. through collective bargaining. of plans for the giving of legal services to workers. one of the main problems we had in this connection in the conference related to the choice of such plans by workers that is. whether it should be a closed panel. which means lawyers within a given plan. or an open panel. which means that the worker is going to get his own lawyer and the plan is to pay for it. our general intention was to make both available through collective bargaining. rather than to limit it to either one. we spelled out that intention in language. as the senator who moved that the senate recede with an amendment. i think that our intention should be clear in respect of the legislative histoiy we are making here. unions and employers will have the same freedom that they  have in setting up medical and hospital plans. to establish closed panel or open panel plans. i respectfully ask my colleague. the senator from new jersey who chaired the conference and led the senate conferees. if this is his understanding of the provisions we drafted.
s veto. the bill is the result of mutual dedication by the house of representatives and the senate to achieve the most effective and appropriate means to improve our nations ability to provide emergency medical services.
ial commission having within its purview the identification of ethical principles which should underline the conduct of biomedical research involving human subjects and then develop policies and regulations to assure that such research is carried out according to the highest possible standards. the whole world is entering into  only psychosurgery but also organ transplants and so many other disease experimental treatment and diagtic procedures. and the question of who shall live and who shall die. which doctors have to make and families have to make. that. coupled with what we discovered about human subject experimentation in the tuskegee syphilis study. induced me to introduce the legislation which in great measure is incorporated into the pending bill. essentially. title ii of this bill carries it through in three ways: the guideline concept. second. the interim provision until the commission actually operates. which was the subject of the bill i had introduced. and. third. the opportunity to establish in medical schools programs which would provide increased emphasis on the ethical social. legal. and moral implications of advances in biomedical research and techogy. the third point was also included in the bill. s. 974. i introduced along with the senator from new jersey . the bill is extremely desirable. i think it is indispensable for the reasons i mentioned. and also for the reasons i mentioned i favor this amendment which is proposed by the senator from maryland.
i would like to take the last part first. if i may. because what the senator said is touching and moves me so deeply. of course. i can conceive the operation of this bill shutting off that opportunity to the family or the individual patient. the whole premise of the amendment is based heavily on the testimony of the director of the national institute of mental health. as shown on page 14 of the committee report. dr. brown testified that he considered it to be an experimental procedure which. if done. should only be done under the most wellcontrolled circumstances. he testified on the need for peer review to be sure that the quality of medical practice was consistent with the highest possible standards. it has been mentioned here that what we are trying to curb. in the context of the protection of human subjects act. is irresponsible use of experimental techniques. and the heavy emphasis is on the word "irresponsible." there is  the slightest desire  any reason why there should be any inhibition imposed by law in such a situation or anything analogous to it.
yes. only in federal facilities. it gives us a chance to catch our breath and have a look. the other thing about my statement on who shall live and who shall die had relation to psychosurgery but only transplants. as regrettable as it is to all of us. we do  have egh hearts. kidneys. eyes. and other organs. so the doctor is placed in a terrible bind. the legislation i have introduced was in the hope of trying to find some answer.
. i introduce the administrations "food processing establishment registration act." which would provide increased protection for consumers from the shipment of unfit and adulterated food. the health subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfareon which i am the ranking miity memberhas just concluded hearings on legislation to require the food and drug administration to conduct surveillance programs to detect and prevent adulterated food from reaching the marketplace and to provide for the mandatory registration of food processing establishments. at these hearings. the administration testifiedlloyd b. tepper. m.d.. associate commissioner for science. food. and drug administration. public health service. department of health. education and welfarein support of senator kennedys amendment to provide for the mandatory registration of food processing establishments. also. there was unanimous support of all witnessesindustry and consumer groupsas to the need for the mandatory registration of food processing establishments. the bill i introduce today for the administration is intended to accomplish that objective and differs only in matters of perfecting technical detail from senator kennedys amendment. a summary of the billdesigned to assist the food and drug administration in protecting the public against adulterated and misbranded foodand the department of health. education. and welfares views on how this bill would be implemented are set forth in detail in the letter of transmittal by secretary weinberger. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and secretary weinbergers letter of transmittal be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. with the majority leaders consent. i ask unanimous consent that after the vote has been taken on the emergency medical services bill tonight. we will immediately proceed to vote on the bill  before the senate.

i am gratified to e that the house appropriations committee reported h.r. 11575. the defense appropriations bill which contained provisions and recommendations for the continued operation of st. albans naval hospital in new york city. as stated by the house committee. it would be a waste of government funds  to keep this medical facility open and available to eligible persons in the new york area. this has  been approved by the house of representatives. i am strongly for keeping st. albans hospital open. which serves the largest concentration of retirees and active military personnel in the nation. the medical facilities of new york state are so strained  that it would be impossible to load new responsibilities on existing facilities. therefore. i certainly support the action already taken and trust that the senate appropriations committee would similarly support it. i ask unanimous consent that a letter from senator buckley and myself urging the committee to support the house action be printed in the record.
. when there is kn cause of  preventive measure for the largest killer disease of infants. i believe we must establish an appropriate national commitmenta commitment adequately to fund appropriate biomedical research and develop appropriate information and counseling services which will allow us to respond humanely to families who lose children to sids. the scope of the problem of "crib death." as the sudden infant death syndrome is often called. is the unexpected demise of an infant  kn to have had a serious disease and whose death remains unexplained after complete autopsy. based upon findings from several epidemiologic studies. both in the united states and abroad. it appears that the mortality rate from sids is about 3 per 1.000 live births. in this country. we estimate that some 7.000 to 10.000 infants die each year as a result of this syndrome. which is the leading cause of death in infancyup to 1 yearafter the first month of life. in the majority of cases. the baby is apparently in good health and feeds without difficulty. while there may be evidence of a slight cold or stuffy e. there is usually history of a serious upper respiratory infection. often. the infant is placed in his or her crib for a nap or for the night. and several hours later is found dead. the department of health. education. and welfare testified there was approximately $4.1 million in hew supported research related to sids. however. only $603.575. 11 research grants and contracts. are specifically concerned with sids. unless there is focused. concentrated. continuing biomedical research and the cause and cure for this disease is found. thousands of families will continue to suffer the tragedy of suddenly losing an apparently healthy baby. at the same time. the hearing record is replete with examples of family ordeals because of sids. horrible experiences. beyond the tragedy of losing their child to sids. were recounted as parents told of being jailed before the cause of death of their child was diaged as sids. this can be allowed to continue and can be substantially reduced by providing the necessary counseling information and public education and statistical efforts respecting sids and by providing assurances that law enforcement and medical personnel will receive adequate training in the diagis of sids and in how to deal with the tragedy of parents losing such an infant. i urge my colleagues to support this bill which authorizes a total of $36 million over 3 years: $24 million to carry out research programs on sids and $12 million to establish the necessary public and professional informational and educational pro-.rams. this bill will allow us to move coherently toward the goal of understanding the causes of sids and dealing with the resulting problems of this tragic disease.
. in the social security amendments of 1972. it was agreed that the recent medical miracle procedureskidney dialysis and kidney transplantswould be translated into patient care as quickly as possible. the most effective geographical distribution of the dialysis and treatment centers necessary for the delivery of such care would be assured through regulations promulgated by the social security administration. in the state of new york. the mount sinai medical center and the elmhurst general hospital have evolved an excellent program for transplant/dialysis. indeed. the mount sinaielmhurst program is the only major one serving the 2 million people of queens. i understand this combined program accounts for the third largest number of patients treated by such centers in the nation and it has the capacity to perform 50 kidney transplants a year. unfortunately. this has  been possible because of the unavailability of do kidneys. and because of financial difficulties. additionally. with the facilities of a queens satellite clinic. a 24hour program currently provides dialysis treatments for 230 patients with plans to expand in a year to 350. the program is supported by a large staff. and an intensive training program which has been in progress for over 15 years. considerable concern has been expressed whether this excellent program will be phased out. because of the complexity of the standards upon which a decision will be based as to the number and location of such centers and i have communicated to the secretary of health. education. and welfare my interest in this matter. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a copy of an article prepared for publication in the mount sinai news. which i have forwarded to the secretary. outlining the work of these two medical institutions on behalf of patients afflicted with renal disease.
. i should like to address a question to the distinguished manager of the bill which relates to an item dealing with american schools and hospitals abroad. i ice the fact that the figure has been cut almost 50 percent. the traditional approach to this matter has been that we have generally provided about $20 million. also. i e that there is a limitation of  more than four institutions in the same country who may be benefited. i might tell the senator that this limitation to strike probably goes more strongly to what has happened in israel to the various institutions there. i would therefore greatly appreciate it if the chairman would give us the rationale for the cut and the limitation.
. a recently completed hewsponsored health services research project. which examined state legal factors related to hmos indicated the need for such a provision. it shows that the state legal barriers to hmo formation are associated with an absence of hmos in those states which have such barriers. the most powerful legal barriers relate to required physician control and the requirement that participation in any one hmo in a state be open to every physician in that state. this latter requirement. of course. removes the ability of the hmo to exercise the necessary discipline over excess utilization of services. in the states where barriers do  exist. the hmo movement has definitely shown substantial growth. in those states where legal barriers to hmos are most stringent. hmos have  formed. and 20 states do  have a single hmo. the need to preempt state legal barriers is further reinforced by that analysis. which shows that the states that have recently passed hmo enabling legislation have varied so much in their approach that they are in effect creating a new set of legal barriers. particularly to multistate or regional hmos. i did  understand how hew reasonably could support a position directly contrary to its own cited study conclusion. the hew position was further challenged by recent newspaper stories charging that the reversal of prior support for preemption of state laws is in great measure due to ama lobbying. past and present. according to then secretary of hew richardsons testimony. and i quote: state laws often hamper hmo development. many states impose legal restrictions on hmo development which will have to be overcome. such as licensure of health professionals and sponsorship of hmos. twentyone states have even more restrictive laws. in some instances. requiring hmos to operate under rules applicable to blue shield plans or insurance companies. since hmos operate in a different fashion from either of these. such laws make it difficult for hmos to organize. the preemption of restrictive state laws was clearly our responsibility and the conference substitute provides:
. i urge the senate to support the "national diabetes research and education act." an original bill reported by the senate committee on labor and public welfare--of which i am the ranking miity memberwhich combines and incorporates the best features of diabetes legislation carefully considered by the committee. the needs of diabetic patients in the united states are  being met at the present time and i believe these needs can be met in the future unless the federal government expands its leadership role in this area and provides the financial support that is essential to combatting the problems related to diabetes. diabetes mellitus is a major health problem in the united states. the disease afflicts approximately 5.000.000 ameriicans and there are about 325.000 new cases of diabetes diaged each year. it is the fifth leading cause of death from disease. and 35.000 deaths are attributed to it annually. diabetes is the real underlying cause of many thousands of deaths that are officially counted under the heading of "heart disease." "stroke." and "kidney disease." it is the second leading cause of new cases of blindness. and it produces blindness almost 20 years earlier than the leading cause of blindness. the complications of diabetes mellitus lead to many other serious health problems and uncontrolled diabetes significantly shortens life expectancy. to establish the appropriate national commitment to launch an attack on diabetesone of the most important chronic diseases that afflicts mankindthe bill provides: first. a task force to develop a plan to combat diabetes under the national institute of health is established in hew. the plan to be developed within 9 months. will include research. drug development. field studies. manpower training and data analyses. second. the task force is to be composed of 10 persons6 experts and 4 consumers2 of whom must be parents of children with diabetesand $500.000 is authorized for the task force. third. the arthritis institute at nih is also required to establish a prevention and control program to combat diabetes and $17.5 million over 3 years is authorized for this purpose. fourth. the arthritis institute is required to establish research and training centers of excellence throughout the united states and $45 million is authorized for this purpose over 3 years. i urge my colleagues to support s. 2830 and provide the necessary fundinga total of $63 million over 3 yearsto assure the federal government mounts an effective attack on diabetes and establishes the necessary coordinated research effort in the field of diabetesas well as in the closely related fields of metabolism and endocriogy from which much of the newer kledge concerning the mechanisms underlying the disease is expected to evolve.
. i am proud to join with senator cranston and senator williams in the development and introduction of the "national arthritis act." according to the most recent statistics. approximately 20.000.000 americans are afflicted with arthritismost requiring medical careand the majority of rheumatoid arthritis victims are young and middle aged adults in their most productive years. between 20 and 45 years of age. in addition to the human pain and suffering caused by arthritis its ecoic dimensions are staggering. the annual cost to the nation due to medical care bills and lost wages caused by arthritis is $9.2 billion. i am concerned that the needs of victims of arthritisa major health problem in the united statesare  being met at the present time and i believe these needs can be met in the future unless the federal government expands its leadership role in this area. we must provide the financial support that is essential to combating arthritis and unnecessary crippling. to establish a national commitment to launch an attack on arthritis the bill provides: first. a national task force is established to develop a plan to combat arthritis. the plan to be developed within 9 months. will include prevention and control studies. research and data analyses. field studies. health manpower training. screening programs and home care policies. second. the task force is to be composed of 16 eminently qualified persons including at least 2 who are victims of arthritis. and $500.000 is authorized for the task force. third. the arthritis institute at nih is also required to establish a screening. early detection and control program to conbat arthritis. and $30 million over 3 years is authorized for this purpose. fourth. the arthritis institute is required to establish research and demonstration centers of excellence throughout the united states and $45 million is authorized for this purpose over 3 years. i believe this bill will provide the necessary fundinga total of $75.5 million over 3 yearsto assure the federal government mounts an effective attack on arthritis. by mr. johnston (by request):
 to continue his commitment to the conquest of cancer. evidenced by his signing into law the "national cancer act of 1971" and by his 1971 state of the union message where he said: the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.
the only other modification i was going to suggest to the senator is what has been pretty much the rubric in these matters. to save the life or to protect the health of the mother. but i have to leave that to the senator. in view of the fact that we are under strict rules regarding other amendments than the one the senator has proposed.
. the bill i introduce today for myself and senators eagleton and williams. the urban hospital emergency assistance act of 1974. is designed to breathe life into a badly deterioratingperhaps perishing for fiscal reasonsbut critically important element of the nations health care delivery systemour overburdened urban public hospitals. these great institutions provide the bulk of inpatient and outpatient care for. the millions of poor. uninsured. medically indigent. and disadvantaged citizens in cities across america. the urban public hospital is nationally recognized as the provider of service to all in need of health care. regardless of their ecoic status. they are community institutions practicing high quality medicine. but their quality care is  publicly recognized and they are stigmatized as facilities for the poor. and the affluent avoid using them because of this stigma. i will go on to analyze the historic causes for our twotrack hospital health care system and its resultant fiscal plight for our public hospitals. but it does regrettably exist. i believe we have the responsibility to provide emergency support to insure public hospital survival and. at the same time. the impetus for change. the bill i introduce today would accomplish these goals: first. $500 million over 3 years is authorized for grants to public general hospitals which meet specified criteria for modernization and outpatient activities. with a specific exclusion against using the grants for expansion of bed capacity. the immediate dire financial straits of our public hospitals are recognized by the provision for a grant priority where the assistance sought is to either eliminate or prevent an imminent safety hazard or avoid loss of the hospitals licensure or accreditation. but the hospital must first establish to the secretarys satisfaction. that the failure to overcome such serious problems can be achieved without federal assistance. second. $110 million is authorized over 3 years for grants to public and private profit hospitals to demonstrate inations in health care delivery construction. applicants must demonstrate how such grants would implement quality control or eliminate documented operational inefficiencies in the provision of health services to patients. third. $300 million is authorized over 3 years as an entitlement to public hospitals. which derive 15 percent of their operating expenses from local governments general revenues. the entitlement would be in the form of a grant equal to 75 percent of "annual net cost of patient care".  otherwise reimbursed by medicare. medicaid. or other third party insurers. and require that to be eligible for such grant. it be established that without such federal assistance the local unit of government would otherwise be required to provide general revenue funding. the total operating expenses of a hospital are included in the term "annual net cost of patient care." but such cost can be more than the costs of the most efficient institutional provider of health care in the community which is providing an equivalent range of services. and it is less the amounts received by the hospital from patients. or third party payors on the patients behalf. for such care. but excludes from such reduction. first. payments from general revenues by local units of government or by other public agencies in support of the hospital or specifically for the care of lowincome or medically indigent persons. second. payments by the secretary under title vi of this act. and third. charitable contributions to the hospital. fourth. $150 million is authorized over 3 years as an entitlement to public and profit private hospitals which adopt uniform cost accounting. utilization and reporting systems and procedures for training residents. interns. and individuals preparing for careers in nursing or the allied health professions in approved programs except citizen foreign medical graduates. each hospital would receive the lesser of the product of $500 multiplied by the number of patient beds in such hospital. or $500.000. urban public hospitals serve as the family doctor. specialist. nurse. and counselor. their specialty services are available to the entire community. and they have been among the leaders of medicine in provision of emergency services. drug abuse. and alcoholism treatment. and burn and trauma centers. there is generally other resource. public hospitals pioneered in the establishment of ambulatory care programs long before the term became popular. their outpatient clinics. while often overcrowded and understaffed with overworked and dedicated physicians. nurses. and other health personnel. have long provided leadership in the development of maternal and child health programs. in cancer detection. heart and stroke prevention and rehabilitation. and in health education and family planning. as teaching hospitals. urban public hospitals offer opportunities for vitally needed residency training. internships. nurse training. and other health profession programs. ranging from basic aid and technical training to highly specialized postgraduate medicine. unfortunately. these important health care functions are provided through a system that has historically distinguished between private medical care for the affluent and public care for the ecoically disadvantaged. in the early days of our nations history. care for the destitute was in hospitals which were never used for the treatment of welltodo patients. only after hospital officials were convinced by men such as lister. pasteur and semmelweiss of the necessity for antisepsis and sterile procedures did hospitals become places to get well. rather than die. and the introduction of anesthesia gave a purpose to the hospitalsurgery. when all this took place. the middle and upper classes began to use hospitals. but they generally used newly built private institutions. thus. the historic separation of care systems originated and persists: private hospitals are seen as places to get well. while public hospitals all too often and wrongly are seen as places to die. after the issuance of the historic flexner report on medical education. the teaching hospital became an essential element of physician training. the poor patient in public hospitalsreceiving free carebecame the experimental material for generations of medical students and in exchange the medical schools provided the medical manpower resource at virtually cost to the hospital. the growth of thirdparty payment systems. while having great impact on the private hospitals. had little effect on the public hospitals. because their patient population had little. or insurance coverage. the public hospitals remained almost totally dependent on local tax revenues while the financial base of the private hospitals gradually shifted. unfortunately. the promises seen for public hospitals through medicaid never became a reality. medicaid initiated the demand for health services. but at the same time proved too expensive for many state governments and they cut back on their commitments. the cutback impacted most severely upon public hospitals which provided the vast majority of care for medicaid patients. the cost of previously paid medicaid health care  must be paid from the local tax base posing an even more serious tax problem. medicaid while excellent as a social tool for itself has  solved the public hospital problem. and the urban poor are still victims of the historical distinction between the public and private health care systems. the public hospitals are in a critical condition. in many cities. the physical plants are obsolete. poorly located. and incapable of supporting quality care. patientstaff ratios are unacceptable. and heavy reliance is placed on the use of medical staff composed of foreign medical graduates. in cities across the country the public hospitals have lost or are threatened with loss of accreditation. several public hospitals are scheduled for closure and the new york city health and hospitals corp. is faced with the need to close or lease a number of its municipal hospitals. we need to take immediate and emergency action to save our public hospitals. the legislation we introduce today is  intended to be permanent.  do we expect it to be a panacea for the ills of the systemills which are historic and rooted in the facts of local property taxation and public attitudes toward the poor. but the temporary infusion of capital and operating support proposed in this measure together with minimal assistance in the cost of training our health manpower may provide a brief respite in the continuing slide of the public hospital system so that we may proceed to the larger public policy issues surrounding health care. confident that we are  too quickly sacrificing a vital resource which may be. after due consideration. retained as a key element of our new national health service delivery structure. one of the most outstanding presentations and analyses of the issues confronting our public hospitals was set forth in an article entitled "public hospitals--critical or recovering." by alice tetelman. formerly a legislative assistant in the office of the former republican senator from new york. charles goodell. i commend the articlewhich highlights the proceedings of five regional conferences sponsored by the council of urban health providers and the health services and mental health administration. january through march 1972written by ms. tetelman to the attention of my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the article and the bill be reprinted in the record.
. i am pleased to join with senator kennedy in the introduction of a bill to amend the phs act to revise the programs of health services research and statistics and to extend the program of assistance for medical libraries. this legislation addresses itself to three important facets of the nations health care problems: first. the need for an increased commitment to health services research aimed at improving the use of our health care dollars. with a strong commitment backing it. health care research will assist in answering fundamental questions about national health insurance. quality of care. effective use of personnel and techogical resources. second. the need for accurate and comprehensive statistics about the nations health. without such information we can never k what benefits we have obtained from the billions of dollars we spend on health  what directions we must take in the future to improve the health of the nation. responsibility for gathering. analyzing. and distribution of this vital information rests with the national center for health statistics. the center has achieved a worldwide reputation as an objective and competent reporter of the health status of the american people. third. the need for funding authority for medical libraries assistance programs. the effectiveness of these programs in the important function of disseminating medical kledge justifies continuing support for this worthwhile investment. the principal modification this legislation makes in these three authorities is that it mandates that the existing hew units which conduct health services research and which gather health statistics be combined into a new national center for health services research and statistics in order to obtain statistics which are responsive to the needs of health services researchers as well as the generally close relationship between health services research and statistic gathering activities. with respect to medical libraries. the only change of substance is the elimination of moneys for the construction of medical libraries which was  funded last year. i believe this legislation will help to insure that the rapid advances in medicine and science will  leave public and professional kledge far behind. by mr. hansen :
. as the congress seeks to insure consumer safety with respect to foods. drugs. cosmetics. and medical devices many of the provisions of the administration bill have been considered. are being considered. or will be considered with respect to medical device. food surveillance. and cosmetic legislation in the respective committees. without passing on the bill itself. i believe the administration is to be commended for its submittal as an earnest advocate of its purposes which seek to protect the public health and to recognize the inadequacy of existing legal authority in crucial areas for example in the federal food. drug. and cosmetic act. the major provisions of the bill follow: first. broaden fdas inspection authority to cover records in food. drug. device. and cosmetic factories. the records would include data on complaints. adverse reactions. product claims. and product composition and processing. second. enable fda to require recordkeeping and reporting for foods. devices. cosmetics. and all drugs including those placed on the market before 1938. third. authorize the issuance of subpenas for witnesses and documentary evidence in matters under investigation by the fda. fourth. authorize the fda to administratively detain violative food products. drugs. devices. and cosmetics for up to 20 days while initiating appropriate legal action. over the years there have been instances where such products have been removed from warehouses. et cetera. before effective action by fda would be taken. fifth. increase fines for criminal violations of the fdc act from $1.000 to $10.000 for first offenses and from $10.000 to $25.000 for each subsequent violation. this action brings these 1938 fines into closer conformity with those imposed by more recent regulatory statutes. sixth. require the labels of prescription drugs to show the quantity of all active ingredients. at the present time. except for a few specified ingredients. prescription drugs are required to list only the names of the active ingredients. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter of transmittal from the department of health. education. and welfare. which explains the necessity and the purpose of the provisions of the bill and the bill. be printed in the record.

s cancer panel provisions in the national cancer act enacted into law as public law 92218. a panel creatively chaired by a distinguished new yorker. benschmidt. the need for this measure is reflected in the administrations proposed budget for 1975. while the national cancer institute and the national heart and lung institute reflect an increase of approx"imately $1 million for 1975. all the other vitally important research institutes of the national institutes of health are increased only $1 million over their 1974 appropriations. i believe our nations biomedical research effort is the finest in the world. if it is to continue to maintain its excellence and leadership in improving the health of the american people. we must assure that it receive adequate funding priorities. this is the goal of the bill i introduce today with senator kennedy. the serious threat which exists for our nations biomedical research program is set forth in a letter to the editor which appeared in the february 17th edition of the washington post. by mr. ribicoff (for himself.
. i recently introduced the "urban hospitals emergency assistance act of 1974" with senators eagleton and williams. as evidence of the importance and need for this legislation. today as a case in point i would like to provide for my colleagues additional factual information concerning new york citys public hospitals. there are 48.000 hospital beds in new york city and 25 percent or 16.000 beds are provided by municipal hospitals. however 80 percent of these 16.000 beds are obsolete. in fact. the old lincoln hospital still uses physical facilities originally built to house runaway slaves. the new york city health and hospitals corp. has a current $840 million construction budget to help correct this physical plant crisis. which involves  just replacement of obsolete beds. but a change in the old open ward system to a more modern care setting in 2- to 6bed rooms. despite this substantial financial commitment 70 percent of the beds in the municipal hospital system will  be replaced and. in some instances. will remain terribly antiquated. the obvious and extensive needs of maintenance and modernization have  yet been met. the physical plants of the new york public hospital system are valued at $1 billion. however. when 4 to 5 percent of this value. or $40 million. is needed each year to prevent deterioration of the facilities alone and only half that amount is made available. obsolescence is an unavoidable barrier to adequate care. about half of the budget must come from thirdparty paymentslargely medicaid and medicarewhen they can be collected. collection requires 30 million pages of paper in an average fiscal year to realize a $300 million return. the mere processing of this monstrous amount of paper costs $20 million in personnel. in the new york city volunteer hospitals. where only 25 percent of the patient population enters through the emergency rooms. there is adequate time to complete paperwork in an orderly manner. on the other hand. threefourths of the public hospital patients are admitted through the emergency service. forcing decisions between providing patient care and processing paper. implied in these figures are other difficulties with reimbursement programs. first. public hospital patients do  generally have insurance coverage. and when they do. it is often insufficient to pay for their care. second. insurance mechanisms do  cover preventive medicine. so to provide the kind of services needed to the millions of people who need them. public subsidies are essential if our public hospitals are adequately to serve the public. this is what my bill. s. 2983. is all about. the bill provides that the covered costs will be shared by the federal government and local governments on a 75/25 basis. and yet the authorization is so modest that the city of new york alone could use it all.
. i urge my colleagues to support the proposed substitute for the house amendment to s. 1745--sudden infant death syndrome act of 1974which i believe that the house will accept. this measure will allow us to begin to establish an appropriate national commitment to adequately fund appropriate biomedical research and develop appropriate information and counseling services to respond humanely to families who lose children to sids. the scope of the problem of "crib death." as the sudden infant death syndrome is often called. is the unexpected demise of an infant  kn to have had a serious disease and whose death remains unexplained after complete autopsy. based upon findings from several epidemiologic studies. both in the united states and abroad. it appears that the mortality rate from sids is -about 3 per 1.000 live births. in this country. we estimate that some 7.000 to 10.000 infants die each year as a result of this syndrome. which is the leading cause of death in infancyup to 1 yearafter the first month of life. in the majority of cases. the baby is apparently in good health and feeds without difficulty. while there may be evidence of a slight cold or stuffy e. there is usually history of a serious upper respiratory infection. often. the infant is placed in his or her crib for a nap or for the night. and several hours later is found dead. this bill authorizes a total of $9 million over 3 years to establish the necessary public and professional informational and educational programs and requires the secretary to report to congress on the research being carried out and the need for additional research funding as it relates specifically to sudden infant death syndrome. i urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we may move aggressively toward the goal of understanding the causes of sids and dealing with the resulting problems of this tragic disease.
. are in its provisions with regard to the organization and designation of state health commissions to perform delineated regulatory functions. the department of health of the state of new york has expressed deep and legitimate concerns about the provisions of h.r. 12053. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the new york state department of health letter and detailed analysis of concerns be printed in the record.
. by request. i am today introducing the administrations "health resources planning act" which would amend the public health service act to revise and extend programs of federal assistance for comprehensive health resources planning. and to assist the states in regulating the costs of health care. the major purposes of this billto assist the nations health care system to plan more effectively to provide the resources necessary to meet the nations health care needs and provide grant assistance to states to pay part of their costs in regulation proposed capital expenditures and rate increases for health careare substantially similar to the "health planning act" measure i recently introduced. in respect to planning activities the bill is designed to replace the state areawide planning components of five programs. conducted under the public health service act. whose authorizations expire with the close of the current fiscal year. these are the comprehensive health planning programs under sections 314(a) and 314(b) of the act. the hillburton program under title vi of the act. the regional medical programs under title ix of the act. the program supporting area health education centersfunded through both the regional medical programs and section 774 of the actand the program assisting experimental health services delivery systems under section 304 of the act. in respect to state regulatory activities on health care planning the bill provides a formula grant program to encourage these activities. and to supply some of the costs to the state attendant upon its participation in the program of capital expenditure review established by section 1122 of the social security act. in this regard. in contrast to views about planning the bill recognizes that regulation of the health care industry is a governmental function. and can appropriately be transferred to private hands. i am concerned that the billand the letter of transmittal from the department of health. education. and welfare makes it cleardoes  propose to extend project grants for health facilities construction. i am  convinced that our urban and public hospital system can survive without such federal assistance. that is why i modified my planning bill to authorize grants. as well as loans. for facilities construction and also introduced with senator eagleton the "urban hospitals emergency assistance act of 1974" . i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter of transmittal. a section by section summary of the bill. and the bill be printed in the recoro.
. the problems of alcohol abuse and alcoholism require our total commitment as a nation and i urge that the "comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act amendments of 1974" be enacted into law.
just to supply the names of the staff who are  improperly often referred to as our brains: lee goldman. staff director of the health subcommittee. and our own miity staff member. jay cutler. miity counsel of the health subcommittee. who have both done very distinguished work in this whole field. . i ask unanimous consent that a description of the committee bill at pages 11 and 12 of the report be printed in the record.
. i recently joined with senators kennedy and magnuson in introducing legislation which proposed modifications in the national health service corps to make it more attractive in recruiting physicians. dentists. and other health professionals to serve in manpower shortage areas. today i introduce. on request. the admininstrations public health and national health service corps scholarship training program amendments of 1974. the administration bill is designed to extend and expand the program of scholarship assistance available to health professionals who will commit themselves to serving in this nations many health manpower scarcity areas. the national health service corps has. since its beginning in 1971. provided for many american communities the only hope of recruiting a physician or other health professional to serve the medical needs of its citizens. today. 3 years after its start. the corps has staffed 183 sites with needed doctors. nurses. and other health professionals. in the near future this program will reach other communities across this nation. an integral part of the recruitment efforts of the corps is the system of scholarship assistance established in 1972 by the emergency health personnel act. under this program. health professionals receive up to 4 years of scholarship and stipend assistance in return for service as a commissioned officer of the public health service or as a civilian member of the national health service corps. the act authorized $3 million for this program for fiscal 1974. this bill would extend and expand this scholarship program to allow students supported under this program to be assigned to any civilian or uniformed federal health program. this bill would: authorize to be appropriated for the program "such sums as may be necessary". extend the program for an indefinite period beyond fiscal year 1974. and authorize assignment of the programs participants to the national health service corps. and "to such other uniformed or civilian federal health service as the secretary may determine is appropriate." i believe the enactment of legislation which would strengthen the national health service corps ability to recruit physicians and other health professionals and at the same time strengthen the ability of medically underserved areas to recruit and retain such health professionals is essential. the bill i introduce today and s. 311. which recently i joined with senators kennedy and magnuson in introducing. are important steps toward assuring an adequate future supply of health professionals for those areas of this country which have in the past been denied needed health care services and i believe the congress should act promptly on these measures to fashion the most effective single bill. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the department of health. education. and welfares letter of transmittal. the bill. and a list of hew designated health manpower shortage areas in new york state. by profession. be printed in the record.
. hemophilia is a chronic blood disease which results in execessive and sometimes fatal bleeding as well as painful and crippling of the joints. elbows. knees. and ankles. during the past year a great deal of national attention has been focused on the ecoic and incredible hardships faced by hemophiliacs and their families. medical research recently discovered a new anticlotting substance which can be injectedmuch like a diabetic injects insulinand which has given hemophiliacs new hope for a longer and more mal life. it is estimated that 25.000 of the 100.000 individuals afflicted with the disease have the severe forms of hemophilia which could be substantially eased with the administration of the anticlotting factor. unfortunately. this treatment is emously expensive with costs ranging from $6.000 to $20.000 per year per patient. in order to assist hemophiliacs who can otherwise afford this expensive treatment. senator harrison williams. my friend and distinguished colleague from new jersey. and the chairman of the labor and public welfare committee. of which i am ranking miity member. introduced legislation which would provide financial aid for the nations hemophiliacs. his bill has won the praise of millions of people throughout the country and i have publicly annced that i am very sympathetic to this measure and that i will do my utmost to help in the matter. most recently. it has been the subject of an excellent article in the washington post and a radio commentary on the cbs network. i would like to commend senator williams for his deep commitment to solving this terrible problem and ask unanimous consent that the text of the washington post article and the transcript of the nick thimmesch "spectrum" commentary be printed in the record.
i today introduce the administrations "national health service corps amendments of 1974." designed to extend and improve the role of the national health service corps in order to assist communities to develop ambulatory health care services by assigning physicians and dentists and providing other initial assistance to manpower shortage areas. the national health service corps represents an exciting and challenging mechanism for placing health professionals in areas with critical health manpower shortages. the national health service corps is in every sense a peoples programlinking health professionals in a very important personal and professional way to communities and to patients with needs and problems. who in many cases have  had other than distant emergency care available for long periods of time. the primary mission of the national health service corps addresses the documented problems of geographic maldistribution of providers. a complementary goal of the corps is to assist these communities to develop the capability independently to attract and retain health professionals. there are three major differences between the administration bill and s. 3181which i recently introduced with senators kennedy and magnusonwhich the administration believes will facilitate independence. first. the department believes the national health service corps should be given more flexibilityand i agreeto deal with cost recovery during initial stages of operation for communities which are beginning practices. today the startup costs for communities is expensive and serves as a disincentive with respect to moving away from federal support. . second. the bill provides authority to make small loans or grants  to exceed $10.000 for preoperatlonal development. such as locating and setting up proper facilities and establishing billing systems. these initial operating debts are currently a disincentive in moving away from federal support and i believe such asssitance. at an increased level. is essential. third. a mechanism for transferring equipment to the profit entities established by the communitieswhich i support--is provided by the bill so that the purchase of equipment for use in the communities is  an impediment to independence. also. the administration bill would authorize such sums as necessary for each of the next 3 fiscal years. the bill i introduce today and s. 3181. which i joined with senators kennedy and magnuson in introducing. are important steps in alleviating the problem of geographic maldistribution of health providers. i am pleased that the department of health. education. and welfare has testified it will work closely with the health subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. in a spirit of cooperation to fashion the most effective measure. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the department of health. education. and welfares letter of transmittal and the bill be printed in the record.
. i am pleased to have worked with senator kennedy in the development and introduction of this legislation (83441. "drug utilization improvement act") which seeks to respond to the serious issuesin respect to the way drugs are used and marketed--developed in 8 days of hearings by the health subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. i believe there is a national need for the free flow of accurate drug information. both to the medical and health professions and to the public so that new advances in science and medicine can be quickly and safely translated into practical applications in the treatment of disease. while i recognize the free market ecoy and the need for marketing activities to make physicians. other health professionals. and the public aware of new drug discoveriesas well as the therapeutic usefulness of existing drugs and substancesthe overwhelming weight of the evidence presented during the hearings leads me to conclude that certain sales practices must be restricted or controlled in the public interest. it is clear that certain sales practices relating to the sampling of drugs and "giveaway" marketing activities have led to unfair practices and inappropriate pressure on the medical and pharmaceutical professions. there is a need to protect against the unnecessary prescribing of therapeutic agents or the choice and use of preparations for other than proper medical or scientific reasons. it is the ultimate responsibility of the practitioner to make the necessary judgments in the drug treatment of disease for his particular patients and the bill seeks to insure both that his treatment will be based on medical and scientific decisions rather than marketing pressures and that his prescribing decisions will be precisely executed by those filling his prescriptions. the bill also seeks to insure that the medical profession and. where applicable. the public receives that to which they are entitled. reasonable and accurate disclosure of the effects of particular drugs and substances available in the marketplace. the bill places the responsibility on those companies producing such products to make available to physicians prescribing such preparations. wholesalers distributing such products. as well as retail pharmacists dispensing such products information which accurately reflects the kn consequences of the use of such drugs  only in their printed promotion but in their personal selling as well. it is to be ed that such concernsto which this bill seeks to respondare shared also by the pharmaceutical manufacturers of america. i understand the drug industry has publicly annced it will seek legislation voluntary complianceto remedy the problems presented. for this the industry is to be commended. although the bill senator kennedy and i have developed to achieve such goals differs from the proposed industry bill. at the beginning of the pharmaceutical industry hearings i made the points: first. that if legislation is developed. the medical profession. industry. and consumer representatives should again have an opportunity to testify on the specific provisions of the legislation. and second. we should focus on such provisions which relate to our primary legislative objective. quality health care. this is precisely what this bill is all about and what the scheduled hearings make clear will happen. the following is a summary of the bill:
. i introduce by request. on behalf of the administration. a bill entitled the comprehensive health manpower act of 1974. i do this today so that the administration bill may have parallel consideration with the bills on the same subject i join in introducing today. i am deeply concerned that the bill sets in motion a departure from existing laws capitation grant program. the health manpower act of 1971 and the nurse training act of 1971 for the first time used a "capitation" approach of providing assistance to health profession schools whereby schools were to receive institutional support based on student enrollmentas an appropriate federal undertaking to provide a stable source of financial support for medical. dental. nursing. and other health profession schools. at the same time i am also deeply concerned because this billproposed by the administrationfails to confront realisticallyas does our health profession education assistance act of 1974 and the nurse training act of 1974. bills i joined in developing and introduced today with senator kennedythe overriding medical manpower problems of shortages and geographic and specialty maldistribution. problems which adversely impact upon the wellbeing and health of millions of americans. i believe the administration bill translates into legislation the health manpower themes of the office of management and budget but fails to meet the health needs of the american people. i am  convinced that where there are $352.300.000 in hew approved and unfunded construction grant applications for schools of the health professions. that we should propose the repeal of construction grant authority. rather than encourage through federal grants. interest subsidies and guaranteed loans the construction of desperately needed medical. dental. nursing. and other health profession schools the bill fails to continue the grant or interest subsidy authority. it merely authorizes a severely limited and redirected loan guarantee program and one which is  applicable to schools of pharmacy and public health. such action may be consistent with an office of management and budget budgetary philosophy of zero budget requests over recent years. it is  consistent with congressional priorities. only last fiscal year the senatepassed appropriations bill provided $120 million for construction grant assistance. i am  convinced we should sharply reduce capitation amounts for medical. osteopathic. and dental schoolsto $1.500 per student from the currently authorized basic capitation amount of $2.850. if one reflects that the $4.000 captation award for graduates. over 3 years phase down to practically zero for schools of optometry. podiatry-$400. $300. and $200 per student for fiscal years 1975. 1976. and 1977 respectively. from the currently authorized basic capitation amount of $800and for veterinary medicine-$900. $600. and $300 per student for fiscal years 1975. 1976. and 1977 respectively from the currently authorized basic capitation amount of $1.750. and wipe out all capitation support at schools of nursing and pharmacy. this is particularly tragic when pursuant to section 205 of the comprehensive health manpower act of 1971. public law 92157. congress has before it the recently completed costs of education in the health professions study by the institute of medicine of the national academy of science which endorses a policy that health professional schools be regarded as a national resource requiring federal support and recommends that the federal government use net education expenditures as a basis for establishing rates of capitation payments to health professional schools. if one chooses to use the capitation amount of 331/3 percent of the average net education expenditures pursuant to such study for purposes of comparison it would provide capitation support for each student enrolled. as follows: medicine --------------------- $3.250 osteopathy --------------------- 2.300 dentistry ---------------------- 2. 450 optometry --------------------- 1.050 pharmacy ------------------------ 1.000 podiatry ------------------------ 1.650 veterinary medicine ---------------- 1. 850 nursing (per student equivalent): baccalaureate ------------------- 800 associate ---------------------- 550 diploma ------------------------ 500 experience suggests that the capitation grant program has improved the financial viability of many health profession educational institutions. for example. financial distress grants. received by onehalf of the nations more than 100 medical schoolswhich necessitated senate passage of my emergency medical and dental schools assistance act of 1969. -has been reduced to only six medical schools receiving such support. that is a substantial drop. such action may be consistent with an office of management and budget budgetary philosophy. it is  consistent with congressional priorities. only last fiscal year the senate passed appropriations bill provided $225.777.000 for capitation grant authority to schools of medicine. osteopathy. dentistry. optometry. pharmacy. podiatry. veterinary medicine. and nursing. i am convinced that where there is an actual shortage of. for example. 30.000 physicians. based on the emperical data. exclusive of the department of health. education. and welfares unconscionable reliance upon citizen foreign medical graduatesfmgsto provide medical manpower. congress should make every appropriate effort to increase our nations medical schools capacity to increase enrollment and train qualified americans to become physicians. my views with respect to the fmg issue are set forth in my january 17 and april 10. 1974 letters to secretary weinberger. i ask unanimous consent that they be printed at this point in the record. along with his response.
. i am  convinced that we can overcome geographic maldistribution of health professionals by relying solely upon a strengthened scholarship program for the national service corpsalthough i commend this effort in the bill and senator kennedy and i have adopted this concept. fathered by senator magnuson. as one facet of our allout attack on the problem in our billand would agree with discontinuing reliance upon loan forgiveness as an irrational approach to the problem. i ask unanimous consent that the conclusions of the may 24. 1974. report to the congress by the comptroller general be printed in the record at this point.
. the bills i introduce today with senator kennedythe health professions educational assistance act of 1974 and the nurse training act of 1974respond to the serious problems of shortages and geographic and specialty maldistribution of physicians. dentists. nurses. and other health professionals which affects the wellbeing of millions of americans.
 i wish to commend donald elisburg. an aide to senator williams. eugene mittelman. my aide. and his assistant. davwid dunn. roger king. who helped senator taft. and bob bahan. who helped senator dominick. for working on the fashioning of this bill. i have every expectation that it will have a good effect. constructive and peacemaking on labormanagement relations in the hospital field. it will be our duty in conference to make the measure go as far as the senate desired. i particularly wish to congratulate my colleague from ohio. senator taft. who took great personal interest and had a lot to do with fashioning the measure we have just passed
. i commend to the attention of my colleagues an article written by dr. amitai etzioni. long kn for his work in the health field. entitled "psro: a poor mechanism and a possible alternative" (commentary: may 1974). the article reflects the kind of analysis which is needed to make the psros more effective or to provide a viable alternative. there is a great potential in the ideas that dr. etzioni puts forth for greater cooperation between the public and private sectors concerned with health care delivery. the suggested approach of forming comprehensive health auditing entities which would review the adequacy of inputs. processes. and outputs of hospital and other health care facilities deserve serious consideration. i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record.
. i am pleased to speak in support of h.r. 11105. which would amend the older americans act relating to the nutrition program for the elderly. which would provide authorization of additional appropriations among other things. the accomplishments of the nutritional programs previously established under the older americans act are well kn. substantial progress has been made in delivering adequate meals to senior citizens at over 4.000 meal sites and there has been a major emphasis by the administration on aging on delivery in these programs. however. there have been some problems that require a greater emphasis on reaching the goal  only of providing adequate nutrition. but improving the participation of the elderly in the socialization and related services offered. it is  just egh to maintain a program such as this for the purposes of feeding the elderly. it is also necessary to bring older people into greater pazticipation with a wider range of activities in their communities. and i would add that in order to accomplish this it is necessary to provide more adequate funds to the nutrition program of the older americans act. the nutrition program is without question one of the most popular programs for senior citizens ever enacted by the congress and with this billwhich will provide more needed funds to expand the programit will become more effective for older americans everywhere. i wish to compliment the prime movers of this bill. senators eagleton. beall. and kennedy. for having taken expeditious action to bring this bill to swift enactment.
. the urgent need for the "health professionals educational assistance act of 1974" -which i recently developed and introduced with senator kennedywas dramatically portrayed in a timely front page article in todays new york times by lawrence k. altman. the article entitled "many foreign physicians in u.s. found unlicensed" describes. and i quote: a growing medical underground of thousands of foreigntrained doctors in practicing medicine without licenses and often without supervision in many american hospitals. the altman story is based on a report published today in the new england journal of medicine. our bill. s. 3585. addresses the growing foreign medical graduatefmgproblem by one. providing for the number of training slots. and. two. by the establishment of minimal medical licensure requirements. including proficiency in the english languageboth verbal and written. the activities would be achieved by the secretary of the department of health. education. and welfare working in consultation with appropriate medical organizations. when i introduced this measure with senator kennedy. i documented the fmg problemin slightly more than a decade the number of fmgs in the united states has increased four times more rapidly than has the total physician supply. in 1972. almost as many fmgs46 percent of the totalas graduates of u.s. medical schools were added to the licensure registries for physicians in our separate stateswith particular emphasis with respect to the problem in new york. where about onefourth of all foreigntrained physicians10.000 of 45.816in the united states are in new york city. taking the state of new york as a whole. foreign medical graduates represented about 19 percent of all physicians in 1959. the proportion has risen steadily. until  about 36 percent of physicians in the state are graduates of foreign schools. i am deeply concerned that fmgs. taken as a whole. should sustain  dilute the quality care provided to the american people. i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record.
. i urge my colleagues to support the passage of the alcohol and drug abuse education act amendments of 1974 . alcoholism and drug abuse in our country has been- increasing. we are seeing . in this. contry. the development of a frightening pattern of polydrug use. young people. even at the junior and senior high school levels. are taking drugs in combinationamphetamines. barbiturates. tranquilizers. and others. frequently mixed with alcohol. while we need to develop some clinical treatment models for youngsters so deeply enmeshed in polydrug use as to be rendered functional. we should  fail to heed the major lessons to be learned from our experience in dealing with the drug abuse problems over the past few years. the drug abuse problem can be solved by our simply dealing with its ultimate manifestation in the individual. that is addiction or crippling polydrug use. the abuse of any substance is complex human behavior which is influenced by many forces. school. family. church. community. media. peer group pressure. we must undertake the development of educational program models that utilize the resburces of all of these in order to affect drug taking behavior before it reaches the final stage. one where already overburdened and often still uncertain health professionals must be called upon again for a solution. we must undertake early intervention and primary prevention activities. aimed at helping experimenters and users out of the "taking" category before taking becomes "abusing." and at helping the troubled youngsters who. even though a user. may be headed for trouble with drugs because of their abundance and easy accessibility. because of peer pressure to conform. to join. to belong. and because of the more general but equally strong overall pressure in our society to opt for the chemical solution to lifes problems. the community at large. and the schools particularly. are in the best position to focus on the causes of drug abuse rather than the symptoms. to reflect their own specialized needs. and to plan and develop responsive early intervention and prevention programing. criticisms of socalled drug education efforts have been leveled at programs which have focused for the most part on providing massive- amounts of information. very often to bored or hostile audiences. such criticism is well directed. but  because education does  work. rather because information is  education. drug education should be a total process of interaction between individuals which emphasizes the effective as well as the cognitive approach. a process in which drug information is utilized as a nutritive ingredient for the mutual growth of teacher and student alike. to the end of involving the student in intellectual. cultural. and social alternatives to drug abuse. the pending legislation for the first time will permit our nation to mount the appropriate national attack to. achieve these objectives. the committee reported bill is substantially identical to the bill i authored and introduced. with senator hughes. chairman of the subcommittee on alcoholism and narcoticswho has provided our nation with exceptional leadership with respect to this critical problem of drug abuseand cosponburnc by all of the miity members of the committee on labor and public welfaresenators
second. . i wish to call attention to the provisions in the conference report which would authorize special project grants and contracts for medical schools to develop and operate programs which provide increased emphasis on the ethical. social. moral. and legal implications of advances in biomedical research and techogy. unfortunately. leadership in the reform of practices in the use of human subjects at risk in research procedures has  come from the medical profession per se. in large measure. the response to assure meaningful control to tragic accounts of experiments involving human beings has come from governmental sources. our medical schools have a proud record of scientific leadership and i am confident that through medical school programs. stimulated by these provisions. their record in ethical. moral. and social ination can be equally distinguished. the ideals of the medical professionset forth in the hippocratic oath. and codes such as the declaration of helsinkirelate primarily to concern for the individuals good as entrusted to the physician. it is urgent that our medical schools place greater emphasis upon the totality of the physicians consideration for the individual and society of the ethical. moral. and social concerns inherent in scientific inquiry. while the profession highly values research. it must. at the same time. more deeply involve itself in the consideration and implication of the ethics and morality of the enlistment of human subject in such highly valued research. i believe scientific inquiry must constantly be blended with judgment. compassion. and sympathy. the true synthesis of humaneness and humanity. i feel very hoed to have been responsible for its inclusion in the conference substitute. the provision is identical to a bill i authored and introduced with senator williams. the chairman of the labor and public welfare committee. and cosponsored by senator mondale. these provisions will provide the opportunity for our nations medical schools to develop the appropriate program curriculums regarding ethical. moral. and social issues to meet that needthe protection of human subjects at risk in medical research and improved understanding of the consequences and implications for the individual and society of the advances in biomedical scienceand through their own initiative and leadership construct an appropriate continuing professional institutional activity to safeguard human subjects in research. as to individual rights. which were much debated in terms of conscience as to some of these matters which we have discussed. the senator from massachusetts and my colleague from new york . who has taken such a distinguished role in some of these matters. will be discussing them. i believe the conference report takes us to about where we can be in terms of the law and the constitution. they have in mind the possibility of certain other legislation. and i simply wish to affirm that i shall study it and regard it with the greatest openness of mind. and. indeed. sympathy. but for the purposes of this conference. i think that. as senator kennedy will explain. we have done all that we could do within the parameters of bringing about an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate as far as this provision in the bill is concerned. i am in accord with this effort and wish to affirm it.
. i call to the attention of my colleagues an abc news investigative documentary on health care for children. which would be on the air at 10 p.m.. e.d.t. on wednesday. i believe this program is worthy of our attention and i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the release describing the program be printed in the record.
i join with the senator. senator nelson. senator percy and others in this amendment. senator ervin has expressed. i think. our views with the greatest eloquence. during our debate in the senate in 1970 on the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act. i mged the senate to vote against the adoption of k provisions both for the federal system and for the district of columbia. since that time. the american people have reaped an unfortunate harvest of abuse. hardship and sometimes tragedy in connection with the implementation of these laws. during this period. numerous citizen complaints have been received by members of congress concerning the administration of the federal k law which is found in 21 u.s.c. 879. specifically this statute allows unannced forcible entries by federal officers in certain drug law enforcement situations. a special k search warrant must be issued by a judge or u.s. magistrate in all such cases. the provisions of the district of columbia k law. d.c. code sections 23521. 522. 561. 591. cover unannced forcible entries in cases of search warrants. arrest warrants. and arrest without a warrant based on probable cause. under this statute warrant sanctioning entry is necessary if the officers on the scene have probable cause to believe that any of the grounds justifying forcible entry exist at that time. we all by  must be familiar with the accounts of how certain law enforcement officersdespite the dedication and professionalism of the overwhelming majority of their colleagueshave broken into the wrong homes and have harassed and sometimes harmed inent victims. on june 25. 1973 the new york times ran an extensive article alleging that violent drug raids against the inent were found to be widespread throughout the nation. although that article was made part of the record at the time that it appeared. i ask unanimous consent that it be printed again in the context of our debate today because of the grave consequences to our constitutional government which these activities represent.
. i urge my colleagues to concur in the house amendment to the senatepassed alcohol and drug abuse education act amendments of 1974h.r. 9456. the bill we are considering today which concurs in the senate amendment with an amendment is substantially similar to the bill i authored and introduced with senator hughes. the chairman of the alcohol and narcotics subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfare. who has provided all americans with outstanding leadership and dedication to establishing a national commitment to a war against alcoholism and drug abuse. and cosponsored by senators williams. dominick. cranston..
. i believe the bill we are  considering. which concurs in the senate amendment with an amendment. is a most satisfactory resolution of the differences between the original house and senate passed drug abuse education bills. in great -measure the satisfactory accommodation of all viewpoints is due to the efforts of staff on behalf of the members of both the house and the senate. in particular. i would want to commend mary ellen miller. counsel to the alcohol and narcotics subcommittee. jay cutler. miity counsel to the committee on labor and public welfare. jack duncan. counsel to the house select subcommittee on education. and martin lavor. miity legislative associate of the health committee on education and labor.
. i have other money amendment and i realize that there were heavy cuts in health and education that concern money. i have more money amendments. senator kennedy will speak for himself. and the chairman and ranking member would k better than i. this particular item is just. as these senators themselves have favored. so favored in view of our emergency situation that i do  think the senator need fear.
. i wish to make a few remarks on other provisions of the bill which have relationship to those that we have so far discussed. one is a matter of the health appropriations. in which we feel that the committee has done. within the limitations which it has imposed and which we can all understand. the best that it probably can do. with respect to health appropriations funding requests i made in testimony before the appropriations committees i would e several areas.
it is also appropriate to give you the views of secretary brennan on this proposed exemption which he expressed to our committee during its oversight hearings on july 22. 1974. he said: an exemption of 25 or fewer employees would exempt about 90% of all workplaces and about 17 million workers. this provision would leave vast numbers of employees without federal job safety and health protection. this provision would create an unfair and intolerable situation where workers at some establishments are protected. while workers at other establishments. exposed to the same hazards. doing the same kind of work. are  protected simply because of a numbers game. the secretary also said: i do  believe the congress intended to leave any worker in our smaller establishments without job safety and health protection. the life of that man or woman is just as valuable as the life of an employee in a larger firm. . i ask unanimous consent that the letter to my colleagues from chairman williams and me be included in the record.
. i urge my colleagues support of the "health professions educational assistance act of 1974" as set forth in the amendment. the measure deals with the manpower problemsgeographic maldistribution. specialty maldistribution. foreign medical graduates. licensurewhich continue to plague the health of the american people. our medical. dental. and other health profession schools have responded heroically in increasing production of physicians. dentists. and other health professionals. but merely producing more health professionals will  solve the health manpower problems facing the nation. we have serious national geographic maldistribution of health professionals. withstanding new york state having the nations highest physicianpopulation ratio2.44 per 1.000there are 44 counties who have fewer physicians per population than the u.s. average of physicians per population1.33 per 1.000. the buffalo standard metropolitan statistical area has a physicianpopulation ratio lower than the national m for an area its size. furthermore. huge disparities prevail within new york city where there are four times as many physicians per population in higher income neighborhoods as compared to the poor neighborhoods in new york city. i ask unanimous consent that an hew computer readout for new york state with respect to trends in physician distribution 19601970 be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
we have insufficient primary care physicians and probably have more specialists than are requiredin 1949. only 36 percent of physicians limited their practice to a specialty. in 1970. 79 percent were specialists. in new york state. there is a 2.243 shortfall. the greatest in the nation. of family physicians and general practitioners. we increasingly continue to rely upon citizen foreign medical graduates to provide health care to the extent that we  have what has been termed a "medical underground" where there is an everincreasing group of foreign medical graduates of certified physicians with unsupervised direct patient care responsibilities. and unfortunately for new york city. about onefourth of all foreigntrained physicians practice there to the extent that about 36 percent of the physicians in new york state are graduates of foreign medical schools. in fact. 94 percent of psychiatric residents in the state hospital system are foreign medical graduates and 40 percent of the physicians in the mental hospital system are unlicensed. i believe it is essential that we either effectively overcome these health manpower problems or conclude that the taxpayers dollar can be more wisely expended for other purposes. to achieve the goals of overcoming the problems of geographic and specialty maldistribution. heavy reliance upon foreign medical graduates. and the existence of inconsistent and inequitable state licensure laws. the amendment would in essence provide. subject to my previous comments: a. prohibit the secretary of health. education. and welfare from making capitation grants to health professions schools after june 30. 1974. unless these schools require each student to enter into an agreement with the secretary to serve at least 2 years in areas or institutions with manpower shortages. b. require the secretary of health. education. and welfare to establishin cooperation with appropriate professional organizationsminimal national standards for state licensure of physicians and dentists. including appropriate procedures to periodically relicense such practitioners. and c. require the secretary of health. education. and welfare with the assistance of national and regional advisory councils and in cooperation with appropriate professional organizations to certify the number and appropriate balance of postgraduate physician training programs. the decision to take such thoughtfulyet boldlegislative action is thoroughly supported and documented by the hearing record and set forth in great detail at pages 51 through 110 of the report on the bill (931133). in order for our ultimate goal of national health insurance to become a reality we must guarantee that there is a sufficient number of welltrained physicians available to administer the best possible medical care to every american. yet at the same time there is incontrovertible and overwhelming evidence of a serious and growing problem of physician geographic maldistribution. i suggest to my colleagues that the proof of this geographic maldistribution can be readily determined by looking at their own state map of physician distribution. printed in the report at pages 468 through 519. it is clear that disproportionate distribution of physicians exists  only between urban and rural regions. states. and areas but maldistribution exists within metropolitan areasbetween inner cities and suburbsas well. moreover. there has been improvement even in states where specific programs have been directed toward the problem. with respect to the need for more primary care physicians it is clear that any serious effort to modify specialty distribution requires us to intervene in the graduate medical education system. to quote dr. kenneth endicott. administrator of hews health resources administratior primary care problem is quite substantial and it is  a matter that can be addressed by tinkering or making mi adjustments in the system. the hard facts about the increased proportions of physicians who practice specialty medicine are set forth at pages 55 through 72 of the report. i believe such direct federal intervention in this area was inevitable but at the same time that we need substantial professional consensus on a number of key value judgmentssuch as how many specialty or sub specialty of any type are needed per unit of populationand for this the amendment provides. it is essential that we take steps that lead to the reduction of our current excessive dependence on citizen foreign medical graduates. i can find reasonable. intellectual. or philosophical rationale for this nation to take from less fortunate underdeveloped nations their desparately needed medical manpower to meet our national needs for physicians. foreign medical graduates are  approaching 20 percent of all physicians practicing in this country. in addition onethird of all hospital internship and residency training posts are filled by foreign medical graduates. in 1972. 46 percent of all licenses issued were to foreign medical graduates. i think this reliance is unwise because: first. most of the foreign medical graduates who have entered this country in recent years are graduates of medical schools whose curricula are very different from ours and which are located in countries whose cultures and institutions are so different from ours that their graduates are ill prepared to practice in the united states. second. foreign medical graduates in the aggregate are less successful in obtaining unrestricted. permanent licenses to practice than are u.s. medical graduates. a significant proportion continually fail licensure exams while continuing to staff our health institutions to the detriment of quality patient health care. it should be ed that foreign medical graduates have a 600percent greater failure rate on state medical licensure examinations as compared to u.s. medical graduates. the pervasive nature of the problem of citizen foreign medical graduates. to which this amendment responds. is set forth in great detail at pages 93 through 111 of the report and the hearings have documented the existence of a medical underground of foreign medical graduates who are practicing medicine today and who have  completed their state licensing examinations. also. the testimony documents that these foreign medical graduates are  practicing in state institutions. county hospitals. general hospitals. and city hospitals. they frequently cover emergency rooms. perform general practice functions. deliver babies. et cetera. the need for federal standards for medical and dental licensure is documented by the considerable variance in state requirements for licensure. within states and from state to state. requirements vary from u.s. medical graduates. canadian medical school graduates. and for graduates of foreign medical schools. such policies reflect differing standards for premedical work. undergraduate medical training. internships and residencies. citizenship. and licensure examinations. although almost all states require candidates to pass either the national boardsthe examination developed by the national board of medical examinersor the flex examthe examination developed by the federation of state licensing boardsas a prerequisite for licensure. most u.s. graduates take the national boards and most foreign medical graduates take the flex examinations. each state has the prerogative of setting its own passing levels for the flex examination. fortythree state boards issue temporary educational permits. limited and temporary licenses. or other certificates for the practice of medicine. state board policies for issuing such permits differ considerably. in october 1970. the carnegie commission report entitled "higher education and the nations health" recommended that the feasibility of national licensing requirements for all health manpower be explored and recommended national requirdments for periodic reexamination and recertification of all physicians and dentists by specialty boards and other appropriate bodies. thereafter. in 1971. the department of health. education. and welfare study on health professions licensure flatly recommended that states adopt national examinations for the licensure of health professionals. i recognize that this is highly controversial and presents solutions to the serious health manpower problems which are  in accord with many of the medical and dental schoolsbeneficiaries of the taxpayers dollarviews yet billions of federal assistance have been made available while problem areas have grown worse. i do  believe as others argue. that the problems are well on the way to solution when the evidence overwhelmingly indicates the opposite to be the case. i am concerned that the taxpayerthe american publicis  receiving full value for the investment we are making on their behalf in medical. dental. and other health professions education. we must either act to overcome the problems which deny the public and benefits they rightly deserve or we must fundamentally call into question the appropriateness of continuing to require the american public through their tax dollars to contribute so heavily to medical. dental. and other health professions education. the amendment has chosen to do the former. believing that course represents the wiser one and the course truly to be in the public interest. i believe it important to point out that without an obligated service program underserved communities will have to continue to rely upon the rhetoric of those who suggest the problem is  really extreme or that existing mechanisms will meet the need if only given more time. those who propose a different approach have evidence to document its efficacy. and are unable to rebut the evidence contained in section v of the report and hearing record. it is important to clarify certain common misconceptions respecting the obligated service provisions of the bill. first of all the bill does  require any health professional school to receive federal capitation support. second. the service agreement is betwcen the student and the united states. and does  directly involve the school. third. any school may choose to admit students who refuse to agree to serve. though in that event the school would be denied its federal capitation support. fourth. in the event a licensed graduate fails to meet his service obligation. the institution from which he graduated is in way involved or penalized. . i ask unanimous consent that nik edes of the staff have the privilege of the floor during the debate on this measure.
i can only say to the senator that the extrapolation is my own. the result of a number of years of experience with the program. in fact. i am the ranking member of this committee actually dealing with the nittygritty. the first answer about an engineer is yes. it is intended precisely for people whom the ecoic system at the moment can absorb. secondly. it is strictly transitional. the real worth of the facts and figures i have cited. which each member must pass onbut i represent them to the senate as the best facts that we haveis that it is transitional and it really does work out. to wit. that :t gives a person an opportunity to get off the unemployment rolls for a time until he really can do something else. - lastly. what this engineer will do will depend upon the local prime sponsor he is dealing with. and their estimate of what ought to be his capabilities. e of the jobs are makework. that is aher thing that has come out. i would like to give a catalog of that. they have been in the following categories: public works and transportation. 22 percent. education. 20 percent. law enforcement. 12 percent. health and hospital service. 9 percent. parks and recreation. 8 percent. social services. 6 percent. environmental protection. 4 percent. fire protection. 2 percent. and general administration and other. the remaining 17 percent. so it has been highly diversified. in the first place. we had facts and figures relating to individual performance and operations. but i would like to again emphasize the extraordinary rate of permanent employment which has come out of the other end of the tube after the 2 years of public employment. as many as 82 percent within a year thereafter were in regular employment at higher compensation.
. since i joined with senators cranston and williams in the introduction of the national arthritis acts. 2854the measure has gained the sponsorship of 75 senatorsa tribute to the deep public concern about the need to establish a national commitment to launch an attack on arthritis. the nations  1 crippling disease. arthritis is a major health problem in the united statesestimated to affect more than 20 million americans. and 1 out of every 4 families. in addition to its toll in terms of the human pain and suffering and chronic disability caused by arthritis its ecoic dimensions are staggering. the annual cost to the nation due to medical care bills and lost wages caused by arthritis is $9.2 billion and it is rising steadily. i am concerned that the needs of victims of arthritis1 out of every 10 americans are afflicted with arthritis severe egh to require medical careare  being met at the present time and i believe these needs can be met in the future unless the federal government expands its leadership role in this area. we must provide the financial support that is essential to combating arthritis and unnecessary crippling. i believe the bill we are  consideringin great measure reflecting the dynamic leadership of the chairman of the health subcommittee. senator kennedy- will assure the federal government mounts an effective attack on arthritis. a unique facet of the bill is its approach to the problempresented to the committee during hearings on the measure in which i participatedwith respect to data indicating that $435 million is spent each year on arthritis quackery. this figure is merely the visible measure of the magnitude of this problem. unfortunately. the serious effects of the use of ineffective and potentially harmful remedies can exacerbate arthritis or cause increased and unnecessary disabilities as well as death. the bill as reported requires that screening. detection. prevention. and control programs shall include public information programs to discourage the promotion and utilization of unapproved and ineffective diagtic or treatment procedures. including ineffective drugs and devices. in addition. the nationa arthritis task force is directed to de. velop a program of periodic dissemination of information on the status oj arthritis treatment and control procedures with a view toward discouraging the exploitation of the arthritis victiz by unscrupulous promoters of false remedies. i believe it is essentdal in combating arthritis quackery for organized medicine to become an advocate in the legislative process to defuse the false hope. offered by ineffective and possibly dangerous remedies and  to leave the responsibility to protect the public solely to public officials who do  have the medical expertise to evaluate alleged "cures... in closing. i believe it is important to point out that new york was at the forefront of the funding of the national movement against arthritis. since nearly 26 years ago. when the arthritis foundation was founded. the foundations chapter in new york city has led the way in every aspect of arthritis research. patient care and information on the disease in the years that followed. the first vocational rehabilitation programs for arthritis sufferers were begun in new york. and these programs were adopted by other. organizations as model programs to assist victims of other diseases. new york also initiated homecare programs for arthritis sufferers which have served as national models. and is responsible for launching the nationwide movement to combat quackery in arthritisa $403 million health problem. today. the chapter and the foundations national headquartersalso located in new yorksupport a total of 11 arthritis clinical research centers in new york. all of which are deeply involved in major research and its application to improved patient care to people of all ages afflicted with the disease. yet the foundation alone can meet the total needs of arthritis sufferers in new york state. the arthritic victims steadily increase from year to yearthere are an estimated 1.6 million new yorkers afflicted with this crippling disease and hundreds of thousands of new yorkers who will be added to the arthritis "roster of human pain and sufferng"-yet unfortunately federal allocations to find an answer to this crippling disease are at a standstill. having leveled off from 1972 to date. senior cttizens700.000 have a moderate to severe form of arthritisare  alone. however. when it comes to the disease. wageearning women and men are particularly hit by rheumatoid arthritis. children. including the newborn. are victimized by the juvenile form of the disease. in new york state. children suffering with arthritis number an alarming 20.000. but arthritis is  solely new yorks problem. and i urge my colleagues to support the national arthritis act.
i just wish to reassure myself that by putting up $26 million themselves they are  fouled up by something that they had ice of whatsoever. the law extending the national cancer act provides public law 93352. at pertinent part thereof the authority. and i quote: to award grants for new construction as well as alterations and reations for improvement of basic research laboratory facilities. including those related to biohazard control. as deemed necessary for the national cancer program. the approved grant clearly meets such criteria and any failure to proceed with funding i believe violates the spirit and letter of the law. i would urge omb to reconsider its views.  for health science. cclumbia university in the city of new york. which thoughtfully articulates the concerns i have expressed. be printed in the record.
. as i said at the beginning of my remarks. this is a modest bill in terms of funding. but it is of major significance in assuring that we will have the numbers and kinds of nurses that are needed to bring essential health services to the people of this country. it represents a greatly increased emphasis on making nursing services more readily accessible and available. this trend has been started under the previous legislation and should be accelerated by the provisions of this bill. nursing has moved to try to meet expanding and changing needs for health services in all settings and areas of our country. we believe this bill helps to further that objective. i strongly urge passage of this legislation.
that is right. the hospitals and planning bill. the manpower bill is in conference. and as a mdtter of fact they are waiting for us right  to continue the conference. this involves the problems of the public hospitals. modernization and so on.
. to clarify one or two technical matters in the bill. i would like to address a question to the chairman. the senator from massachusetts . under section 1512 (b) (3) of the report. a health systems agency. which is a public regional planning body or unit of general local government. shall in addition to its governing body. have a separate governing body for health planning. it is my understanding that the governing body for health planning of such a public body or unit of local government would be appointed and subject to removal by the governing body of the health systems agency.
furthermore. am i correct in my understanding that in carrying out the responsibilities prescribed in subparagraph b(3) (b) of section 1512. the governing body for health planning would be subject to the rules and rulings of the health systems agency and that the health system plans developed pursuant to section 1513 and annual implementation plan would be submitted to the health systems agency for approval.
. anyone who has a big city in his stateand we all doand has had any personal opportunity to visit the municipal or public hospitals must be as depressed as i am about their condition. really. there is. on the whole. a very. very serious deficiency in the whole hospital system of the country. while we must be content with the provisions made by this bill. i would hope very much that the respective committees concerned in the exercise of their legislative oversight would look into the condition of the municipal hospitals and socalled public hospitals. and if it i. found that this provision contained ir the conference report is inadequateand i deeply feel it very likely to be inadequate. considering its restrictions---tha an effort will be made here to help with it on the federal level. i did wish to call to the attention o the senate the very serious condition which face those of us who represen states with big cities in this particui regard. and the very sharply limited ef fort to health which is contained in this bill. f i do  denigrate it or express any feeling that it should be rejected. because t of that. there is a lot in this bill that is very sound and very good. but it simply presents a serious problem to which we will need to address ourselves. and to which we do  address ourselves adequately in this bill.
. i urge my colleagues to concur in the house amendments to the senatepassed national arthritis act . the house amendments are. in essence. technical and conforming amendments which adopt all of the provisions of the senatepassed bill. since i joined with senators cranston and williams in introducing this legislation. it has been cosponsored by 75 senators evidencing the deep public concern about this crippling disease. during hearings. all witnesses. with the exception of those from the administration. joined in urging prompt passage. arthritis is a major health problem in the united states. an estimated 20 million americans suffer from arthritis severe egh that they seek a physicians help. arthritis affects all age groups. from the youngest to the most senior. for example. an estimated 75.000 americans under the age of 17 are afflicted. however. senior citizens are hit hardest. at least half of those over the age of 65 have evidence of arthritis. and 700.000 have a moderate to severe form of the disease. this bill reflects a deep concern that the federal government has  been providing adequate leadership in research. screening. detection and control programs and the development of necessary educational programs with respect to arthritis. i believe this legislation will assure that the federal government launches an effective allout attack on this painful and crippling disease. i am pleased that the house amendments accept the provision in the senate passed bill which i authored with respect to "quackerythe serious problem of unapproved and ineffective alleged arthritis cures. the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. learned during the course of hearings on this measure that $435 million is spent each year on such quackery and this amount would appear to be merely the "tip of the iceberg" according to the experts. i believe this is a financial waste. but even more important. ineffective and potentially harmful remedies can exacerbate arthritis or cause increased and unnecessary disabilities. and even death. the provision i authored provides for programs for the dissemination of information to the general public to discourage the promotion and use of unapproved and ineffective diagtic. preventive. treatment and control methods and unapproved and ineffective drugs and devices. in addition. the national commission on arthritis is directed to develop a longrange plan which shall include programs of this type. it is our hope that a vigorous program of public information will go far to alleviate the problem of quackery. also. i believe that organized medicine must become a leader in speaking out about the problem of quackery. the responsibility to protect the public must  be left to public officials who do  have the medical expertise to evaluate alleged "cures". i urge my colleagues to support the national arthritis act. as amended. and allow us to advance a national attack on arthritis. i thank my colleague.
. harold hughes during his 6 years as a u.s. senator and three terms as gover of iowa has displayed a unique blend of conscience and compassion. harold hughes is a man who has great courage buttressed by his deep convictions. he leaves the senate by his own choice. firm in his belief that he has a more important call on his dedication to life. although he is leaving the senate after one term. harold hughes has performed a lifetime of work in the fields of alcoholism and drug abuse. in 1969 he was named chairman of the special subcommittee on alcoholism and narcotics and proceeded to educate members of congress and the american people on these tragically iged problems. as a result of his work and leadership. landmark legislation was passed to aid the victims of these dreaded afflictions. under his guidance we in 1970 passed the comprehensive alcohol abuse act and in 1972 an omnibus drug abuse law. for those great efforts alone. millions of americans are indebted to him. i would like to convey my deep thanks and admiration to the senior senator from iowa and hope that his future endeavors be as successful as his senate career and to wish him and his family all happiness.
. i am joining today in introducing with senator kennedy the medical devices amendments of 1975. this bill is identical to the bill . passed by the senate last yearunfortunately the house was unable to complete its deliberationsand in great measure incorporates the provisions of the medical devices safety act . which i introduced almost 2 years ago. the measure has the support of the administration. industry representatives. and consumer groups. the bill is cosponsored by senators williams.
 i am joining today. as ranking miity member of the labor and public welfare committee. in introducingwith the chairman of the committee. senator williams. and the chairman. senator kennedy. and ranking miity member. senator schweiker. of its health subcommitteethe emergency unemployment health benefits act. our bill is an emergency stopgap measure- designed to protect the health of millions of unemployed american workersmen and womenwho. through fault of their own are being laid off due to the current ecoic crisis. i ot only will these americans be without a job. but at the same time they will be without any protection for the health care needs of themselves and their loved ones. unemployment benefits leave room to afford the cost of purchasing health insurance protection. this measure is  intended to be a substitute for americas need for comprehensive national health insurance.  is it intended to remedy any inequities or inadequacies in our existing health care system. rather. it is a humanitarian legislative response to a tragic ecoic emergency and one which assures millions of americans a form of health insurance protection if they are the unfortunate victims of illness. iniury. or disease. while the benefits of two measures i sponsored last december which were enacted into lawthe emergency jobs and unemployment assistance act and the emergency unemployment insurance actprovide some measure of security for the 7.5 million workers currently unemployed. they are  the entire answer. unemployment insurance benefits. on the average. replace between 50 and 60- percent of the unemployed workers lost wages. while this may serve to help keep a roof over his head and help to feed and clothe his family. it does  take into account the critical need for health insurance protection which the unemployed worker finds he can maintain when he can obtain gainful employment. the lack of financial resources to purchase health insurance protection leaves the unemployed american workers and their families only one unacceptable alternativedelay or denial of necessary medical care. thus. the health condition worsens. as when an upper respiratory infection becomes life -threatening pneumonia.  the treatment is substantially more expensive and this bankrupting financial burden is cast upon the already financially overburdened state treasury. as the unemployed ill person enters for the first time the medicaid system. to maet this problem our bill would establish an emergency program to continue the health benefits coverage of those persons who are unemployed and eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. it would continue basic health benefits coverage of nearly 8 million unemployed workers. and their families. despite their unemployment. as though they were still employed. thus. approximately 25 million americans will be benefitted during the life of this program. such coverage is to be provided in the same manner and to the same extent as when the unemployed person was gainfully employed. the bill provides: first. in order to be eligible a person: must be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits under any federal or state unemployment program including the special unemployment assistance program. must have been eligible for health benefits coverage. and must  be eligible for health insurance as a result of prior employment or coverage through a spouse or other family member. second. a personand any of his dependents who were covered under the health benefits programwould be eligible for coverage as when employed. regardless of the source of payment. for hospital. medical. and surgical benefits. third. coverage would be provided through the health benefits program under which the person was covered during his last employment. fourth. an employer or health and welfare trust would be required to certify that the person was covered. the extent of the coverage. the cost of the coverage. the date of termination of coverage. and the name and address of the health benefits program. fifth. the employer or health and welfare trust would be advised by unemployment insurance offices of the initial eligibility and termination of eligibility of the employee. sixth. payment of premiums for unemployed workers would be made to the employer. the health and welfare trust or to a carrier designated by the payee. seventh. the emergency program would be for 1 year and there would be authorized such sums as may be necessary. the preliminary estimates of the cost of the bill-$1.5 billionassume an annual average premium cost of about $500 for the approximately 3 million eligible unemployed workersat any one timewith an assumed average 8 percent unemployment rate for the life of the bill. this is a substantial federal expenditure. but i prefer to consider it a humanitarian investment in the health care of americas unfortunate victims of the present ecoic crisis. there are imperfections and inequities in this emergency bill. and a variety of other alternatives for offering health care to the unemployed have been considered. however. i believe this bill is the best emergency program that can be passed promptly by the congress. i intend to continue to work for the enactment of a comprehensive national health insurance scheme which would avoid such future emergencies.
. in authorizing and reorganizing health manpower legislation the senate acts as the steward of the american people regarding the purposes and the amount of funding for health professional schools. in that respect the senate must be constantly vigilant in asking itselfis the public receiving full value for the investment the nation is making. i believe that the public at large is  at this time receiving full value. having reached that conclusion. based upon the evidence to date. i believe we must act to overcome the problems which deny the public the benefits they rightly deserve. or call into question the appropriateness of continuing to require the american public through their tax dollars to contribute so heavily to the health professions institutions. in essence. i believe it is essential that tb senate pass a bill designed to achieve the following health manpower objectires. which have yet to be attained: first. assure financial stability for the educational institutions upon which the nntion must depend for its supply of highquality health professional manpower. second. assure adequate forms of student assistance. for too long the health professional educational institutions of this nation have  reached out and recruited capable young people regardless of their financial situation. third. assure that we overcome effectively the problem of geographic maldistribution of health professionals. a problem that is national in scope and a problem that is longstanding and pervasive and which is a problem that is rapidly growing worse.  better. fourth. assure that we overcome specialty maldistribution of physicians. all too frequently residency training programs which are the determinants of the number and kinds of physicians the nation produces are designed to meet the service needs of community hospitals or the research needs of medical school faculties. rather than the health needs of the american people. the time has come to reorder such priorities. fifth. assure that we overcome our nations reliance on foreign medical graduates for the routine delivery of medical services. the record amply documents the growing reliance of this nation on fmgs. the qualifications and skills of many of whom must be seriously questioned. there is already existing in this nation a dual system of medical care in which some of the most unfortunate citizens of society. such as residents of state- and countyoperated mental institutions. must rely for medical services on doctors who may  be able to converse with them in the english language and whose professional skills were acquired under very different conditions. testimony documents that onethird of all physicians in residency training programs in this nation today are foreign medical graduates and about 50 percent of the new licenses granted to physicians are granted to foreign medical graduates. i believe any national insurance scheme must be based on the necessary support for a massive expansion of medical. dental. nursing. and other health manpower and this should be the goal of any bill favorably acted upon by the senate. by mr. iye:
. today i join with senator kennedy in introducing a joint resolution to provide for the annual proclamation of national medical laboratory week for the period of april 1319. this week of recognition is endorsed by six national. professional laboratory organizations: american society for medical techogyasmt. american medical techogistsamt. international society of clinical laboratory techogistsisclt. american society of clinical pathologistsascp. american society for microbiologyasm. and american association of blood banksaabb. medical laboratory science has expanded tremendously over the years. there are more than 150.000 practitioners. performing some 5 billion tests annually as an integral part of a health care team seeking to provide reliable diagtic data to insure quality patient care. the advent of automation and sophisticated instrumentation in the laboratory has strengthened the need for intensive academic and clinical training to carry out the responsibilities which involve the very preservation of human life. the active involvement of highly skilled. educated professionals dedicated to establishing the highest standards of medical laboratory methods and research to increase the reliability of diagtic procedures that may improve the chances of a more healthful life for every american is essential. the services rendered by our nations medical laboratories directly contribute to the individual and public health. as all americans increasingly turn their attention to issues of quality in our health care services. it is appropriate that we in congress recognize the daily service of these thousands of men and women in the medical laboratory who seek to advance that ideal. i ask. therefore. that we proclaim april 1319 as national medical laboratory week.
. public attention was recently focused on an article in the washington post by daniel greenberg which sought to cast serious doubts about the effectiveness of the crash national cancer program. which had been initiated under legislation i authored and introduced with senator kennedy. i believe my colleagues and the american public are entitled to have the benefit of a thoughtful analysis of the points made in mr. greenbergs article. accordingly. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of an article entitled "the national cancer program:  the good news." by frank j. rauscher. jr.. director of the national cancer institute. be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. scientific progress is mainly a matter of incremental movement. and i believe that there have been sufficient advances made to warrant the congressional conclusion for a continuation of the national attack on cancer. as evidenced in public law 93352. although mr. greenberg. the author of the washington post article. is a sophisticated and constructive critic. it is essential that we have the opportunity to read dr. rauschers thoughtful response to the greenberg article. a critical element in dr. rauschers response. with respect to the national cancer program. which i would commend particularly to my colleagues attention is. as dr. rauscher states: the fact is that increased funding for the ncp did  become available until 1972 and in 1973 the new nci cancer control program began its first year of operations designed to speed the application of the latest research results for the benefit of people. the full impact of this congressionally mandated control program will  be felt for several years because it takes time to get the latest diagtic and treatment methods into community practice where they may be applied for the benefit of all patients. ex srr i
. i am joining in the introduction with senator schweiker. on the request of the administration. a bill to consolidate various separate project grant authorities: alcoholism. drug abuse. health services for domestic agricultural migrants. family planning services. information and research. and support for other selected health services programs. the bill also would extend the formula grant programs under the comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention. treatment. and rehabilitation act of 1970. and the drug abuse office and treatment act of 1972. i am pleased that the administration has chosen to recognize the importance of continuing these programs. however. i can support the reduction in the formula grant authorization levels.  the shifting of funding support through consolidation under section 314(e) of the public health service act for alcoholism and drug abuseas contrasted to the congressional mandate for the continuation of carefully articulated and necessarily separate categorical programs. my deep concerns about the administrations view with respect to the consolidation under section 314(e) of the public health service act of various categorical programs was set forth in the last congress. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of those comments be printed in the record.
. i recently joined in introducing with senators kennedy. williams. and schweiker. the "nurse training and health revenue sharing and health services act of 1975" . the labor and public welfare committee has favorably reported this bill which responds in a contrary methodology to the administrations consolidation approach. i believe that the committee reported bill provides the appropriate answer. congress should determine the categories of health programs for which project grant funds are advisable and should be made.
. one of the most critical health care issues confronting our nation is the documented shortage of physician primary care services for the american people. in 1949. 50 percent of all physicians considered themselves to be general practitioners. however. by 1970 that percentage had dropped to 22 percent. at the same time physician specialists increased from 37 percent in 1949 to 80 percent in 1970. utilizing the definition of primary care set forth by dr. robert g. petersdorf at the primary care conference organized by the association of american medical collegesthe physician of first contact for the patient. who solves as many of the patients health problems as possible. and who coordinates the remainder of the patients health care through an ongoing and continuing relationship with the patietto determine the extent to which the medical schools are in fact carrying out programs to achieve that goal. i have had dr. david banta. a robert wood johnson health policy fellow with the institute of medicine. who is serving as a fellow on behalf of the miity professional staff of the committee. survey medical schools regarding the programs they are conducting with respect to primary care. the initial survey conducted by dr. banta was of the twelve new york medical colleges. i ask unanimous consent that his findings be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. upon reviewing dr. bantas survey. which indicates that only 1 of the 12 medical schools have a required clinical experience of any duration in primary care and only 3 others have remote site training. i have asked dr. banta to expand the scope of the survey to all medical schools and report on his findings. i believe this information will be of great value to the committee on labor and public welfare. as it considers various legislative proposals which seek to insure that federal funding for medical education will provide the requisite incentives to medical schools to contribute to the solution of the problems of shortages of primary care physicians. while the percentage of residents training in primary care is almost 40 percent. if residents in internal medicine. pediatrics. and obstetrics/gynecology are included. only 4 percent of the total are in family medicine residences. thus. while all would appear to qualify under the definition utilized. we must continue to be concerned about the issue of whether other than family medicine "specialists" will provide care in medically underserved areasfor we k there is a tendency for the internal medicine. pediatrics. and obstetrics/gynecology specialists to practice in urban areas.
may i say to my colleague that whether he is right or wrong on the medical conclusion. and whatever happens to this amendment. the fact that he is the author of this amendment and is making this statement is very important as to its legislative history and what happens in the days ahead. i think it is all very constructive
. the ballett amendment. without regard to medical need. would completely deny health benefits to women who are poor and most distinctly in need of adequate medical care to improve their health. this amendment. by denying abortions only to women who are poor. is discriminatory for it deprives women too poor to pay of the rights which the constitution and the supreme court accord to women with means. the amendment would effectively deny millions of lowincome women their right to good health care by prohibiting the use of the only funds available to them for this medical service. also. this amendmen. eliminates all decisionmaking and exercise of choice on the part of women who are poor. thereby infringing upon their civil rights and personal freedom. the thrust of this amendment would be to deny indigent women the equal protection of the laws to which they are constitutionall3 entitled. they alone are subjected to state coercion to bear children which they do  wish to bear and other woman is so coerced. the amendment would deny the indigent woman medical assistance unless she resigned her freedom of choice and bears the child. thus she is discriminated against by reason of her poverty and by reason of her behavioral choice. i beileve abortion. consistent with responsible medical practice. is a matter of private choice and personal conscience. and we must fight against an amendment which would constitute a legal impediment to equal protection for a class of women who must look to the federal and state governments for financing of their health care. certainly. the impact of the amendment would be contrary to the intent of the medicaid legislation which is "to help such families and individuals (as are eligible) to attain or retain capability for independence or self care." the cost of bearing and raising a child is considerable and the burden created by an unwanted child can be devastating for a lowincome family. in many instances. the effect would be to deprive a woman of her independence and ability to care for herself and any children she might already have. besides forcing poor or near poor women to bear children they do  want. the congress would be forcing these women into a position of greater poverty and subsequent dependence on public assistance. . the department of health. education. and welfare estimates that the $40 to $50 million spent yearly by medicaid for abortion reimbursements is offset by a direct saving to the government of between $450 and $560 million in the next year alone. this was calculated by estimating the number of medicaid recipients who would carry their pregnancies to term and then require additional medical care and welfare payments for their unwanted children. less an authority that the u.s. commission on civil rights has recently concluded that the denial of reimbursement for abortion under medicaid is discriminatory and unconstitutional. i ask unanimous consent that its letter to me be printed in the record at this point.
the senator is absolutely right. and the answer. as i previously alluded to. is that this comes under the social security act. and that those who are recipients of medicaid and the recipients of maternal care. and so forth. under the social security act are the very people who are very likely to continue that syndrome of dependence upon the federal government. and instead of having a woman who is subjected to this procedure. you will have her as an afdc mother. which is costing billions and billions of dollars to this country. so if you are going to tote it up on the basis of the provident use of the taxpayers money. it is decidedly a losing proposition to pass this kind of an amendment.
 i believe the federa government has a right to finance whal it desires and determines is the righl thing for the federal government to finance. one of the things it has financec is medical care for the poor under medicaid. and that relates to the medical definition which senator kennedy has already given that anything which comel legitimately within the province of medical care is a proper subject for those pool people to get the benefit of by the way of medicaid funds. and the social security act itself defines this particular abortion procedure in medical terms. that is. where it is medically necessary or where it is medically appropriate. . senator buckley argues that the supreme court has said that the mere will of the woman in question is what is medically necessary or medically appropriate. but that is  the way i read roe against wade. and i would like to just read. if the senator will allow meit is very brief. and i will  intrude on his timethis paragraph from that case: although the results have been divided. most of the courts have agreed the right of privacy. however based. is broad egh to cover the abortion decision. but the right etheless is  absolute and is subject to some limitation. and that at some point the state interest in the protection of health. medical standards. and prenatal life becomes dominant. we agree with this approach. i will ask unanimous consent that that excerpt be included in the record.
. i introduce the "national venereal disease prevention and control amendments of 1975" to continue the national commitment established in existing law. which is based on a bill i introduced a little more than 3 years ago and which was in substance enacted into law. the bill i introduce today is cosponsored by senators kennedy. williams. schweiker. and senators abourezk.
ial messages have  called for this authority. electronic miniaturization. plastics. new methods of sterilization. and other advances in techogy have worked a revolution in biomedical engineering. they have given us artificial heart pacemakers. kidney dialysis units. defibrillators. modern anesthetic equipment. cardiac. renal. and other catheters. surgical implants. artificial veins. arteries. and heart valves. intensivecare monitoring units. and a myriad of diagtic and therapeutic instruments. these devices have saved many lives and contributed to better health care. yet. they may also pose serious safety hazards. moreover. future problems may be expected as new medical techogy and instrumentation enter the field. the increasing sophistication of medical devices combined with the inadequacies of current law have outpaced the hew ability to protect the public from faulty medical devices. a key reason for this is that without the passage of this bill there is duty upon medical device manufacturers to establish the safety or efficacy of their products prior to marketing under existing law.  does hew have the authority to prescribe standards of safety to which these devices must conform. instead. when hew would learn that a manufacturer may be injuring or defrauding the public through the sale of an unsafe or useless article. it must undertake a timeconsuming and expensive effort to prove to a court that the device is unsafe or that the manufacturers claims for it are false. moreover. even though a case may be decided in the favor of hew. the protection of the consumer is by means assured. for example. the testimony before the committee related how hew expended some half million dollars over a 5year period to take off the market a device kn as the relaxacizor. 400.000 of. which were in distribution throughout the country. nevertheless. even though the case was adjudicated in hews favor. a young texas man in possession of one of these devices. and apparently unaware of its dangers. was electrocuted by it. how many of these devices still remain in the hands of unsuspecting users is unkn. such a case requires the department to expend an idinate amount of the resources allocated to device regulation. and thereby restrict investigative effort with respect to other dangerous or useless devices. part of the problem stems from the lack of authority to require premarket scientific review of a medical device. however hazardous it may be. or to establish safety standards for those devices for which premarket review is unnecessary. however. it also suffers from a number of other regulatory deficiencies. this bill provides that explicit statutory authority. the time for the enactment of medical device safety legislation has arrived. i urge my colleagues to rass this essential consumer protection legislation.
. i commend the action of the senator from alabama . for his swift action and leadership regarding the summer food program. todays action. in accepting the house version of the summer food program extension. is one in which i concur. the beneficiaries of this necessary legislation will be the millions of needy children around the country. in this time of severe ecoic hardship. it is especially important that children from lower income families have available to them a nutritious ntime meal during the hot summer months. by accepting the house version the senate. in this particular instance. is agreeing temporarily to forego use of section 32 funds for this child nutrition program. this is being done solely in the interest of expediting passage and enactment of this measure. which is necessary in order to have the program continued this summer. the entire question of the use of section 32 funds. for child nutrition programs and other purposes. needs to be explored in depth. over the past several years. section 32 funds have become a valuable source of funding for child nutrition programs. and their future utilization may well be necessary to assure the continued success of these important programs. todays action in way indicates an intent or a willingness on my part to retreat from the use of section 32 funds for child nutrition programs. the use of section 32 funds in child nutrition programs has been tremendously valuable in the past. and i expect that it will continue to be in the future. but todays action. and the summer food program exension bill itself. is in the nature of an emergency action. primarily because the more comprehensive child nutrition bill will  be enacted in time to assure continuation this summer. it is because of that urgency. as well as my understanding that direct appropriations for this program will be taken up by the appropriations committee very shortly on the second supplemental appropriation bill. that i concur with the present action of the senator from alabama.
. today i join with senator hathaway in a bill which provides urgently needed continuity for the federal effort to combat drug abuse. the measure continues the existence of the white house special action office for drug abuse preventionredesignated as the office of drug abuse prevention policy in recognition of its redefined limited role of strict coordination and policy direction. the transfer in existing law of the program functionsdrug abuse and formula project grantsto the national institute on drug abuse is confirmed. and appropriations are authorized for such continued operation at their current levels of authorization. the measure is essential if wasteful interruption of federal effort is to be avoided. under existing law. on june 30 of this year the policymaking and coordinative functions of the special action office for drug abuse prevention would be completely abolished along with the office itself. with provision for their assumption by any other agency of government. moreover. authority for appropriations to the national institute on drug abuse lapses on the same date. the growth and extent of drug abuse over the past 3 years of experience had shown some decline until recently. it is clear that the drug abuse problemwhich so tragically afflicts americas young peoplemust be dealt with on a continuing basis. the evidence presented during recent 2 days of hearings by the alcoholism and narcotics subcommittee of the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. documented and strongly supported the need for an ongoing white house drug policymaking body to continue to coordinate drug traffic law enforcement and health/education drug prevention activities. at the same time the hearing record evidenced the tragic failure to implement the formula grants to assist states to deal with drug abuse as required by law. the formula grant program provides for allotments among the states of the funds appropriated on the basis of relative population. financial need. and need for programs of education. training. treatment. and rehabilitation re drug abuse. it is important to understand that in the senate report 92509. it was specifically stated that: the committee considers that each of these factors should be weighted equally and that the last factorthe need for the various programsis different from the firstpopulation. in disregard of this clear legislative history of congressional intent with respect to the equal weighting to the three criteria in the formulapopulation. capita income. and needthe need factor has  been considered at all in determining the state allocations. thus. although new york state has the distinct misfortune of the greatest need for combating drug abuse. that critical factor in determining a states allotment under the formula has been disregarded. in recognition that drug abuse is a national problem which does  recognize regional boundaries. i do  intend to propose a change in the criteria for the formula. targeted solely on neednew york having the greatest need. however. i do intend to press for white house assurance that the three factors in the formula are implemented as required by the law. indeed. recourse through the courts for failure to enforce the law may become necessary.
s cancer panel. i commend to the attention of my colleagues his remarks at the recent comprehensive cancer centers conference conducted at duke university medical center and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. as an author of the national cancer act i share the concerns expressed by the scientific community. however. it is important to recognize that the office of management and budget--ombhas frustrated explicit congressional intentthat increased funding for cancer research was to serve as an appropriations flagship and stimulate acrosstheboard increased funding for all biomedical research. at the same time it is importantas mr. schmidt points outthat the public and the scientific community realize the amount of major biomedical research that is being funded under the cancer program. over $300 million last year. i share the concern expressed by mr. schmidt that the other institutes which have traditionally supported basic biomedical researchgeneral medical sciences. allergy and infectious diseases. arthritis and metabolic diseases. and neurological diseaseshave  had their budgets increased at anything approaching the rate of increase for the cancer budget. however. the scientific community should come to realize the extent of the support by the cancer institute of basic. fundamental research. although  solely related to the war on cancer. i would also focus my colleagues attention on mr. schmidts additional comments respecting research training. with which i am in complete agreement. to wit: the most serious mistake we have made in the support of our biomedical research during the short period that i have been actively associated with this enterprise was the discontinuance by omb of the biomedical fellowship and training programs. it is absolutely essential to our success in the cancer program and in biomedical research generally that we bring a portion of our brightest young people into these programs. and fellowships and training grants have proved to be the most effective and most ecoical ways of doing that. these are among the best dollars we spend in terms of value received. certainly mr. schmidts thoughtful rebuttal to the arguments made against the training grant and fellowship program. in which he concludes such arguments do  stand up under examination. merits our earnest consideration.
. i introduce today. with senator williams. the national genetic diseases act and the national taysachs disease screening and counseling act. the two bills. when taken together with the sickle cell and cooleys anemia bills introduced by senator kennedy. will enable the congress to act effectively with respect to the genetic disease field. we can either continue the diseaseofthemonth syndromea separate bill for each disease--or recognize the commonality of our mutual goalsgenetic disease is a major unsolved health problem. 15 million americans suffer from a genetic disorderand act effectively. that is what i seek to achieve (and i feel senator williams. too) by introducing two separate bills. the taysachs bill provides the opportunity to pass piecemeal legislation and proliferate as the need arises. the genetics bill establishes the need for overall support for the problem.
. i believe we should seek to establish one total program directed toward genetic diseases in preference to having individual diseases singled out. should we next press for a separate bill for dysautoia. this is a devastating disease of the nervous system. with symptoms reading like a pandoras box of cruel punishments. and i k we would all be sympathetic to the problem. while a number of genetic diseases are restricted primarily to members of certain ethnic groupswhich can simplify the determination of the target population for screening procedureswe must  assume that screening and counseling are that simple. we have much to learn about the reaction of people being told they are carriers of a disease traitheterozygotesand then learning about their ensuing reproductive choices. increased participation by various social and behavioral scientists is essential to such programs. even more critical is the concern that when a person is seen in such a single disease program that we neglect their other health problems which might have a genetic component. what logic is there for having the person of jewish origin considered solely for taysachs disease. or a black person solely for sickle cell anemia. studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with coronary heart disease have a genetic abmality of lipoprotein metabolism. should they  be counseled with respect to such problerh. or if coronary patients have hypertension and diabetes as risk factors. which are strongly genetically determined. should they  be counseled with respect to such health problems. the time has come to have a total national program directed toward all genetic diseases in preference to having an individual disease singled out for special attention. we should longer proceed on a diseasebydisease basis. we should attack the larger scientific problem of thousands of diseases with a genetic component. to launch a national commitment to find solutions to genetic diseases the bill provides: first. the establishment of an identifiable administrative unit within the department of health. education. and welfare to focus and coordinate genetic research and the other fragmented activities respecting genetic diseases. i am confident the hearing testimony will determine where in hew. within the national institutes of health. this should occur. second. $75 million over 3 years for (a) grants and contracts to establish and operate voluntary genetic testing and counseling programs and (b) develop public information programs relating to diagis. treatment. and counseling of genetic diseases. third. $300 million over 3 years for grants and contracts for research and research training to understand the diagis. treatment. and control of genetic diseases. special programs to train genetic counselors and other health professionals. develop programs to educate practicing physicians. health professionals. and the public about the nature of genetic processes. the inheritance patterns. and the means. methods. and facilities available to diage. control. counsel. and treat genetic diseases. and develop counseling and testing programs for the diagis. control and treatment of genetic diseases. fourth. the establishment of a national advisory commission to study ethical. legal and social aspects of genetic diseases in relation to scientific and techogical advances in genetics and their implications for individuals and society. the bill has the support of the national genetics foundation. and other interested groups. and i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and the full text of communications from interested groups be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i authored the clinical laboratories improvement act of 1967. with then senator murphy of california. today i am introducing with senator kennedy the clinical laboratories improvement act of 1975 . our bill would extend the acts coverage to approximately 11.700 independent and hospital laboratories which  operate free of federal regulation. because too few states have enacted meaningful laboratory legislation. in addition many thousands of physicians perform laboratory- services in their offices for their patients. as a result of this vacuum. all these laboratories perform testing services without having to fulfill quality assurance prerequisites. which causes the disturbing findings i have inserted in the record. in 1967. senator murphy and i reintroduced the clinical laboratories improvement act which was enacted into law. public law 90174. i stated in my individual views of senate report 974: today adequate medical care is impossible without adequate and efficient laboratories providing information for the diagis and treatment of disease and the assessment of the patients medical condition. repeated investigations and studies show that an important proportion of clinical laboratories are substandard and have uncovered instance after instance of incorrect diagis which have resulted in unnecessary hospitalization. unneeded operations. inappropriate treatment. injury. or even death. this statement remains as true today as it was in 1967. studies indicate that unsatisfactory performance is demonstrated by 10 to 40 percent of laboratories in bacteriological testing. by 30 to 50 percent in various simple clinical chemistry tests. by 12 to 18 percent in blood grouping and typing. by 20 to 30 percent in hemoglobin measurements. and by 20 to 30 percent in measurement of serum electrolytes. this information indicates that erroneous results are obtained in more than 25 percent of all tests analyzed by these studies. these results have been derived from performance evaluation programs where the laboratories k they are being tested. and thus may represent the best which the laboratories can do. according to the center for disease control. furthermore. one study indicated that in microbiology. 7.6 percent of the interstate laboratory determinations were incorrect. while 16.5 percent of the determinations by other large laboratories were incorrect. yet only the interstate laboratories are  regulated by the clinical laboratories improvement act--clia. an article in the january 1973 changing times magazine has pointed out what this could mean in human terms. one study showed that a screening procedure for a type of female cancer either overlooked suspicious cells or wrongly reported malignancy about 30 percent of the time. in aher instance. a private laboratory failed to recognize in a pregnant woman an rh blood factor that could react with the blood of the unborn child and result in delayed therapy which would cause neurological impairment or death. i ask unanimous consent that the changing times article be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i have joined in -the introduction with senator schweiker. on the request of the administration. of s. 1756. a bill to extend appropriation authorizations for -communicable disease and other control programs. i am pleased that the administration .recognized through this legislation -the need for -a continued federal effort respecting these programs. however. i can support certain provisions in the bill. for example. i am opposed to the administrations recommendation for a reduction in the authorization levels. efforts to prevent and combat communicable disease reflects the strengths of a healthcare system. moreover. it is the weak. the disenfranchised. and the powerless that are most susceptible to these diseases. we :can permit our -immunization levels -to -drop -so all of -us are at risk and all of us are vulnerable. .we  .have the means to control polo. tetanus. diphtheria. measles. rubella. and - mumps. these are.communicable.diseases which recognize state boundary and :are issues of national concern. we must .continue to protect the less fortunate citizens of our country and avoid any further .epidemic :outbreaks of -these highly contagious diseases. .also. j.:am opposed to -the provisions in the bill which consolidate -venereal .disease with the -other disease and -control programs and also repeal the venereal -disease research and state formula -grant .authorities. there is -an urgent need .to continue the national commitment established in existing law based -on a bill i introduced a little more than 3 years .ago. we -have teached a new -chapter in the saga of vd prevention and control .and we must continue our.supportlevels both for proven and theorized control .activities. during 1974. the most -recent year for -which data is available. and the .second year of authority under -this act. several new and -interesting pheena -eccured -relative to control activities and incidence trends that have been perceived as positive by vd control personnel. at the same time it is essential that -we maintain the highest level of research support into the prevention of venereal disease. only recently new breakthroughs have been found and we dare   cut back .on our level of support. further. i am -opposed to the repeal. -in the administration -bill. -of leadibased poisoning grants at the local level. i am concerned by -the administrations failure to stimulate a commitment to the establishment of a national strategy with regard to education for health _promotion and preventive medicine. our killers -today -are accidents. heart disease. respiratory diseases. and lung cancer. if vwe are to control -these -epidemics. we .must.setforth a new strategy. one which :assists us to understand the nature and .causes of selfimposed risks. .adds to our -kledge -of illness. educate patients and consumers about health -maintenance and prevention. and improves the physical and social environment. that -is the purpose of health education legislation which senator kennedy and i introduced as separate bills. i believe we must explore new directional emphasis with regard to health .education. we can sit back and rely upon the past.
. i have joined in the introduction with senator schweiker. on the request of the administration. of s. 1753. a bill to extend the national health service corps. i am pleased that the administration has chosen to recognize the importance of a continuing federal effort respecting this vital program. however. i believe that a substantially greater commitment than the $18 million authorized in the administration bill is necessary. such limited authorizations will  allow us to make impact upon the critical problem of geographic maldistribution of physicians throughout this nation. the interfact of the national health service corps with institutional support and student assistance within the framework of health professions education bills is critical to any legislative deliberations on health manpower legislation. thus. i am confident the administrations bill will have the earnest consideration of the labor and public welfare committee as it deals with such broader health manpower issues. i believe it is appropriate at this point to express my deep concern with the regulations respecting assignment of national health service corps personnel. the administrations regulations have effectively precluded national health service corps personnel providing health care to our inner cities. although deeply sympathetic to our rural needs. i believe it is essential that national health service corps personnel be made available to all americans in need of health care including our inner cities. i intend to work for an amendment which achieves that goal. also deal with any question on the existing regulations.
. last friday evening. may 9. the distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee (senator kennedy) of the senate committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am the ranking member. delivered an excellent address at the harvard school of public health. his speech addresses the related issues of biomedical research and health manpower. and the problem of developing a national strategy in regard to health education and prevention. i share senator kennedys pride in the accomplishments of the nations biomedical research effort and support his urging for greater public accountability in biomedical research. one does  have to agree with all senator kennedy has said. to consider that he has provided excellent insights into the health manpower problems of this nationgeographic and specialty maldistribution of physicians and the problem of foreign medical raduatesfmgs. he challenges the health professions schools to come to grips with the problems to insure overcoming physicians geographic maladministration. i agree. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the remarks by senator kennedy at the harvard school of public health be printed in the record.
. on january 28. 1975. i placed in the record various tributes to the late richard tucker. one of our greatest operatic tes. i ask unanimous consent that a further tribute to  charles h. silver at the last board meeting of the board of trustees of the beth israel medical center in new york city be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record at this point. a copy of an article written by edward b. fiske in the new york times of june 8. entitled "head start: after 10 years. planning experiments." and a copy of an article in the new york times of june 8 entitled "ten years of health care called a success." by jane e. brody.
consider also the matter of coverage. the commission recommended that by july 1. 1975. farm workers be covered on the same basis as all other employees. only 15 states met that standard as of april 1. 1975. according to the interdepartmental workers compensation task force. considering the fact that agriculture today is one of the most hazardous occupations in the country. the failure of 35 states to provide this coverage is hing less than outrageous. aher set of critical recommendations of the commission concerns overall limits on benefits for total disability and for medical benefits. despite virtual unanimity of opinion in: this country in prior years on these recommendations. 14 states still provide limitations on permanent total disability benefits and six states still provide limitations on medical benefits. i ask unanimous consent that the tables prepared by the interdepartmental task force showing these limitations be printed in the record at this point.
. a great new yorker. dr. moses swick. has been serving the people of new york as a physician for over 50 years. he has just. on january 28. received his hoary doctor of medicine degree from the free university of berlin for his work on development of urography. even today. at age 75. he is caring for the sick at mount sinai hospital. dr. swicks pioneering research in the medical sciences. particularly in urology and nephrology. have been mentioned as being of potential el prize caliber. in addition. he continues to be a fine teacher for our young physicians. i commend dr. swick for his work and i ask unanimous consent that the article "dr. swick gets his german kudos45 years after." from the mount sinai hospital news. be printed in the record.
indeed. my state is one of the great dairy states of the country. so we are deeply interested in this. also. it recognizes the principle that we are under a formula which was adopted on a national level. and we have so many of them in housing. health and education. and in so many other fields. and it simply does  work. and it is important that congress understand that and that it has egh flexibility to earmark money or work out a hold harmless or do something which is necessary to do equity among the states and areas of the country.
. i ask unanimous consent that the summar report of the drug abuse council which i cited. an article in the new york times by walter sullivan. of july 9. 1975. entiled "marihuana study by united states finds serious harm." and an article in the new york times by leslie oelsner. july 13. 1975. and entitled "in a sometimes bitter fight. states and cities are easing malihuana laws." be printed in the record.
. our nation is confronted with critical and complex problems respecting health manpower: physician geographic and specialty maldistribution and our increasing reliance on graduates of foreign medical schools who are  u.s. citizens. the american taxpayers have been providing through unique capitation grant assistance increased financial support to americas medical. dental. and other health professions schools. unique because other professional or graduate schools receive funding support comparable to capitation grants. the institutions which educate this countrys medical. dental. and other health professionals consider themselvesand i believe appropriatelyto be a natural resource. thus deserving substantial. continuing federal funding from tax revenues. large* sums have already been expended by the government for these purposes. and the schools say more is needed. i agree. however. as legislators. i believe we must insure that the taxpayers dollars that support medical education at the same time guarantee to the people who are paying for such education that they are provided health care by the medical manpower pool. whose education they subsidizedand which profession is privileged to be exceptionally well financially rewarded. a recent editorial from the wall street journal of july 9. 1975. addresses itself to this vital health manpower issue and i ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the record.
i think the issue is clear. . the issue is clear. as to whether or  we should try to do whatever the senate wishes to do at a time when it could be malleable and responsive to substantive issues. or whether we should arbitrarily cut out every employer of three. should that mans life and health be in jeopardy because he happens to be in a small shop. members can very clearly declare themselves "yea" or "nay" on that issue.
. for some time i have been concerned about the lack of primary health care services in this countrya problem which is becoming increasingly apparent. this growing concern led me to instruct jay cutler. miity counsel to the committee on labor and public welfareof which i am ranking miity memberto have dr. david banta. a robert wood johnson health policy fellow with the institute of medicinewho served the miity professional staff of the committee. to survey medical schools in the united states respect to programs of primary care. it is my belief that medical schools must make a special effort in the development of the primary care physicianthe doctor who initially assesses and seeks to solvewith the patients best interests in mindas many of the patients health problems as possible. refers the patient to physician specialists and consultants as necessary. and assume ongoing responsibility for the patients health care. the complexity and scope of the problems in this area have only recently been explored by those concerned with health manpower education. solutions will require vigorous action on many levelsparticularly from our nations medical schools as they train our future physicians. the initial results of the survey focused on new york medical schools and were the survey was then extended at my direction so that each member of the senate can compare the programs in the medical schools in his state to the universe of medical schools. i ask unanimous consent that the results of the survey be printed in the record.
. upon reviewing dr. bantas survey. which indicates that only 1 of the 12 medical schools have a required clinical experience of any duration in primary care and only 3 others have remote site training. i have asked dr. banta to expand the scope of the survey to all medical schools and report on his findings. i believe this information will be of great value to the committee on labor and public welfare. as it considers various legislative proposals which seek to insure that federal funding for medical education will provide the requisite incentives to medical schools to contribute to the solution of the problems of shortages of primary care physicians. while the percentage of residents training in primary care is almost 40 percent. if residents in internal medicine. pediatrics. and obstetrics/gynecology are included. only 4 percent of the total are in family medicine residences. thus. while all would appear to qualify under the definition utilized. we must continue to be concerned about the issue of whether other than family medicine "specialists" will provide care in medically underserved areasfor we k there is a tendency for the internal medicine. pediatrics. and obstetrics/gynecology specialists to practice in urban areas.
. i rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by the senator from california. i agree there is a need for increased appropriations for the important re. search activity of all the institutes of th( national institutes of health. however i think the method the senator ha. chosen to accomplish this goal is fault. because he proposes that we take fron peter and pay paul. and paul in thi - case is fully as worthy and should 1 be cut down for this purpose. - at the same time it is important tha a the public and the scientific communit s realize the amount of major biomedics - research that is being funded under th n cancer program was over $300 millioi last year. t i share the concern that the othe i institutes which have traditionally sup. e ported basic biomedical research hay a  had their budget increased at ans 11 thing approaching the rate of increa for the cancer budget. however. tli scientific community should come i .t realize the extent of support by t cancer institute of basic. fundament le research. w with respect to basic research. ti n actual expenditures of grant funds fh )- good basic science program subjected i ig peer review and given high ratings hal e- actually increased remarkably durir i- the past 3 years. those responsible fb r. the cancer program have always recol i- nized the absolute necessity for strox fundamental science and for the increased funding of categorical basic research. both by the cancer institute and the other institutes of nih. and the fact is that the federal government is funding more excellent basic research today than at any time in the past.
and is it  also true that the basic purpose of the title is to make aids food and nutrition program better by bringing the u.s. universities into a more carefully defined. cooperative relationship with aid that takes into account the problems of both parties. but that the purpose of the title is  to provide indiscriminate support to the landgrant universities international activities.
. i have -joined with senator kennedy in introducing two bills: the federal drug and devices act. and the federal food and cosmetics act. the purpose of both bills is to stimulate productive discussion and widespread input into the complex subject or reorganizing and revitalizing the fda in its role of safeguarding the public interest with regard to drugs. medical devices. food. and cosmetics. let me emphasize that i am  doctrinaire with regard to the specific provisions of these bills. but i believe the introduction of the bills will provide the opportunity for response and comment from all interested parties. the chairman of the subcommittee on health. of the committee on labor and public welfareof which committee i am ranking miity memberhas assured me that hearings will  be held on this legislation before april 1976. i am convinced that this is imperative. to begin immediate action on the important issues contained in these bills. we will actively solicit comments and suggestions for precise legislative recom mendations from the major groups involved. such as the scientific community. suppliers and manufacturers. drug companies. consumer groups. and the general public. as of july 1975. the subcommittee on health had already held 12 days of hearings on the pharmaceutical industry and related matters this year. this is without regard to the six volumes of hearings-"examination of the pharmaceutical industry"-which had been compiled in the 93d congress. in addition. the select committee on small business. of which i am also the ranking miity member. held 10 days of hearings on related matters. as of july. in 1975. it is time to move forward. but we must move judiciously and wisely. the bills introduced today contain the following major provisions: first. to the existing fda structure would be reconstituted with two new separate and distinct units: the drug and devices administration. and the food and cosmetics administration. each of these new agencies would have a scientific division and an enforcement division. each would have specialized responsibilities and duties. and each would have an independent administrator under the jurisdiction of the secretary of health. education. and welfare. second. under the new agencies. the scientific division would have a significant number of positions reserved for scientists who are  career employees. in order to encourage broad input from the distinguished scientific experts outside the government. at the same time. career employees would be encouraged to spend sabbaticals in universities and research institutions to foster greater interchange of kledge and skills. third. establishment of a new fourth step in the drug approval process under the new drug and devices administration to allow carefully controlled largescale clinical trials of drugs before their introduction for general use. this seeks to respond to the problem of "druglag." but at the same time protect the public health. fourth. establishment of a national drug review board composed of outstanding scientists in the field of drug research. currently the fda has an emous missionwith a limited budget and a cumbersome administrative structure that has outgrown the complex and growing task of safeguarding the public interest in a wide range of areas. these bills address the deficiencies and hopefully. with the widespread input our subcommittee will seek on this legislation. we can jointly arrive at legislation which will assist the fda to deal with an ever increasing mandate for future concernsincluding enforcement. scientific testing standards. evaluation procedures. basic research and data systems. and expansion into new areas of legitimate public and governmental concern. by mr. kennedy (for himself.
. i wish to point out to the senate that this amendment avoids a very serious difference of view within our own committee on the one hand represented by senator kennedy. who has fought so long and so effectively for dealing with sickle cell disease and cooleys anemia. and senator williams and i who were very interested in a generic program respecting genetic diseases generally. which includes taysachs. by the way. by this resolution. which gives a priority to the earlier programs. those to which senator kennedy has been so devoted. and at the same time accommodates these other programs in which senator williams and i were interested. as well as senator kennedy. we have avoided a difference of view respecting a generic research effort and a categorical genetic diseasebydisease effort. the house has looked with favor upon what is done in this amendment. in that we have at the desk a bill which incorporates measures which i have sponsored with senator williams. and i think this is a splendid resolution of the problem. it illustrates the high degree of public responsibility which we seek to exercise in the committee on labor and public welfare. i am very gratified to commend it to the senate as working out something which could have caused us endless difficulties and seeming differences between senators such as senator kennedy and i. who have as much a common view as senators can have on these health problems. i hope the amendment will be adopted by the senate.
. the purpose of this amendment is to overcome changes in the periodic interim paymentpipprogram under medicare. pursuant to recently published regulations in the federal register. which would slow down payments to hospitals in the medicare program. the effect of the regulations will be a devastating blow to the critical cash flow situation of many of our nations hospitals. while the longer the delay in payment the greater the gain to the government that holds the money. the greater the loss is to the institutions that receive the funds. moreover. the institutions then have to borrow moneyif they canand pay interest on loans when they become cash short as a result of government delay in payment. i believe the congress can act to prevent shortchanging hospitals in this way and require by law that payment be prompt. the amendment i proposed achieves that result by amending section 1815 of the social security act with respect to payments to providers of services. it amends the law requiring providers to be paid "but  less often than monthly" by further requiring such payment to be "with greater lag in payment to the provider than occurs in the providers payments for the products and services it purchases." the amendment does  authorize hospitals to receive advances on which they will make a profitbut rather assures the medicare program will pay hospitals as promptly as hospitals pay their own bills. thus. the hospitals would  be compelled to go into debt to pay their bills. this is the effect of the amendment i am proposing. it is my view that the proposed amendment would be in accord with the legislative history of medicare that the program was to avoid "placing any financial burden upon hospitals by providing funds as nearly as possible after the time of providing services"-provider reimbursement manual paragraph 2407 of since the interest cost of the hospitals borrowingdue to delayed paymentsis ultimately shared by all of the hospitals patients. the proposed regulationwhich this amendment seeks to overcomeappears in conflict with section 1861 of the social security act which declares that medicare payors should  be made to bear any medicarerelated costs. while the amendment does  specify "payroll." it is intended that "payroll" is included within "services it purchases" as set forth in the amendment.
. sunday marked the 15th anniversary of the death of dr. tom dooley. the great american humanitarian. tom dooley was a navy medical officer who helped evacuate 610.000 indochinese refugees from th vietnam shortly after the fall of dienbienphu. he was horrified by their terrible suffering and resigned his commission in the navy to establish a crude hospital in laos. he was the only doctor in a nation of 3 million people. in 1957. tom dooley was instrumental in setting up medico which has played a major role in establishing hospitals in remote areas of africa and asia.  only did he dedicate his life to the people who needed him most. but dr. dooley also wrote and lectured widely to tell others of the human misery he saw and to help raise funds for his network of primitive hospitals. tom dooley died of cancer -in 1961 after compressing a hundred lifetimes of helping others into his 34 years. he left behind a legacy of spirit and compassion which helped provide the inspiration for the peace corps and similar organizations throughout the world. today. his work is being carried on by the dooley heritage. a private group dedicated to providing medical care to people in the remotest parts of the globe. we will ho many great americans during this bicentennial year. we should ho dr. tom dooley who aided his fellow man and displayed the flujest attributes of the american character.
s biomedical research panelestablished pursuant to legislation which i authored with senator kennedyhas focused on the need for objective data on the costs and benefits of budget allocation within biomedical research. in this regard. i commend to my colleagues attention the recent testimony of dr. clifton gaus of the social security administration before the panel. dr. gaus pointed out that costly new techogies are rapidly diffused in the health care system yet many years after introduction of many of these techogies. debate continues concerning their efficacy. he also points out that there are presently incentives in the medical care system to use resourcesaving techogy. and the hospitalbased nature of medical student and residency training encourages physicians to function in a way which demands much costly techogy. the evidence which dr. gaus cites concerning funding for biomedical research and the need for new techogies to be adequately assessed before they are diffused into medical care is provocative and deserves careful congressional consideration. i ask unanimous consent that the text of dr. gaus statement be printed in the record.
 has transmitted a message proposing the recission of $103. 159.000 in the fiscal year 1976 budget authority for health services programsincluding a recission of $3.750.000 for hypertension programs. i believe that in view of the extensive evidence submitted during the past year to encourage the development of prevention and treatment programs for persons suffering from hypertension. these funds are vital if we are to launch a successful comprehensive effort to treat all who are in need of medical attention for hypertension. the assistant secretary for health. dr. theodore cooper. has estimated that through such an effort "200.000 lives a year could be saved." a recent article in the medical tribune entitled "study shows hypertension longer a silent epidemic" points out that dr. robert levy. director of nihs national heart and lung institute has found thatmore than 9 million of the nations estimated 23 million adult hypertensiveswhile aware of having the disorderare receiving treatment whatsoever or  egh. i commend the article to the attention of my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
. by and with the advice and consent of the senate. is essential. the issues with respect to the programatic role of the national institute on drug abuse. as set forth in the bills passed by the house and the senate. were substantially similar. both bills confirmed and clarified its continued existence and authorized appropriations for its continued operation at the same levels-$45 million annually for 2 years for formula grants and $160 million annually for 2 years for project grants. i am pleased to e that particular provisions which i authored or supported in the bill have been retained. to wit: first. a provision calls for a prohibition against the director of the office holding two federal jobs--except respecting international negotiations. second. a provision regarding the need factor. which would require the secretary within 6 months to propose rulemaking respecting the formula used in making allocations. and. in determining a formulas need factor. by regulation. the secretary must establish a methodology to assess and determine the incidence and prevalence of drug abuse to be applied in determining need. third. a provision requiring determination of need before increasing minimum state formula allocations. fourth. a provision requiring grant applicants and state plans to provide proposed performance standards. or research protocol. to measure effectiveness of service. fifth. a provision requiring substate planning input. through modification of the appropriate provisions in the health planning law.
s biomedical research panel. established pursuant to legislation which i authored with senator kennedy. has focused on the need for objective data regarding costs and benefits of biomedical techogy. i would like to underline that outstanding health policy analysts and distinguished scientists are  alone in raising these concerns. rather. practicing physicians who seek the best for their patients are increasingly becoming aware that costly. unproven techogy can and does take away from the resources. time. and energy that ought more properly be devoted to the patient. i would commend to my colleagues two excellent articles: one is entitled "lets fall out of love with our new techogy." published in the february 1976 issue of medical ecoics by dr. robert ray mcgee. an internist from clarksdale. miss. dr. mcgee es that physicians should use medical techogy with discretion and critically assess its benefit for his or her individual patient. considering the patients individual circumstances. dr. michael halberstam. writing in the february 23. 1976. issue of american medical news. the newsletter of the american medical association. takes a critical look at the proliferation of techogy for its own sake in our nations teaching hospitals. dr. halberstam cites the distressing fact. uncovered in one study. that interns and residents frequently did  even check the results of tests they had ordered. dr. halberstam es that somehow the patient and his needs have all too often been overlooked. i ask unanimous consent that the articles by drs. mcgee and halberstam be printed in full in the record.
the administration is what is worrying me because. after all. this deficiency has been building. as a matter of fact. we in our committee have been concerned about giving additional responsibility to the fda. althdugh it might be absolutely essential. as we have already demonstrated. because we knew they could  carry it. it made us question it. we just went through. the other day. a conference on medical devices. successfully. and we are worried about it because we are giving them authority. it is very essential. it is all these devices. you k. including pacemakers and all of these delicate instruments. but. we do  k. they say they have got personnel to handle it. we are convinced they have . hence. the problem here.
. i urge my colleagues to support the clinical laboratories improvement act of 1976 . the bill marks a historic milestone in a national commitment to provide quality laboratory testing. laboratory testing occupies an increasingly important place in both diagtic and preventive medicine. by 1980. it is estimated that some 8.8 billion clinical laboratory tests will be conducted annually at the cost of about $15 billion. up from 4.4 billion tests at a cost of $12 billion in 1975. we are dealing with health and lives of millions of americansand every american is entitled to protection from inaccurate and unreliable lab tests. which in great measure result from the failure to regulate all laboratories. the bill extends the coverage of the clinical laboratories improvement act of 1967 (public law 90174). which i authored with senator george murphy of california. there would be licensure and establishment of quality standards for the approximately 15.000 independent and hospital laboratories which  operate essentially free of meaningful regulation. the 50.000 to 80.000 individual physicians offices laboratories   covered are also included. but. this is achieved through a el approach in the reported bill. which was based upon hearing testimony suggesting detailed information to be supplied by the physician to the department of health. education. and welfare. the principal feature of this new provision is the submission to the secretary of a shortform physicians affidavit which would include a description of. first. the qualifications of physician laboratory personnel employed in a physicians office laboratory. second. the score of proficiency testing examinations taken by such personnel. and third. the quality and type of the tests conducted. then. in accordance with such affidavit. the secretary would exempt such physician office laboratory and. at the same time. insure protection of the publics health. the labor and public welfare committee had the benefit of the excellent staff report prepared for the senate special committee on aging on the problem of fraud and abuse in clinical laboratories. in response to the committees staff and investigators conclusion "that clinical laboratory services under medicare and medicaid are fraught with fraud and rampant abuse" the bill as introduced was amended to provide: first. revocation or suspension of a license where it has been determined that an owner or operator of a laboratory. first. has offered. paid. solicited. or received any kickback or bribe in the form of money or any other thing of value in connection with the provision of clinical laboratory services. second. has engaged in any false. fictitious or fraudulent billing practice for the purpose of obtaining payment under any program. the funds for which are provided in whole or in part by the united states. and third. has engaged in a billing practice which creates a discriminatory effect between patients reimbursed in whole or in part under programs receiving federal funds and patients  so reimbursed. second. the license application contains an accurate itemized scheduleincluding common groupings of testsof all current rates charged for laboratory services and full disclosures of contractual relationships between the applicant and physicians respecting lab services. the provision of quality laboratory testing services is vital and the reported bill seeks to achieve that goal by prohibiting a laboratory from discriminating against an employee who alerts government officials about possible deficiencies that exist in the laboratory. the need for such a provision is perhaps best understood in the context of the tragic human consequences of inadequate laboratory testing. while the printed word is limited in portraying human suffering. to provide some insight into the human dimension of the need for quality laboratory performance standard. i call my colleagues attention to a few brief abstracts of actual case citations:
the pattern of the evolution to state jurisdiction remains the same. in other words. if a state is enforcing the standards of the secretary. then the state may take over the administration of the law. the extension represents the additional laboratories that are brought under the law. to wit. the approximately 15.000 independent and hospital laboratories which  operate essentially free of meaningful regulation. the previous act reached only the large commercial laboratories which engaged in interstate commerce. in addition. i say to the senator from nebraska. at the suggestion of senator stafford. of which we thoroughly approved. we exempted hospitals in rural areas absolutely for 2 years under such regulations as the secretary could design expressly for personnel. we waived the application of regulations relating to laboratory personnel in the rural hospital.
the physicians office laboratories are  exempted but are made subject to the annual affidavit requirement in which the requirements for giving information to the secretary are extremely limited. we essentially leave it to the physician. i will read that to the senator. we essentially leave it to the physician to police himself. and the whole purpose of the affidavit techniqueand really i think it is my business experience that leads me to thisis to bring to the attention of the physician his own laboratory so that. as he has to sign a piece of paper which says it is ok. and he will therefore take a good hard look at it. that is what we finally decided was the only way to go. may i read this to the senator.
it is a doctors suggestion. by the way. and i think it is a very good one. here is what it says: exceptionsthis is found at page 26 of the committee report. ... provides that the secretary may exempt clinical laboratories owned and operated by a licensed physician. dentist. podiatrist. or osteopath performing tests solely as an adjunct to treatment of his own patients. from provisions of this section under such conditions as the secretary may deem necessary to protect the public health. such exemptions may be granted only upon submission of an affidavit which includes: (1) a description. including education. experience. and training. of the physicianwe have quarrel with the physician. . . . of the physician personnel who participate in the conduct of tests. collection of specimens. or transmission of specimens. (2) the quantity and type of tests conducted by physician personnel. . . . again he conducts it. requirement. and (3) the results of the proficiency testing. if any. of these personnel. let me explain to the senator the use of that rubric "proficiency testing." it in essence relies upon the programs of those qualified national organizations. such as the college of american pathology and the american association of bioanalysts. that is what we mean when we use the words "proficiency testing" in the government. it is strictly in the hands of. for example. the pathologists themselves. and so what we want in an affidavit is the result of that particular physicians offices laboratory personnel which he ks because they would participate in these procedures gained through this testing system which the pathologists themselves carry out.
it will do absolutely hing to the office. if i can help it. because there is requirement whatever in this law as far as the physician is concerned. for any certificate. diploma. qualification. or anything else.
we left this to regulation because obviously. it is much too detailed to try to do in the statutes. but may i say to the senator. it is my distinct. purpose that at time shall there be anything but a performance standard requirement. that is. a standard of ability to perform as required and that there shall  be at any time any educational qualification or other qualification. other than a strict performance standard. my belief is that the regulations should go this way. it should really be done on a time basis. if a person has done the work satisfactorily for a period of time. that. ipso facto. should be accepted by the secretary as a basis for competence to continue. my thought isand i am  trying to substitute myself for the experts but all that i say is that i shall make it my business. and i will be responsible to the senate. that there is requirement for diploma. license. examination. or anything like that. but that it is strictly a performance standard. the ability to do the work. it is jobrelated. mr. cutler reminds me. but may i also say that there is requirement whatever on the physician. i hope the senator understands that. we accept the fact that a physician is subject to regulations of any kind or character. he is. ipso facto. competent and fully empowered because he is a physician. so there is absolutely qualification to that.
the natures of the errors were invariably findings as the result of the tests which simply did  jibe with what the findings should have been based upon competent tests. senator moss is waiting to speak. he has investigated this matter. and he has a host of comparable instances. the senator has the report to which senator kenwedy referred. in the federal government. the difficulty we have is that the testing problem has  proliferated to where the diagis is determined very heavily by multiple tests. as i explained. there are 4.4 billion tests a year. and within 5 years there will be 8.8 billion and the uniformity of testing is  here. so. in respect of the physician. i have tried. in working this outthe committee agreeingto exempt the individual physician from anything so far as we are concerned. we are talking only about physician personnel. we have really streamlined the thing down to the barest necessityone paper a year. more. and a very simple one. i have just read it second. and very important. i make it part of the legislative history and i pledge myself to the senatorand if he wants to take the time to do it. i will make it my businessto see that any regulation proposed is submitted to him. i would be happy to do that.
then. i will be more than happy if he will submit it to them. they will have more than adequate opportunity. as will the medical associations. and so forth. but i think it is characteristic of our situation that there is opposition here from the american medical association. who would be here yelling bloody murder if they were really worried about this matter.
i read from page 23 of the bill. line 6: "(1) the term laboratory or clinical laboratory means a facility for the blological. microbiological. serological. chemical. immuematological. hematological. biophysical. cytological. pathological. or other examination of materials derived from the human body. for the purpose of providing information for the diagis. prevention. or treatment of any disease or impairment of. or the assessment of the health of. man. or a facility for the collection. processing. and transmission of such materials for such purposes. other than a facility exclusively engaging in the collection. processing. or transmission of human whole blood ... i will  read the remainder of the language.
i give the senator an example. which is interesting. many of these tests require an identification of color. we do  k today whether a physician person is or is  colorblind. think of what could happen if you are supposed to read something based upon colorand you are. that is how elementary this thing becomes.
. i am pleased to cosponsor this legislation with senator iye that would provide reimbursement under medicare and medicaid for the services of psychiatric nurse specialists. as an architect of the nurse training provisions of public law 9463. i have long been convinced that nurses provide services that are crucial to all medical care. in all settings of health care practice. the nursing profession brings medical skill and personal attention to the population at large. the nursing profession continues to broaden its traditional roles in order directly to meet our nations most urgent health problems. as this country moves toward a national health insurance program. it becomes even more urgent that we develop reimbursement systems that will help to assure the quality and quantity of health services necessary effectively to serve the health care needs of all the people of this country. many of our citizens have too long been deprived of adequate health care simply because of geography or poverty simply because they happen to live in "underserved" rural or innercity areas where health services are existent or in short supply. one reason for this shortage is that in many instances health services rendered by providers other than physicians can be reimbursed under medicare and medicaid unless a doctor is physically present. professional nurses constitute the largest health care provider group in the country. and increasingly they are providing primary care. naturally they work in close collaboration with physicians. although  necessarily under the same roof at all times. one of the areas in which nurses have an outstanding record of performance is in psychiatricmental health care. the value of the services of psychiatric nurses has been apparent in our community mental health centers where they play a significant role in the planning and providing of care and in developing imaginative new programs. such as crisis intervention teams. psychiatric nurses function in many settings. and they provide a wide range of services from initial intake screening and evaluation. health teaching. home visits. consultation. to group. individual and family psychotherapy. i think it is to the advantage of mental health care in this country that these services be supported and their continued development encouraged. by mr. abourezk:
. i am delighted that with senator cranston. as well asthe today the senate will be considering s. bill  under consideration. and i 2548. the emergency medical services strongly support the contribution that amendments of 1976. which i introduced this program has already made and on october 22. 1975. with broad bipartiwould continue to make in addressing san support. and which has been sponmajor health needs of the american sored  by virtually all members of the people. committee on labor and public welfare these amendments provide for a con- as well as other leaders of the senate. tinuing federal program of support and to extend the authorizations of apguidance for a wide variety of public and propriations and make certain improvements in the emergency medical services systems act of 1973public law 93154. the ems act. which i authored in the senate. was enacted in ember 1973 with strong bipartisan support. that act added to the public health service act a new title xii for ems systems and research grants and contracts and added to title vii of that act a new section 776 for ems training grants.
 to sign. however. in an effort to reach such an accord and prompt re3olution of the issues respecting the health information and promotion. communicable disease and venereal disease titles of the bill. this provision was  incorporated into the compromise. i offer this amendment to the pendig hmo bill because the proven efficacy of flouridation in significantly reducing both the incidence of dental disease and the cost of its treatment is consistent with the hmo objectives of providing cost effective quality health care. the need for this amendment is set forth in the committee report in the senate passed s. 1466. it states as follows: 3. grants for water treatment programs: section 1718 of the committees bill provides a modest authorization of $9 million for communities which wish to seek partial federal assistance in order to treat their water supplies. the committee is convinced of the safety and effectiveness of fluoridation as a powerful preventive weapon in the battle against dental disease. the efficacy of fluoridation has been widely kn for many years. and the committee has received overwhelming testimony from both scientific and professional groups to this effect. dental caries is the most prevalent disease in the united states today and one of the most costly of all chronic diseases. by age two. approximately onehalf of the children in this nation have experienced tooth decay. by age fifteen. the average child has 11 decayed. missing or filled teeth. bringing the level of fluoridation in community water supplies to the optimum level is the safest. most effective. and most ecoical way to prevent tooth decay. fluoridation prevents 4060 percent of the dental caries usually experienced by children. the effects of fluoridation have been studied in the united states since 1945 and all communities involved have reported significant reduction in tooth decay as a result of this public health measure. fluoride occurs naturally in most water supplies and raising it to the optimum level to prevent tooth decay. usually one part per million. has never been proved to be hazardous to health. adjusting the fluoride content of the water will  increase the likelihood of cancer. heart disease. kidney disease. allergies. or any other physical or mental illness. indeed. fluoride is considered an essential trace element vital to proper nutrition. growth. and development. adjusting the fluoride level in a communitys water supply costs a maximum of 10 or 15 cents per person annually. it results in a 50 percent or more savings in a familys tion. $3050 can be saved in dental care dential bill. for every dollar spent on fluoridation. $30-$50 can be saved .n dental care costs. other methods for the prophylactic application of fluoride are available. however. e are as effective or as ecoical as fluoridation of drinking water. its benefits are conferred on everyone. regardless of socioecoic level. it is effective without the need for any action by the individual. a report released this year by the directorgeneral of the world health organization renewed that organizations support of water fluoridation and said that "unless there are overriding technical reasons. nation can afford the luxury of  fluoridating every central water supply system containing less than the optimum concentrations of fluoride." the who report affirmed that fluoridation of the water supply should be the cornerstone of any national program of dental caries prevention. the need for this provision is expressed by the professional organizations concerned with dental health care. as follows:
. with senators cranston and brooke as cosponsors. i introduce two bills. the national health insurance for mothers and children act. which i send to the desk for appropriate reference. and the comprehensive maternal and child health practice act. which i send to the desk for appropriate reference. and i ask unanimous consent that the full text of both bills be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. while i continue to support the enactment into law of the health security health act . it makes emously good sense both in human terms and as national policy to begin on the road to universal national health insurance with comprehensive health care for mothers and children. it is imperative to safeguard their health by providing accessible. comprehensive health services. at the same time. both the financial and organizational provisions of this legislation allow us to set into motion and to evaluate health systems with cost controls and a rational delivery system in which continuous. high quality health care may be provided. while we provide the means of increasing access of mothers and children to health care that emphasizes the prevention of disease and the promotion of health. we shall have the opportunity to prove out my conviction that universal national health insurance is  only feasible but desirable and will foster important improvements in the quality and costeffectiveness of the total health care system. the two bills work in tandem to do so. the two measures i introduce today build upon. modify. strengthen. and integrate bills to the same effect introduced separately by representatives james h. scheuer and andrew maguire. healthy mothers and healthy children represent the fruits of truly preventive health services that are rendered at a crucial time during the human life cycle. therefore. the children and mothers of our nation can wait for the promise of national health insurancea promise which has been on the legislative agenda for a long period of time. i believe the time is  for the congress to be the effective advocate for the health and well being of the mothers and children. it is time to invest together in our nations health future. the major provisions of the national health insurance for mothers and children act include: comprehensive ambulatoryincluding home health. rehabilitative. social and mental health servicesand hospital care for children from birth up to the age of 18 with incentives for preventive childrens health services included in the benefit package. all appropriate prenatal and postpartum health care for women. up to 12 weeks after childbirth. support servicestransportation. outreach. dependent carefor special populations or those persons determined to have a high risk of infant and maternal morbidity. only such limited cost sharing and special reimbursement incentives that would stimulate the development and acceptance by both provider and patient of maternal and child health group practices. payments for health professionals on the basis of specified and negotiated fee schedules. periodically adjusted according to such ecoic index or indices determined to be appropriate. payment for institutions according to budgets agreed to in advanceprospective budgeting. specific standards for health institutions and health professionals qualified for reimbursement under the maternal and child health programs. second consultation for certain surgical procedures. financing through payroll taxes and general revenues. the major provisions of the comprehensive maternal and child health practice act include: first. a program designed to foster the development of group practices for the delivery of maternal and child health care. second. grants. contracts and loan guarantees-$93.500.000 authorizedfor the initial planning and operational costs of group practices consisting of pediatricians. family practitioners. obstetricians/gynecologists and other health professionalssuch as nurse practitioners and nurse midwiveswho deliver maternal and child health services. third. medical malpractice reinsurance for claims brought against a comprehensive maternal and child health practice. fourth. the sum of $30 million authorized for health professions educational programs related to providing health care through comprehensive maternal and child health group practice. fifth. special consideration for assignment of national health service corps personnel to those practicing in comprehensive maternal and child health practices. s. 3592 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the "comprehensive maternal and child health practice act".
. at the request of the administration. i introduce their bill to provide indemnification against claims for injury related to iulation with vaccine under a comprehensive nationwide influenza immunization program. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and the department of hew letter of transmittal be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. the bill in essence would authorize the secretary of health. education. and welfare to agree. in contracts for the purchase of vaccine in connection with the national influenza immunization program. against claims attributable to iulation with the vaccine. except claims arising out of the negligence of the manufacturers. while the possibility of any injury occurring. or the vaccine manufacturers being held liable for such injury is believed. to quote the letter of transmittal. "extremely remote." there is concern expressed by the vaccine manufacturers that. under recent court decisions. the possibility exists. in the absence of this proposed legislation. that a vaccine manufacturer could be successfully sued for injuries resulting solely from the federal governments activities in the immunization program. while it appears from the letter of transmittal that the department and the manufacturers agree that the manufacturers should be responsible for possible injuries resulting from their negligence. if any. in manufacturing the vaccine. whereas the federal government should be liable for injuries arising from any failure to perform properly those aspects of the program over which it has control. i am concerned about the need to extend indemnification to everyone who participates in the administration and delivery of the vaccine to the public. as all the states prepare to participate in the nationwide. federally sponsored swine flu iulation program. we must  only examine carefully the relationship between the vaccine manufacturers and their insurers who have allegedly  declined to insure the manufacturers. but also the need to extend any such protection to the states and to all the doctors. nurses. and other volunteer health professionals who participate in the iulation program. 8.3614 be it enacted by the senate and the house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that section 311 of the public health service act is amended by adding at the end of that section the following new subsection (d): "(d) the secretary of health. education. and welfare may agree. as part of any contract for the purchase of a vaccine for a comprehensive nationwide influenza immunization program. to indemnify the manufacturer of the vaccine against claims attributable to iulation with the vaccine except claims for failure of the manufacturer to exercise due care in the manufacture or handling of the vaccine in accordance with ithe contract specifications or for failure to discharge properly any other obligation under the contract. hing herein shall be construed as creating or changing any rule of liability under any law of the united states or of any state."
. i urge my colleagues. as ranking miity member of the labor and public welfare committee. to support the health professions educational assistance act. s. 3239. of which i am a coauthor. the bill has been fashioned after considerable study of how most effectively to provide for an adequate and appropriate supply and distribution of physicians and other health professionals essential to americas health and wellbeing. the bill identifies and seeks to solve the three major health manpower problems plaguing our nation: first. the geographic maldistribution of health professionals. especially of physicians and dentists. second. the maldistribution of physicians by specialty. third. the excessive reliance upon physicians who are graduates of foreign medical schools and who often are  as well prepared to practice medicine as their u.s. counterparts. the solutions to the first two problems are achieved by the bills provisions that. in essence. condition receipt of federal capitation upon the medical schools aggregate cooperation with the following goals : first. a phasedup percentage setaside of their enrollment for students who volunteer to receive national health service corps. nhsc. scholarships and who are prepared to provide careupon completion of their educationin the nhsc. in medically underserved areas. and second. a phasedup percent of their affiliated residencies in primary care. i believe that the expansion of the highly successful and voluntary national health service corps scholarship and subsequent service program is a creative and constructive approach to meeting the health care needs of underserved populations. also. i believe that gradually shifting the balance in affiliated residencies from specialty to primary care fields effectively responds to specialty maldistribution when it is accomplished together with the national council on postgraduate physician training. established pursuant to a separate title of the bill. with respect to the third critical problemexcessive reliance upon physicians who are graduates of foreign medical schoolsthe bill closes down. over time. the inequities in the immigration and naturalization law that perpetuate the problem. a gradual response is necessary to assure fairness to the professionals involved and  to disrupt crucial patient care needs that fmgs are presently filling. otherwise we would have a health care catastrophe in many of our large urban centers. the nature and scope of these problems is evidenced and documented throughout the hearing record.
if i may use my additional minute. . but we hope very much that we have found the way in which to work out a difference in view which was very basic. relating to the participation by medical teaching institutions in the establishment of a way in which to better apportion the available talent to medical specialties. especially as they concern residencies and relate to primary care practice. which apparently is the place where the great squeeze comes. if senator abourezk will allow us to proceed with that. i am hopeful we can work out a reconciliation of these views this very morning
in a moment. i shall pffer it shortly. . upon reflection i find myself in agreement with the distinguished chairman of the health subcommittee and coauthor of this legislation. senator kennedy. his amendment to my amendment calls attention to an important distinction that can be made between national policies regarding geographic maldistribution and specialty maldistribution. while these problems are related in our health professions education system. as senator kennedy es. they are by means identical. and therefore there are different approaches to dealing with them. i believe senator kennedy is right in saying that the national health service corps scholarship program is so attractive that many. many qualified and dedicated young people will want to participate in the program. while the problem of geographic maldistribution is urgent. for scholarships the approach embodied in aggregate national goals. rather than a schoolbyschool basis. is likely to work and certainly ought to be encouraged. however. with respect to specialty maldistribution. the issue is  the career decisions and educational choices of individual students but. rather. the responsiveness of institutions in meeting national needs for increases in primary care practitioners. it is easy to imagine a limitless pool of young people who would. in exchange for scholarship support. wish to enter the corps program and serve in medically underserved urban and rural areas throughout the nation. on the other hand. it would be wasteful. costly. and extremely unfortunateand unresponsive to peoples actual health care needsif primary care house staff training positions and -specialty house staff training positions were skewed or bunched or geographically maldistributed. i am. therefore. gratified that senator kennedys amendment retains the feature of affiliated residencies on an individual basis. thereby achieving the broad outline of residency distribution about which the professi6nal community has dispute. i hope that my distinguished colleague from maryland (senator beall). could join with me in accepting this amendment by senator kennedy. i believe it reflects our mutual aspirations.
. i have a unanimous consent request related to a bill we passed this morning. it is a technical problem which arose. senator kennedy has cleared it. i ask unanimous consent that my unprinted amendment  162. as agreed to as an amendment to the beall amendment  1952 to the bill entitled the "health professions educational assistance act of 1976" be substituted in lieu of that part of the kennedy unprinted amendment  160 relating to capitation conditions for schools of medicine and osteopathy.
. i have some questions i would like to ask the senator. i ask them very sympathetically because the senator ks that. with senator moss of utah. i was the i author of the first alcoholism bill which became law here. and i would also like to say to senator mcclellan. when i was a member of the judiciary committee. very effective provisions were written - into the law dealing with this question. * first. does the senator in his amendment include research also or is this confined to the effort to abate the excess abuse of alcohol by the individual.
. i ask unanimous consent that there be included in my remarks as exhibit 1 a report on my visit to various international organizations in geneva. ably the staff of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. the gatt. the staff of the international labor organization. the ilo. to which we have served ice of withdrawal. and my comments on the consequences of that which. on the whole. i think have been beneficial. and my visit to the world health organization. the who. similarly located in geneva. and to the united nations fund for drug abuse control to which we contribute about threequarters of its resources because of our great interest in the control of drug abuse. and to the world food organization. the world food program. and the world food council in rome.
yes. that is all right. the reason is this: the swine flu vaccine is a national program advanced by the president in response to critical and important scientific evidence that there is the threat of that kind of an epidemic. . i would like to ask the majority leader for his advice because i may be in error as to-
that letter. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the floor statement of senator kennedy. chairman of our health subcommittee. who conducted the hearings and generally carried on the role of leadership in respect to this particular legislation. as he has done consistently with respect to important health legislation to protect and improve the health of the american people. he is momentarily detained at home because of trouble with his back but i would like his role. his leadership role. in respect to this particular legislation to be very clear and precise.
i have heard the amendment. and the senator is gracious to allow me to speak. mally. if one says. "well. an amendment is unnecessary because this is what we say." a senator can respond. "if it is unnecessary to say what you say. why  include it." our problem is that we have negotiated with so many people. including the appropriations committee. that i hope the senator may be content if i. as more or less the manager of this measure 26636 co: in senator kennedys absence. give my assurance. and i ani sure senator williams will join me. and which is borne out by the body of what we are doing. let me furnish proof to the senator: on page 2 of our substitute which is at the desk. subsection (f) deals with the question of written. informed consent. every individual to whom this vaccine is to be administered must give a writtkn. informed consent. and the definition of the informed consent is contained in the amendment. and calls for the information necessary to advise individuals with respect to their rights and remedies arising out of the administration of such vaccine. then i have put in the record the presidents letter. upon which this whole action is based. of august 4. 1976. in which the president says. at the end of the second paragraph of that letter which is already in the record--let me read the whole paragraph: since that timereferring to march and april of this year. when the president first approached mehew. working with the medical profession. state and local health officials. vaccine manufacturers. and other groups. have developed extensive plans to see to it that our original goal of making this vaccine available to all americans can be met. i would like to repeat that. it is critical to what the senate is seeking to do: to see to it that our original goal of making this vaccine available to all americans can be met. therefore. i say to the senator advisedly. as the comanager of the bill on the floor. that this paragraph is entirely voluntary. it is  mandatory. and it is based exclusively upon the informed written consent of any american who wishes to subject himself to it. having said that. i would express the personal hope that citizens. in their own interests and in the interests of patriotism for the whole country. would seriously and affirmatively consider entering into the program. but there is element of mandate. force. or constraint of any kind.
there is question. i just said that. myself. as to the diversion of the money for medical research. that -is what the appropriations committee has already considered. although the bill has  yet come before the senate. we -may like it. we may . we may challenge the committee and defeat it.
. i am here this morning. as are so many others. to pay tribute to john pastore. very much alive and kicking. which is characteristic of him and still with many years of wonderful living in him. this is a sentimental occasion. as i have served with him ever since i have been here. 20 years. we have been through a lot of agonizing and many gratifying legislative battles. i want to recall just two instances that i hope pleased him and will make him remember glowingly events of the past. one is a debate that he had here during the arduous civil rights debates of the sixties with russell long. of louisiana. in which russel stated the great philosophy of the social order of the south in terms of the black woman who raised him in her arms. cradled him in her arms. senator pastore. in his usual striking way. characterized that. as it was. a very limited view. certainly in history. he pointed out that he. too. was raised by a woman. who happened to be whitealso in her arms necessarily his mother. and that it did  really represent any social order which could replace constitutional guarantees. it was so touching. so eloquent. such a moving event. that i hope he will recollect it. read the record on it. and enjoy it time and time again as the years go on. the other memory i have of senator pastore is that he has saved us so much time in the chamber. his unique function of rising at precisely the critical moment to find out what we are doing. why we are doing it. and why we are spending so much time on it has. time and again. saved us anguished days and nights and enabled us to do many other things. often many other more pleasant things. his unique position in this chamber has been epitomized by the fact that one would ever think he was officious or patronizing or too big for his britches. or trying to do anything but what we would expect of john pastore. to be  only a father to his people. but a father to his fellow senators. so i say to him as an old friend. i feel a dear friend. who ha suffered with him. through his illness rejoiced in his comeback physically. i say: you are a great gamecock. john pastore.  it is time. for a little while. to go home to your loving wife and family. godspeed. i thank the senator.
. on september 23. 1976. the health subcommittee of the labor and public welfare committee. of which i am ranking miity member. conducted hearings on the federal governments responsibility for the supply of critically important vaccines and the need to develop a national vaccine policy. such a national policy was necessary with respect to the issues surrounding informed consent and immunization. the problems of vaccine manufacture and production. the problems associated with liability and indemnification. a review of the processes of research and development with a view toward future identification of vaccine preparations available for general use. the role of and responsibility for professional and public education on vaccine utilization as a disease prevention strategy. and the use of public information techniques to acquaint health professionals and the public with these matters. as part of a national vaccine policy it was also clear that special policies with regard to specific diseases. such as poliomyelitis. would need to be developed. the first witness at the hearings was dr. jonas salk. an historic figure and el prize winner in this particular field. his thoughtful views on the issues provide an important scientific basis upon which policy decisions may be made. i commend his testimony to the atten.tion of my colleagues and ask unanimous .consent that the full text of his prepared statement before the health subcommittee of the labor and public welfare committee be printed in the record.
. with senators cranston. brooke. and humphrey. as cosponsors i introduce the national health insurance for mothers and children act. which i send to the desk for appropriate reference. and i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and a summary be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
the companion bill in the house was introduced by representative scheuer and more than 20 cosponsors. . while i continue to support the enactment into law of a comprehensive national health scheme for all americans. it makes emously good sense both in human terms and as national policy to begin on the road to universal national health insurance with comprehensive health care for mothers and children. the mothers and children of this nation are the foundation of our nations strength. productivity and prosperity. it is time to begin to fulfill one of their great needsthe equal right to health care. whether rich or poor. health care should be a right.  a privilege. the provision of adequate and accessible health care regardless of ecoic status is. in my judgment. an imperative in the pursuit of social justice. only justice and morality should determine whether one lives or dies.  ecoic circumstances. it is imperative. therefore. to safeguard the health of mothers and children by providing accessible. comprehensive health services. at the same time. both the financial and organizational provisions of this legislation allow us to set into motion and evaluate health delivery with cost controls and a rational delivery system in which such continuous. high quality care may be provided. while we provide the means of increasing access of mothers and children to health care that emphasizes and fosters the prevention of disease and the promotion of healthrather than illness carewe shall have the opportunity to prove out my conviction that universal national health insurance is  only feasible but desirable and will foster important improvements in the quality and costeffectiveness of the total health care system. the major provisions of the national health insurance for mothers and children act include: comprehensive ambulatoryincluding home health. rehabilitative. social and mental health servicesand hospital care for children from birth up to the age of 18 with incentives for preventive childrens health services included in the benefit package. all appropriate prenatal and postpartum health care for women. up to 12 weeks after childbirth. support servicestransportation. outreach. dependent carefor special populations or those persons determined to have a high risk of infant and maternal morbidity. only such limited cost sharing and special reimbursement incentives that would stimulate the development and acceptance by provider and patient of maternal and child health group practices. payments for health professionals on the basis of specified and negotiated fee schedules. periodically adjusted according to such ecoic index or indices determined to be appropriate. payment for institutions according to budgets agreed to in advanceprospective budgeting. specific standards for health institutions and health professionals qualified for reimbursement under the maternal and child health programs. second consultation for certain surgical procedures. financing through payroll taxes and general revenues. a $93 million grant. contract and loan guarantee program designed to foster the development of group practices for the delivery of comprehensive maternal and child health care. medical malpractice reinsurance for claims brought against such a comprehensive maternal and child health group practice. $30.000.000 is authorized for health professions educational programs related to providing health care through comprehensive maternal and child health group practices. special consideration for assignment of national health service corps personnel to those practicing in comprehensive maternal and child health practices. the measure i introduce today builds upon. modifies. strengthens and integrates the bills introduced separately by representatives james h. scheuer and
. as the ranking miity member of the labor and public welfare committee. predecessor to its newly named successor committee. the committee on human resources. i understand amendment  37 introduced by senator long. chairman of the committee on finance. it makes clear that one could contend in the future that when the word "health" was added in the text involving the jurisdiction of the human resources committee. the jurisdiction of the fnance committee respecting national health insurance legislationwas to be limited to the tax provisions thereof. also. as i understand the use of the words "specific tax or trust fund" in the amendment it refers to a "specific tax or trust fund" to finance the health programs as expressed in the amendment specifically. it is very important that this be clear because the jurisdiction of the new human resourccs committeea jurisdiction exercised by its predecessors. the committee on labor and public welfaremust be clearly understood to include the organization and delivery of preventive health care. mechanisms in the health programs. medical and related health professional services. episodic illness care. continuing education of physicians and other health professionals. medical malpractice. medical research programs. medical ethics. peer review in health and comparable problems. i do  anticipate in view of the many precedents already established any problems in the relations between the finance committee and the new human resources committee. each of which has an important role in developing the most effective national health programs for the american people. i believe we have already charted the way to work together by the joint referrals of the national health insurance bills introduced to date. s. 3. s. 218 and s. 370 and i see .hing in the amendment to change the results of our experience.
. as ranking miity member of the human resources committee and a member of its subcommittee on health and scientific research. i am particularly pleased to support h.r. 4975. the health assistance programs extension act of 1977 which contains many important public health provisions. i would like to call your attention specifically to one amendment i authored which is contained in the bill. it guarantees that for admission into the third year of a u.0. medical school. u.s. citizens who have graduated from 2year u.s. medical schools will be treated the same as u.s. citizens who have completed 2 years of a foreign medical school. without this provision u.s. graduates of 2year u.s. medical schools are discriminated against. this amendment assures equity for both groups of students and the same opportunity to compete for the available spaces in the third year of u.s. medical schools. also this legislation continues essential programs of community health services. family planning and genetic diseases. it also increases the opportunity for public hospitals to meet their obligations for safe and effective facilities and services for their beneficiaries by providing an authorization of an additional $135 million in grant specifically for these facilities to eliminate or prevent imminent safety hazards or avoid compliance with state or voluntary insurance or accreditation standards. i am especially gratified that the committee recognized this special need that is especially acute in the new york city public facilities. i strongly support the passage of this essential health legislation that will benefit all americans.
: i believe that. first. we should e that there is $1.3 million in the supplemental appropriations bill. signed here recently which is designed to take up some of the slack in the heavily impacted states which will be again denied funds through the hold harmless provision. the senator from maine has already stated that he strongly favors implementation of the need factor and that goes a long way to allay my concerns about this amendment. i ask him whether he would concur with me that it would be only fair in the process of  penalizing these 31 states to which he will be referring in his amendment and also for us. to do our utmost to bring up the appropriation. and it will take about $8 million. so that the states which are heavily impacted by alcoholism and alcoholics do  suffer.
when the senator says "that information" then he just doubles back on his amendment. in other words. the senator assumes that feasibility requires substantial proof on each of these items. i can so read it. as the senator himself has said we are on the horns of a dilemma between ecoic results and the health and life of the individual worker. i will say it is my judgment that it would be pertinent and relevant under the heading of feasibility to adduce proof as to the cost impact on the consumers. wage earners. businesses. as well as governmental subdivisions. as to the impact on productivity. on competition. perhaps. you k. between one metal and aher metal or between one metal and a substitute. on the adequacy of supply. on questions of employment. on the utilization of energy. all of these. it seems to me. would be relevant factors. but by means does anybody have to bear a burden of proof about them in order to demonstrate the feasibility of a standard because the feasibility of a standard would also require balancing those personal ecoic considerations as far as the worker is concerned with the health and safety of the worker. but i am perfectly willing to state that. but i would certainly consider each of these questions pertinent and relevant in the mal case to the issue of feasibility. but. as i say. i would  consider it necessary that the secretary have any burden about it. they could be adduced by those who would challenge the standard as relevant information on the question of feasibility but.  constat. the secretary could still hold the standard feasible. balancing in a quantitative and a qualitative basis these considerations as against the health and safety of the worker. that is as far as i would go.
well. for one thing. the secretary can agree with the states to promote improvement of state workmens compensation and occupational disease laws in programs relating to mine management. for aher. the secretary could agree with the state to promote federalstate coordination and cooperation in improving the health and safety conditions in the mine. for a third. the secretary could agree with the state respecting more stringent. as the expression is. health and safety standards applicable to mines in that particular state. also. and finally. he could assist such a state in developing and enforcing effective mine health and safety laws and regulations. provided that they are consistent with the provisions of the federal legislation. which is what i have said right along. that is the whole point. i am  interested in fending with the senator.
well. i am sorry. but i obviously have . because the state could provide by agreement with the secretary for six inspections a year. for example. instead of four. and to enforce identical or more stringent safety and health standards.
well. that is health and safety. the state may provide for dealing with illnesses which the federal government may  be dealing with in its mandatory standards at all. we believe there are a host of such illnesses which have  been discovered. there is a doctor in new york named selikoff who works in mt. sinai hospital. who thinks these number in the hundreds. and that millions of americans are adversely affected by these hundreds of occupational diseases.
that is correct. one miner who accompanies the inspector. that is all we say. may i read the section to the senator. this starts at page 98. line 8: "(e) subject to regulations issued by the secretary. a representative of the operator and a representative authorized by his miners shall be given an opportunity to accompany the secretary or his authorized representative during the physical dnspection of any mine under subsection (a) for the purpose of aiding such inspection and to participate in pre- or postinspection conferences held at tlhe mine. where there is authorized miner representative. the secretary or lis authorized representative shall consult with a reasonable number of miners concerning matters of health and safety in the mine. such representative of miners who is also an employee of the operator shall suffer loss of pay as a result of his participation in the inspection made under this subsection. i construe that to relate back to lines 9 and 10 which speak of "a representative authorized by his miners." that representative is the one referred to in line 18 of the bill which relates to compensation for "such representative of miners who is also an employee of the operator." so i believe that on each inspection by an inspector a miner who is authorized by his miners shall have that opportunity without loss of pay. then at the bottom of page 98 there is an additional sentence. this goes on to read as follows. and i think we should read the whole thing: such representative of miners who is also an employee of the operator shall suffer loss of pay as a result of his participation in the inspection made under this subsection. to the extent that the secretary or authorized representative of the secretary determines that more than one representative from each party would further aid the inspection. he can permit each party to have an equal number of such additional representatives. however. only one such representative of miners who is an employee of the operator shall be entitled to suffer loss of pay as a result of such participation under the provisions of this subsection. it seems to me that this language makes clear what the entitlement provision is all about.
. the difficulty with the position taken by my distinguished colleague from th carolina is that he wishes to have us adopt a standard which is  up to the standard of this bill. a reading of the amendmentand one must always read the amendmentindicates that the standards to be adopted by the states in order to qualify for state adminstration are only the mandatory standards for metallic and metallic mines. those mandatory standards for safety and health are inadequate and are stated to be inadequate by the report of the comptroller general on june 10. 1977. in addition. the amendment provides for just one inspection annually of each mine. when the committee bill requires four in underground mines and two in surface mines. i give that only as an illustration of why we can allow the states simply to take over federal administration. what i have stated. and senator williams and i have concurred. is that. by agreement with the secretary of labor. a state can have a rolean important role. a critical rolein administering the law within its state. provided the federal presence is preserved. and that is all we ought to do. i hope the amendment is defeated.
i think the difficulty is caused by the inartistic language.  by the purpose. let me try to analyze it with the senator. "in making his investigations of accidents"-and if the senator stopped there. he would have to say "relating to safety in a mine." that would have a direct connectionaccidents and safety. what about health. for example. this bill covers uranium mines. what would be done about radioactivity. so some word has to be used other than "accident." i think "occurrences" is a poor word. we have used "circumstances relating to health" because what is essential to properly interpret "occurrences" is the phrase "relating to health or safety in a mine under the act." so i thoroughly agree with the senator. there may be occurrence whatsoever. but insidious influences may be killing a worker. without any occurrence. that is the thing that i think the language should take care of. therefore. for myself. i would say that an exact description would be: "in making his investigation of accidents relating to safety or other circumstances relating to health in a mine under this act. the secretary may." that is really the literal meaning of what we are talking about.
i like the senators word better than mine. i used the word "circumstances." and the senator used the word "conditions." let us strike "occurrences" and insert "conditions." so the amendment would read "or other conditions relating to health or safety."
. i commend to the attention of my colleagues a thoughtful speech by a distinguished health ecoist. anne a. somers. ph. d.. professor in the department of community medicine and department of family medicine of the rutgers medical school. dr. somers speech was presented as the sixth william c. menninger convocation lecture at the 130th annual meeting of the american psychiatric association. which was held may 26. 1977 in toronto. canada. dr. somers speaks with forceful insight on the health care of the american people and the need for the private and public sectors to work together in a dynamic. collaborative manner for the public good. i support the goal articulated by dr. somersto achieve public accountability through the reshaping of some of our priorities and "public goal setting and privatesector implementation." in medicine. dr. somers asserts. more emphasis must be placed on prevention. primary and longterm care. and the formulation of a national health policy. she says that psychiatry. because of its pioneering efforts in reducing hospitalization. in prevention of illness. and in treating patients in the community. is in a unique position to lead this type of effort. i congratulate the american psychiatric association for the theme of their annual meeting. "professional responsibility and public trust." it was most timely. i ask unanimous consent that the text of dr. somers convocation lecture be printed in the record.
the reason why i have always supported this program is that i think it will help us end. in many cases. the syndrome of the poor. which is based on failure to understand and accommodate to their own status in society and their own opportunities. so i would like to ask the senator this question: is the senator  satisfied that. over the years. they have eliminatedand i feel they havemany of the kind of class action and agitation aspects to which he refers. and that we are  down to the hardpan of legal action. and therefore we need-
. i think the key point all of us must emphasize is that there is a stay on the barring of saccharin. and i believe. senator kennedy. if he will hear me. that between us we can see that action was taken prejudicial by that stay by the fda until we could present the matter to the senate and the senate could act. in other words. october 1 seems to be plenty of time. but if for any reason it is . i think it would be our duty to see that that stay was extended to accommodate the senate action. perhaps the whole congressional action. and i just want to suggest to senator kennedy. who has been the very gifted chairman of the health subcommittee. that we might. perhaps. be able to give that kind of assurance to the proponents of this amendment and. thereby. just establish the fact that there would be prejudice. because of the fact that the amendment would  be pressed on this bill. i might say for myself. because i do  wish to leave the matter obscure. that i am inclined to agree with my colleagues on the committee. those of them who do feel that way. that precipitate action should be taken. i am  sure about 18 months. i am very sure about the fact that it ought  to be a rider on this bill. it takes a much more considered judgment. i am also convinced that when we do report legislation it ought to have appropriate conditions. for example. the advertising business is jumping up and down. newspapers. radio. television. "what are we going to do about that." and so. on. these are all considerations which we will develop in the legislation. so. in sum. my hope would be that this amendment would  be pressed. that the committee would have an opportunity to work its will. and that assurances would be given that the ban would  take effect until congress had had ample opportunity to act. right  that is the frame of reference. october 1. but. if necessary. to extend that further. i have every confidence we could do it within reasonable compass of time.
exactly. and the term "medically necessary" is very widely used. the senator has mentioned the social security act. as a matter of fact. we use it in the grant for medicare. that is. we authorize grants for medicare to meet the cost of necessary medical services. it is in the peer review act. it is in the hospital utilization act. they are very widely used words of art. i would say it would have to be a serious and goodfaith medical finding by a doctor that it is necessary in this particular case for sound medical reasons to abort.
. as many of my colleagues k. an issue of great concern both to senator kennedy and to myself is the rising cost of health care. the problems associated with this issue are highly complex. and. as with most complex issues. the number of questions greatly exceeds the number of answers and solutions. currently congress is considering a proposal for hospital cost containment submitted by the administration. while hospital costs are certainly one of the major contributors to the health cost spiral. they are by means the only contributor. other factors which play a significant role include third party reimbursement. advancing techogy. and a growing pool of health manpower. in an effort to examine closely both the problem and alternative solutions. senator kennedy and i recently cosponsored a conference with national journal "controlling health care costsa national leadership conference." during that conference. senator kennedy addressed the opening general session. i ask unanimous consent that senator kennedys remarks before this conference be printed in the record.
. the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1977s. 705is legislation designed to improve the performance standards of all clinical laboratories in order to assure that the highest quality of health care is rendered in these facilities. s. 705 amends the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967p.l. 90174---which authorized the secretary of health. education. and welfare to regulate clinical laboratories which operate in interstate commerceby expanding the existing licensing provisions to encompass all such laboratories within the federal jurisdiction. this new authority would include some 14.000 independent and hospital based clinical laboratories. and the approximately 50.000 to 80.000 medical laboratories located in physicians offices for which there are special certification procedures only. the need for this legislation stems from the recognition that while the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967 raised the standards of laboratory performance in the large interstate laboratories. many of the problems and deficiencies which provided the impetus for the first law continued to trouble the remaining unregulated laboratories. such deficiencies include poor quality medical laboratory testing practices which. too often. have resulted in severe consequences to patients. ranging from permanent disability to death. and widespread fraud and abuse practices shown by successive investigations. particularly in relation to reimbursement through medicare and medicaid. this bill seeks to remedy that situation. congress considered similar amendments to clia of 1967 at the end of the 94th session. that bill was passed by an overwhelming margin64 to 11by the senate. unfortunately. due to a heavy legislative calendar at the end of the session. the measure failed to be acted on by the house of representatives. the bill before us today is. with a few modifications made in response to testimony at hearings held this year essentially the same as that which passed the senate last year.
. i wish to take this opportunity to commend both the ford foundation and dean mckay for their continuing leadership in this important effort to implement national public policy. strong commitment to the support of litigation activities is indispensable to the continued health and success of the civil rights movement: exlrsrr 1
. is the essence. it is borne out by the fact that the department of hew is unanimous on the need for a label. the under secretary of health. education. and welfare. hale champion. urges that any legislation imposing a moratorium on regulatory action by the fda against saccharin require that a warning statement regarding potential health risks be included in all advertising and labeling of saccharincontaining production. there is a comparable statement by michael pertschuk. chairman of the federal trade commission. donald kennedy. commissioner of food and drugs. and donald frederickson. director of the national institutes of health. i ask unanimous consent that these statements be printed in the record.
to summarize. the issue is this: those who need saccharin for health reasons are going to take it. they. evidently. are willing to take the risk. but the warning is imperative for other people who do  have such needs. i hope very much. therefore. that the senate will be persuaded that the position of the committee which has jurisdiction over health mattersto wit. the committee on human resources--ought to be the position that prevails
. every employer may  clearly understand that the committee says that he may require. so long as it is discriminatory. in any disabilitypregnancy or any other disabilityinspection by a doctor. good faith. which is required on the part of the beneficiary. and a real illness or disability rather than one that is feigned cr pretended or extended without proper medical cause. so it seems to me that this is very adequate protection for the employer. what is just as important. it is very adequate protection for other employees. i am  unmindful of the fact that a plan is costly. that it becomes more costly if it is cheated on or imposed upon. and that. therefore.  only the employer but also other employees have a reason why they. too. have an interest in controlling possible abuse. i heard what the senator said about new jersey. i have idea why the public policy of new jersey or the practicalities of its own legislative enactments may have induced it to take this step. but i consider it quite inconsistent with the legislative purpose we are seeking to serve here and with the federal law which we should have on the subject.
. today i am introducing with my distinguished colleague. senator kennedy. an amendment to the health professions educational assistance act of 1976. the amendment pertains to a provision which requires medical schools as a condition of capitation to enroll students who are u.s. citizens in foreign medical schools. who have completed 2 years of training in such schoolsand were enrolled by october 12. 1976and who have passed part i of the national board of medical examiners examination. by including this provision in the law. it was believed that the quality of care in the united states could be significantly upgraded if this particular group of students was provided with the opportunity of finishing their medical education in u.s. schools where. it is believed. the quality of education exceeds that of schools anywhere else in the world. this provision. however. has met with severe criticism by the medical schools on the grounds that it violates the principle of academic freedom which guarantees the right of these institutions to determine without interference who shall be admitted to study. this objection is well substantiated. since the law does  allow the schools to use their own academic standards or admissions policies to determine which of these students shall be admitted. in my opinion. it was  the intent of congress to vitiate this principle. consequently. i believe the law should be modified to conform to the individual standards of the educational institutions. in this way the proposed amendment has the effect of addressing the medical schools concerns while still providing an opportunity for many of the students to transfer. basically. the amendment requires that all medical schools increase their third year enrollments by 5 percent of their first or third year classes. whichever is less. during the 197879 school year. furthermore. it places some restrictions on who is eligible to be counted under the enrollment increase in order to insure that most of these newly created slots are filled by young men and women who are students in foreign medical schools. i believe this approach has the effect of -removing the objectionable provisions in the current law while still allowing many of the students who have already qualified under the existing law to transfer. also i believe the amendment will be useful in addressing the original concerns of the congress relating to quality of care. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. before closing. i would like to add that several special problems relating to programs in preventive medicine. preventive dentistry and dental public health. and nutrition have been brought to my attentionproblems which directly affect established programs and appeal to my judgment of need. because prevention and nutrition are vitally important to the health of americans. i feel it is particularly important to address these problems as soon as possible. therefore. i will be evaluating alternative solutions to these problems with the purpose of offering the appropriate amendments to this bill as it progresses through the subcommittee and committee stages. by mr. jackson (for himself.
. on june 13 of this year. the medical community lost a valued and wdely hoed member. dr. george c. cotzias outstanding research in the control of parkinsons disease through the use of ldopa therapy has benefited thousands of victims of this neurologic disease. a citation to dr. cotzias by the harvey society in 1972 disease: one of the major therapeutic contribuions of this generation is the discovery that lihydroxyphenylaline (dopa) can reverse "ost nr all of te maicr manifestations of iarkinsons disease. dr. cotzias remarkable chievement came only after a lonz series of undamental investigations into the metabism of the brain. this sneilc and marked ffect of dopa has stimulated many other nvestigations to find potentially similar nswers to otner unsolved neurological disases. i ask unanimous consent to print in he record an obituary which appeared 1 the new york times about dr. otzias.
i would like to associate myself with the remarks of the senator from new jersey. i am the ranking member of this committee. it was a very. very difficult solution to work out. there was much feeling in the medical schools about it. we finally worked out a compromise which i believe is generally acceptable. except perhaps for those few medical schoolsand i do  denigrate them at allto which senator mathias has spoken. it represents a repeal. a change. a basic change. in existing law. i think it is a very clear promise which was made to 840 students that they could complete their educations in the united states. that is of inestimable value to us because it is a fact. and i state it as a fact. that the degree of training is higher and will equip them better to be doctors in this country if they do have this last year in our own medical schools. that is an ascertained fact. under all those circumstances. and with the greatest affection and respect for my friend from maryland. i hope the senate will reject this amendment.
. today i join with senator kennedy. chairman of the subcommittee on health and scientific research of the human resources committee. of which i am ranking miity member. in introducing the health planning amendments of 1978. a 3year renewal of the national health planning and resources development act of 1974public law 93641. i was a coauthor of that legislation which was signed into law 3 years ago and established through the nation a network of 205 health systems agencies to carry out health planning and resources development at the regional and local levels. this. combined with 56 state and territorial agencies. provides for a federal. state. and local network for planning and allocating increasingly scarce resources for the organization and delivery of personal medical care services. these health systems agencies. which are determining regional blueprints for the delivery of medical care. are governed by a board of consumers and providers livingin that region. so that local cxxiv23part 1 needs and local voices can determine the individual health priorities for each health service area. although this is a complex and intense process. i am pleased with the progress that we have seen to date under the law. within the next year all 205 health systems agencies will have health systems plans for their regions. so that we will have a clear idea of the health needs of our population. the amendments which i join my colleagues in introducing today are primarily to correct mi administrative and organizational inconsistencies in the original act. there are. however. a few significant changes which will be closely examined during the intensive hearing process which will begin on this legislation during the first week of february. among these are requirements that: first. refine the certificate of need process in the current legislation. including making certificate of need decisions consistent with the state health plan and broadening certificate of need requirements to include any equipment valued at more than $150.000 irrespective of location. second. establish a voluntary program to encourage hospitals to close. merge. or convert unnecessary facilities or services for which financial assistance would be made available. and third. authorize the gover of a state to approve the state health plan developed by the statewide health coordinating council. over which he  has authority. these. as well as the many other provisions. are outlined in detail in the accompanying summary of the legislation and sectionbysection analysis. in addition section 1625(d) of the health planning and resources development act provides for grants to public hospitals for construction and modernization projects designed to. first. eliminate or prevent imminent safety hazards. as defined by federal. state. or local fire. building. or life safety codes or regulations. or second. avoid compliance with state or voluntary licensure or accreditation standards. until last year funding for this section depended upon a 22 percent setaside of funds appropriated for all hospital construction under the act. unfortunately since the enactment of public law 93641 such funds have been appropriated. and the 22 percent setaside has been limited to about $11 million. which was the required share of carryover funds. last year during the human resources committees consideration of the health programs extenson act of 1977. it was brought to my attention that hew had received 136 applications for $138 million for reation and improvement projects to make hospitals safe. hews initial review showed that 50 applicants for $66 million met basic eligibility requirements. since that time the need for this assistance has become even more pressing. it was for this reason that i included a provision in the health programs extension act which was signed into law last year for a separate funding authority of $67.5 million for such projects. in the amendments being introduced today i have had included authorizations of $75 million for fiscal year 1979. $100 million for fiscal year 1980. and $125 million for fiscal year 1981. funding of this provision must be a top priority for the fiscal year 1979 appropriations process. public hospitals. which serve primarily the medically indigent of our nation. have too long been without even the basic assistance to meet the minimum life and safety codes required of all hospitals in the nation.  only are the medically indigent. particularly in the countrys urban areas. facing a shortage of resources from which to receive medical care. but when those who finally are able to obtain care receive it. it is in an institution to which you and i would be unwilling to send our own famlies. in this legislation. as well as in the public health service authorities which we will be renewing shortly. i plan to emphasize the need for a focus on our citizens living in the nations medically underserved urban areas. the public general hospitals in our innercity areas serve as the routine source of medical care for much of their community. which in many cases is primarily poor and medically indigent. frequently these facilities are the only source of care for persons covered by medicaid and for the working poor who are  eligible for such assistance. the need for medical care is so intense that public hospital emergency rooms and outpatient departments are deluged by people who have basic medical needs which do  require emergency room treatment. or hospitalization. but the needs are so great and the resources are so limited that the public hospital is the only identifiable medical resource in the community. one of the significant problems in this area is a lack of attention in the planning process to the immediate need to reform the organization and delivery of primary care and institutional health care services in the inner city. in addition to making good use of the resources that are provided for in section 1625(d) for the reation and modernization of public hospitals. hsas must move ahead immediately to target their efforts on innercity health problems. the developmental funds provided for hsas under section 1640 should be first targeted on initiatives to increase accessibility. availability. and quality of medical care for medically underserved areas. as the subcommittee proceeds with hearings and markup on this legislation. i intend to work for specific requirements in the law to meet these needs. i look forward to the input of those organizations representing the public hospitals. the community health centers. and the millions of medically underserved americans who reside in our inner cities and in other areas. by mr. deconcini:
. i am pleased to join with senator kennedy today in introducing the national institutes of health care research act of 1978. this bill. which establishes a new agency in the public health service. is designed to consolidate and give emphasis to the activities of the national center for health statistics and the national center for health services research and to establish a new national center for the evaluation of medical techogies. this new entity would be charged primarily with evaluating the cost and efficacy of new medical techogies. although the federal government invests heavily in basic and applied biomedical research. the federal effort has been clearly inadequate in the areas of the collection and analysis of national morbidity. mortality. and disability data. this. of course. impacts on our ability to evaluate biomedical research efforts. furthermore. i believe we have  placed egh emphasis on research into better methods of organizing and managing the delivery of health care services. therefore. i support the concept of consolidating the activities of the national center for health statistics and the national center for health services research into a new agency. although i anticipate that the proposed reorganization of the activities of the national center for health statistics and the national center for health services research will be keenly debated during the hearings on this legislation. i hope also that the recommendation for the establishment of a national center for the evaluation of medical techogies will get careful analysis by biomedical researchers and health practitioners. this proposal. as i envision it. is  to regulate the practice of medicine or limit the development of medical discoveries. it should  interfere with the food and drug administration mandate to insure the safety and effectiveness of drugs and devices. it should  interfere with clinical trials performed by the national institutes of health and the center for disease control. the new national center for the evaluation of medical techogies would. however. assure that medical professionalsand the publicare made aware of the efficacy and costeffectiveness of new medical techogies by periodic published reports. i have long believed that the best method of preventing abuses is by the availability of timely. informative. and reliable information for both practitioners and consumers. i recognize that we guard scrupulously against any agency having a potential to inhibit ination and research in the development of new medical techogy. this is  my intention. . i believe. the intention of this legislation. accordingly. during hearings on this proposal. i invite the research community and medical professionals to come forward with their analysis and evaluation of this measure in the light of these concerns. also. at the same time i look forward to receiving the views of the secretary of hew as to the advisability of his vesting his authority respecting techogy assessment in the proposed institutes of health care research. although the precise mechanism for accomplishing such goals may vary from this proposal. i think it is time that we assure both the physician and the consumer that the billions of additional dollars we spend each year are for medical care of the highest quality will result in an improved health status for the american people.
. i am pleased to join with my colleague senator kennedy in cosponsoring the health services extension act of 1978. basically. the bill provides for the extension of numerous programs authorized under the public health service act which would otherwise expire this year. in particular. the bill extends for 1 year existing programs dealing with hypertension. immunizations. rat control. disease control programs. venereal disease control. and leadbased paint poisoning prevention. these programs are being given 1year extensions so that the human resoures health subcommittee has more time to review them thoroughly in the context of a major prevention initiative which is currently being developed. it is my longheld conviction that more of our health resources should be directed to preventive. as opposed to curative. health services. accordingly. it is my intent and understanding that the prevention bill  being drafted will replace the 1year extension of preventionrelated programs in this bill. however. since the prevention bill is  yet ready. we are introducing the present bill in its current form so as to assure the continuation of these various programs. so vital to the public health. in addition. section 314(d) of the public health service actrelating to grants for comprehensive public health servicesis being extended for 1 year in order to give the subcommittee the opportunity to review the program and to receive testimony from state health officers. govers. and other interested parties regarding the most appropriate method for distributing funds under this program. this bill also contains a 1year extension of the national genetic diseases act. of which i am the author. continuing the authorization at the same level of $30 million. this authorization carries out the recommendation of the commission for the control of huntingtons disease. mandated by the congress in public law 9463. the national genetic diseases act. incorporated in public law 94278. establishes a national program of regional screening. testing. counseling. and information and education programs. primarily in conjunction with other existing health programs. i am currently in the process of reviewing the legislation and plan to introduce amendments to the program next week. these amendments will respond to bureaucratic problems in interpreting the law and will broaden and improve existing authorities. also included in the bill before you  are continuing authorities for community health centers. in conjunction with this section of the bill. i am proposing an urban initiative which is designed to meet some of the critical service delivery problems currently plaguing many urban. innercity areas. i have long been concerned about the adequacy of health care services in the major urban centers of our country. it is  estimated that there are 49.1 million people residing in areas of the united states which. for purposes of health services. have been classified as "underserved." this means that the area has a shortage of pesonal health services as determined by factors such as the following: the ratio of primary care physicians to population. relevant health indices and ecoic factors affecting access to services. of these 49 million people. almost half live in urban areas. in medically underserved areas. the poor are being forced to use hospital emergency rooms and outpatient departments for firstcontact or primary care services. this phee is attributable. in large part. to two factors: the unavailability of private physicians or the unwillingness of private physicians to care for these individuals. consequently. persons residing in these areas are being deprived of badly needed comprehensive and preventive medical care services.  only are the residents of such areas adversely affected. but hospital resources are severely strained in twc ways by the improper use of emergency room and outpatient department facilities: first. additional demands for staff and services are placed on the emergency rooms and outpatient departments. second. greater hospital deficits are incurred .ecause many individuals are unable to pay for the services they receive. for example. it has been estimated that in 18 private. profit hospitals in new york city between 1971 and 1973. the deficit resulting from the delivery of outpatient and emergency services reached $115 million. in an effort to begin addressing some of the peculiar health service delivery problems facing urban areas. i am including today as part of the health services extension act of 1978 a proposal which is designed to serve as a first step toward alleviating these problems. i am proposing a demonstration project which would provide grant funds to public general hospitals or private profit hospitals located in medically underserved urban areas for the pu:pose of establishing hospitalaffiliated primary care centers through the reform of emergency rooms and outpatient departments. public general hospitalp and some private profit hospitals located in innercity communities often serve as the routine source of medical care for much of the community. frequently these facilities are the only source of care for medicaid recipients and the working or near poor. my proposal. which amends section 330 of the public health service act (relating to community health centers). would fund at least 30 demonstration projects over 3 years. this would provide increased access to improved health care services for approximately 1 million people. in order to receive funds under the program. eligible institutions would submit applications to the secretary of hew containing assurances that: first. for purposes of construction. modernization and reation. existing facilities and equipmentparticularly in emergency rooms and outpatient departmentswould be utilized. second. the hospital will maintain appropriate emergency room and outpatient department services. third. the primary care center will be operated as a separate and distinct cost unit. fourth. the primary care center will deliver primary health care services through a group of health professionals composed of primary care physicians and allied health personnel. and fifth. the primary care center will provide for referral for emergency medical services and supplemental health services. in addition. i am currently exploring the possibility of requiring additional assurances which would provide for incentive reimbursement mechanisms and reorganization of primary care services within the hospital setting. the purpose of these additions would be to make this initiative more consistent with the cost containment and quality of care objectives already established by the health subcommittee. facilities intended for the receipt of these demonstration grants are primarily urban. innercity public general or private profit hospitals. i believe that this demonstration project can make two significant contributions to health care services in urban areas: first. because grant funds will cover the costs associated with the planning and operating of the primary care centers. these funds will provide muchneeded fiscal relief to the hospitals and will allow them better to perform the various distinct functions associated with emergency rooms. outpatient departments and primary care. second. for millions of people who currently have alternative. the establishment of these primary care centers will allow for the provision of comprehensive and preventive health services. continuity of care. and the development of a strong and lasting physician/patient relationship. in addition to the establishment of these demonstration primary care centers. i am also proposing an increased emphasis on the number of freestanding community health centers to be started in urban areas. to date. 302 of the 463 community health centers funded under the community health center program have been established in rural areas. while i recognize the need for targeting such centers toward rural areas. i believe that the needs of urban areas should  be overlooked. in innercity areas. 111 standard metropolitan statistical areas (smsas) have been identified as areas of high priority need for such centers. consequently. i intend to encourage the committee to adopt policies which will assure that urban areas receive an adequate share of the funds for new community health centers.
. at this point i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a telegram from the national council for international health supporting this legislation. i am very grateful for their input in developing this initiative. also. i ask unanimous consent that a summary and a sectionbysection analysis of the bill and the bill itself be printed in the record.
. i rise in support of s. 2416. the nurse training amendments of 1978. this bill. which i introduced on january 27. 1978. and which  has 26 cosponsors. is a straight 2year extension of existing nurse training authorities with only one revision. financial distress grants (section 815) have been deleted and the $5 million authorized there added to the special projects grants (section 820). as my colleagues are doubt aware. the administration has proposed in its fiscal year 1979 budget that substantial cuts be made in federal assistance for nurse training programs. in hearings before the human resources subcommittee on health and scientific research. witnesses representing the administration attempted to justify this position by arguing that the current supply of nurses is adequate to support the existing health care system. it is my belief and. by a unanimous vote. the belief of the human resources committee. that continuation of federal support for nursing education programs is vital at this time. i believe that a serious withdrawal of financial assistance in this area would lead to severe financial hardships for nursing schools and nursing students alike. according to a survey conducted by the american association of colleges for nursing. 48 percent of the schools surveyed indicated that curtailment or loss of federal funding would necessitate elimination of a program. in addition. roughly threequarters of the schools surveyed indicated that a reduction in federal funding on the order proposed by the administration would necessitate a significant lowering of enrollment in one or more of the baccalaureate or higher degree programs. the impact of reduced federal support for nursing education on nursing students is likely to have an equally dramatic adverse impact. according to representatives from the national student nurses association. the costs of tuition. books. supplies. uniforms. and transportation to and from settings where clinical experience is gained have risen sharply in recent years like the costs associated with all other aspects of the medical care delivery system. because of the rigorous schedule imposed by required time for clinical experience coupled with classroom instruction and study time. most nursing students have fewer opportunities to earn the needed funds since their schedules leave less time for outside employment. the preliminary returns of a survey conducted by the national student nurses association revealed that a majority of respondents receive federal financial assistance for their nursing education. and that approximately half of the respondents come from families with incomes below $15.000 per year. in addition to the hardships that cuts in funding will produce for schools and students. i am  convinced that the existing supply of nurses is adequate to support the medical care system either  or in the future. during hearings on s. 2416. the subcommittee on health and scientific research heard from witnesses representing the american hospital association regarding the difficulties many hospitals are having in numerous parts of the country in recruiting adequately trained nurses. in addition. given the renewed emphasis on establishing additional health care facilities in local communities through such programs as community health centers. migrant health centers. health maintenance organizations. and other health service delivery entities. and given the potential for national health insurance. i believe that the demand for nurses is likely to increase and  decrease. for these reasons i feel it is imperative to continue support for nurse training programs at their current authorization levels. i recognize. however. that a complete reevaluation of the programs supported by the nurse training act is in order. to that end. it is my understanding that both the department of health. education. and welfare and the nursing profession are conducting studies aimed at ascertaining the future needs of the nursing profession. i believe that in 2 years. when s. 2416 expires i look forward to receiving the results of these studies and to developing proposals for the reform of the nurse training act. in the meantime. however. because of the potential adverse consequences which nursing schools and students are likely to suffer and because of the uncertain future demand for nurses. i believe we should continue our support of nursing education programs at this time. i urge my colleagues to favorably support s. 2416.0
. my relationship to the pending measure. s. 2579. goes back to the 92d congress. at that time i introduced legislation to respond to the moral. legal. and ethical dilemmas posed by the rapid advances of modern science and medical techogy. the pending bill is an historic milestone in my legislative efforts to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. as the author of the provision in s. 2579 which authorizes the national commission for the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research to conduct a study on the ethical. social. and legal implications of voluntary testing. counseling. and information and education programs with respect to genetic diseases. i am concerned that those who raise the specter of abortion fail to recognize that genetic counseling is the newest breakthrough in preventive medicine and integral to reducing the risk of genetic disease. the intention and purpose of such study is to recognize the tragic statistics of genetic disease in the united states. to wit: one hundred thousand miscarriages each year are caused by gross genetic defects. forty percent of infant mortality results from genetic factors. onethird of pediatric ward patients are there for genetic reasons. and the need for a responsible and thoughtful body to provide us with information regarding the moral. legal. and ethical issues related thereto. i believe congress has a responsibility to assure meaningful legal controls of research involving human subjects. and in fact authored the informed patient consent amendment to the food. drug and cosmetic act to achieve that end. at the same time we must understand that when we consider biomedical research it is imperative that we maintain a constant vigil lest the zeal which first motivated and then impelled man forward in his neverending quest for enlightenment be like the sorcerers apprentice. exceeding its bounds and unfettered cause us to outdistance our own capacity for commonsense and decency. thus. the provision i authored would provide the congress with the necessary information respecting the moral. legal. and ethical implications of genetic counseling to allow us to legislate in the future with kledge and  in a practical. ethical. or legal vacuum. my deep personal concern about this subject caused me in 1973 to sponsor with the human resources committee chairman senator williams. the ranking miity member of the health subcommittee. senator schweiker. and the chairman of the health subcommiittee. senator kennedy. a special congressional briefing session about the advances in biomedical science as it relates to genetic issues and their important consequences for the future of mankind generally and for our country in particular. new developments have profound ethical and legislative implications. and so require understanding on our part as legislators if they are to be used for maximum benefit to our people. if we are to overcome igance respecting genetic disease we must assure that our scientific inquiry is constantly blended with judgment. compassion. and sympathy. the true synthesis of humaneness and humanity. that is the true purpose of the provision in the bill requiring the commission to study the moral. ethical. and legal issues respecting genetics. thus. while i see necessity for the amendment proposed. to the effect that such study shall evidence concern for the essential equality of all human beings. born and unborn. i. at the same time see need to oppose the amendment. the amendment i believe. reflects that authors personal concerns regarding the unborn. in my view that would in any event be a factor in the commissions consideration.*
. i support s. 2534. the health maintenance organization amendments of 1978. of which i am a cosponsor. as a longtime proponent of the prepaid health care concept. and having played an active role in the fashioning of the original health maintenance organization act. public law 93222. i remain strongly committed to continued federal support for the development of health maintenance organizations. in my judgment. the hmo concept embodies many of the very goals which health policymakers in both the public and private sectors are currently seeking to achieve. hmos stress prevention and early detection. hmos employ a reimbursement scheme which discourages unnecessary hospitalizations. unnecessary lab tests. the purchase and construction of unnecessary equipment and facilities. and utilize other practices which lead to greater demonstrated cost efficiency. furthermore. hmos inject in the health care system a muchneeded element of competitionthat is. an alternative to the feeforservice system which  dominates health care. taken together. these characteristics build a solid foundation for health care services delivery reform. the need for such reform is paramount and undeniable. consequently i believe that continued federal support of the hmo program is warranted and justified. i recognize that implementation of the hmo act has  been without its problems. during the years immediately following passage of the act. hew. for example. was inexcusably slow in issuing regulations. more recently the department has allowed applications for hmo qualification to accumulate. causing undesirable backlogs in the qualification process. in addition. many hmos have experienced serious difficulties in becoming financially viable entities. despite these shortterm problems. however. i am convinced that hmos hold great promise for the provision of reasonably priced. accessible health care services. in the recent years of federal experience with hmos. legislative improvements have been identified which. if enacted. would better stimulate the growth and development of hmos. the amendments before us today by and large represent the human resources committees efforts to modify and thus strengthen the provisions of the hmo act in order to achieve this objective. i believe that the committee bill as amended by the proposal to be offered by senator nunn. of which i am a cosponsor. is an excellent compromise which will strengthen the hmo program. i urge my colleagues to support favorably both the nunn amendment and the amended committee bill.o
. i support s. 2410. the health planning amendments of 1978. this bill. unanimously reported by the human resources committee. revises and extends the national health planning and resources development act which i coauthored in 1974 (public law 93641). the purpose of the original act was to establish a system which would rationally plan the use of. and allocate. increasing scarce health resources. public law 93641 established a nationwide network of 205 health systems agencies and 56 state and territorial agencies to carry out health planning and resources development activities. these agencies are developing regional blueprints for the delivery of medical care. the hsas are governed by boards of consumers and providers living in their respective regions so that local needs and local voices can determine the individual health priorities for each health service area. although implementation of this program has  been without its problems. i am generally pleased with the progress we have experienced thus far. within the next year all 205 health systems agencies will have health systems plans for their regions. thereby revealing a clear picture of the health needs of our citizens. the amendments we are considering today represent the first major revision of public law 93641 since its enactment. in developing the legislation. the committee made a concerted effort to seek the views and recommendations of all interested parties. during consideration of this measure. hundreds of groups and individuals were consulted through hearings. individual meetings. and corresponidence. virtually every recommendation was carefully analyzed. and the bill we have before us today represents the product of that effort. i believe that each of these amendments will serve to strengthen the health planning process. to accomplish this objective. the bill includes important provisions designed to assure effective participation by the consumers who sit on the hsa governing boards. to strengthen the role of the gover in the oyerall planning process. to require that\ certificateofneed decisions be consistent with the state health plan. to specify the criteria to be used in making certificateofneed decisions and in determining the appropriateness of existing services. to assure representation of medically underserved populations on the various planning agencies. and to improve the coordination between health planning entities and appropriate drug abuse. alcohol abuse. and mental health agencies. the bill also contains provisions to revise and extend the health resources development authority under title xvi of the public health service act. one important provision contained in this section establishes a program to assist and encourage the voluntary discontinuance of unneeded hospital services. existing lawsection 1625(d). provides for grants to public hospitals for construction and modernization projects designed to. first. eliminate or prevent imminent safety hazards. as defined by federal. state. or local fire. building. or life safety codes or regulations. or. second. avoid compliance with state or voluntary licensure or accreditation standards. the financial problems of local government make it difficult to raise capital for needed reconstruction or reation of the public general hospitals. tax revenues often can meet their needs. and localities often must borrow at extremely high interest rates. in some cases. localities are excluded from the bond market altogether. often the physical plant is old and reated only with extreme difficulty. yet reation is necessary if the hospital is to meet required life safety codes. one such facility that typifies these special problems is the harlem hospital center in new york city. whose approved application for assistance under this section is pending the appropriation of additional funds. until last year. funding for this section depended upon a 22percent setaside of funds appropriated for all hospital construction under the act. unfortunately. since the enactment of public law 93641. such funds have been appropriated. and the 22 percent setaside has been limited to about $11 million. which was the required share of carryover funds. last year during the human resources committees consideration of the health programs extension act of 1977. it was brought to my attention that hew had received 136 applications for $138 million for reation and improvement projects to make hospitals safe. presently there are 53 urban and rural project grants which have been approved for funding at a total of $200 million. it was for this reason that i offered a provision in the health programs extension act which was signed into law last year for a separate funding authority of $67.5 million for such projects. in the bill before us today. there are included authorizations totaling $300 million over 3 years. these funds are to be used to help the public general hospitals meet and maintain minimum life safety code standards and other licensure requirements. i believe it is incumbent upon the congress to assure that the care rendered by these public facilities is delivered in a safe environment. finally. i would like to comment on the amendments which will be offered today. while i support the amendments which are being offered by the committee. i am opposed to the amendment to be offered by senators hatch and
. while the joint committee may  solve all the problems associated with divided jurisdiction. i believe that the joint committee could serve as an effective mechanism for facilitating congressional consideration of national health insurance legislation and would serve to encourage strong congressional leadership in the development of a coordinated national health insurance policy. i urge my colleagues to act favorably on this legislation.*
. i feel deeply about the venereal disease section. back on may 19. senator schweiker. senator crafee. and i asked for a hearing of the health subcommittee on the proposed immunization program- i am the ranking miity member of the full committee. and senator schweiker is the ranking miity member of the subcommitteein order to see whether we should go forward with it. i feel that if anything like this flu program is to be undertaken. it certainly should be with separate authorizing authority.  just raiding venereal disease. where a serious epidemic is raging.
madam president madam president. this is one of the most gifted ideas we ever had. a basket of experimental educational projects. these are limited and circumscribed in terms of appropriations. with full freedom of action to the appropriations committee. if seasoned and proved right. which is something we rarely do in government. then they could become per.manent programs or. if . be dropped. it is exactly what those who preach ecoy want in a governmental program. madam president. it has been creatively participated in by senator kennedy. who is responsible for the lawrelated education section. by myself and senator kennedy in respect of preparing lowincome students for medical school. by senator pell on corrections education. and by those of my colleagues on the miity. senator stafford for population education and senator chafee for health education
