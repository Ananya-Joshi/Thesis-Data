the senator makes a point that i would like to emphasize. and that is that it endangers others than those to whom the act may be pointed. when they begin to send packages containing booby traps through the mail. any mail handler. any inent person picking up the package. that might  even be addressed to him. is in danger of death. and when they begin to engage in the indiscriminate shooting of israeli diplomats. and anyone could get hit. how can any nation in the world tolerate that conduct. it is almost inconceivable in the modern world. but it is so. i am glad the senator agrees that. where action is taken by the united nations on a matter so much within its concept. we should encourage it. . i suggest the absence of a quorum.
