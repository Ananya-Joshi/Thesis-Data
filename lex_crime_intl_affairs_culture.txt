. it is a fact that the jewish community of some 3 million souls in the soviet union has been completely cut off from the rest of the jewish people of the world. denied contact with them. denied the right to participate in international jewish conferences. in global jewish relief effort. and even refused the elementary right of obtaining books and periodicals of jewish interest published in other countries. this is despite a longstanding and longforgotten statute against antisemitism providing for prison terms up to 2 years. despite widely touted assertions that this bias does  exist in the u. s. s. r.. because it is a tool of the "imperialist bourgeoisie in order to create national hatred" and despite claims that the 42 percent of the soviets population who are russian enjoy equal freedoms. the new york herald tribune has ed editorially the sixth anniversary of the execution of jewish intellectuals by the soviet communists under josef stalin. this anniversary had been brought to mind by a letter to that paper written by a former colleague in the house of representatives. mrs. helen gahagan douglas. mrs. douglas ed that these executions were the culmination of a campaign of cultural geide begun by stalin in 1948 with the closing of all jewish cultural institutions. i ask unanimous consent that the letter to the editor by mrs. douglas and the editorial from the new york herald tribune be printed at this point in the record as a part of my remarks.
