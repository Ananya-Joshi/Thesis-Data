it is a matter of particular concern to me that the congress has  yet enacted legislation to guarantee to the public the right to k the financial interests of those who guide their government. i strongly believe that the public has that right and that the disclosure of financial worth by policymakers is one step toward strengthening the public trust in government. obviously. we consider this matter of the financial interests of public officials to be of importance. otherwise we would  be spending the time spent already in making such inquiries of a potential vice president of the united states. there is  one single confirmation hearing that we conduct in the senate that does  have as a key part of the hearing a statement of assets and liabilities and the elimination of any assets and liabilities which we demand. where any conflict of interest might arise. during floor consideration of the federal election campaign act. i supported and the senate passed an amendment that would have required public reporting by elected federal officials of persolal financial affairs. this amendment would have covered each candidate for election to congress. members of congress. the president. the vice president and certain u.s. officers and employees. at gs16 level or earning more than $25.000 per year. reports of financial interests would have been filed with the federal election commission and would have included: first. amounts of federal. state. and local income or property taxes paid. i second. amount and source of each item of income or gift over $100. third. identity of assets and liabilities over $1.000. fourth. all dealing in securities and commodities over $1.000. and fifth. all purchases or sales of interest in real property involing over $1.000. except for personal residence. however. this amendment. passed in the senate by voice vote. was deleted afterwards during conference consideration of the federal election campaign act. the federal election campaign act. as passed into law. contained provision for financial -disclosurepublic financial disclosureby elected and appointed federal officials. the amendment that i am proposing today is simple and straightforward. it is  as comprehensive as the previous disclosure amendment that was deleted in conferencebut seeks to establish in law minimal disclosure requirements for elected federal officials. those covered by the act would be the president. the vice president. members of the senate. members of the house of representatives. and all employees of the executive and legislative branches receiving compensation at an annual rate of more than $30.000. what and when do they have to file. annually with the comptroller general a list of all assets and liabilities over $1.500. on the basis of fair market value as of december 31 of the previous year. all reports filed with the comptroller general are to be maintained by the comptroller general as public records. open to inspection by members of the public. the act would become effective as of january 1975. the time period covered would be the preceding calendar year. therefore. by february 15 of 1975. all persons covered by this legislation would have to indicate what their net worth was as of december 31. 1974. anyone who had been appointed or elected in a public election during the course of 1975 would have to file such a statement within 45 days of his election or appointment. i recognize that the bill we are dealing with concerns privacy. a need for which. as i have already indicated. has always been of deep concern to the distinguished senator from th carolina. indeed. the distinguished senator from illis has also been a leader in assuring this most basic right. i predict right  that the question of the right to privacy will be one of the great issues of the 1970s and 1980s. it goes to the very basis of the constitution which the senator from th carolina has so ably defended over the years. i think it is important to point out on every occasion that we can that the difference between our political system and that of any other nation in todays world. or indeed throughout history. is that our constitution and our political system focus on the individual.  on society as a whole on the mass. but on the individual. Â• if we want something that is efficient. trouble free. and expeditious. it can be the constitution of the united states. how can we have something that is quiet. efficient. and trouble free when it concerns itself with 210 million people. it is impossible. that is why the issue of privacy is importantso that we preserve that spirit which has guaranteed to each human being in this country a full flowering of their abilities and their aspirations and their hopes. that opportunity for individual flowering has given us a magnificent historical experience. so this is  an academic issue. to be debated by scholars and professors. but indeed it goes to the very heart of our experience as a nation. . . that my colleagues would see fit to impose this obligation on themselves. and i think it would do a great deal to bring us up the ladder of respect in the eyes of the american people. i might add that i believe most of the individuals whom i see in this chamber have done that anyway. i am  pointing any finger. but i would just like to see us go ahead and make it a matter of law rather than a matter of individual discretion.
