i applaud my colleagues on the commerce committee. particularly the distinguished chairman senator mccain. the ranking member senator hollings. and senators se and breaux for their hard work on these provisions. although the subtitle regarding the dingelljohnson/ wallopbreaux program is included in the amendment offered on behalf of the commerce committee. i would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on that committee for the opportunity to remain involved in the negotiations leading to the language in the subtitle. and for the recognition that jurisdiction for that subtitle remains within both committees. indeed. the federal aid in sport fish restoration program. taken in its entirety. is primarily under the jurisdiction of the environment and public works committee.
