i am pleased to see in the senate version of h.r. 5313 and. therefore. in this bill. a major new initiative in the area of the global environment. specifically the problems of stratospheric ozone depletion. the greenhouse effect and climate change that is caused. in part. by manmade pollution. the bills include a comprehensive. three agency effort to fully understand the threat of global environmental change and to decide what should be done about it. in addition to funds for nasa and the national science foundation. the committee has added $7.6 million to the environmental protection agencys budget to support the upcoming international negotiations on chlorofluorocarbon controls. analyze and evaluate control techogies. develop chemical alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons. evaluate the effects of ozone depletion on human health. determine the potential environmental and ecoic impact of climate change. and analyze policies to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. . on september 12. 1986. senators stafford. durenberger. humphrey. mitchell. gore. baucus. one of the distinguished floor managers. senator leahy. and i wrote to lee thomas. the administrator of the epa. to request that he undertake two studies on climate change due to the greenhouse effect and submit them to congress later than march 31. one of the studies is to examine the health and environmental effects of climate change including. but  limited to. the potential impacts on agriculture. forests. wetlands. human health. rivers. lakes and estuaries as well as other ecosystems and societal impacts. the other study is to include an examination of the policy options that. if implemented. would stabilize current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. the policy options are to include a specific plan for what the united states can do to stabilize or reduce its share of greenhouse gas emissions as well as a plan for helping other nations to achieve comparable levels of controls. as set forth in the senate report accompanying h.r. 5313 and. by reference. this bill. epa is directed to use the funds appropriated by this bill to conduct a number of studies concerning the global environment. are the studies requested in our letter of september 12. 1986. as i have just described them. included in that directive.
i thank the senators for their assistance. this is a modest initiative. it is a small step in an attempt to come to grips with what. at times. appears to be an overwhelming problem. educating our educators and children about the greenhouse effect before it becomes an unmanageable crisis may be the key to preventing it from becoming a global environmental crisis. we can affort to wait until we are certain of all the details. in addition to continuing to search for more information. we must begin to share the information that we already have.
. on june 10 and 11 of this year the subcommittee on environmental pollution held hearings on the. issues of ozone depletion. the greenhouse effect and climate change. we heard from. a distinguished panel of scientists who delivered their message with remarkable clarity and unanimity. . their message. and the conclusion i have come to after reviewing other sources. is this: the continued use of chlorofluorocarbons [cfcs] is likely to lead to depletion of the earths protective stratospheric ozone layer. the effects of this depletion will strike at the very core of everyones health and environmental wellbeing. i do  mean just the health of all americans. i mean the health of everyone on this earth. increased skin cancers. suppression of the immune response system and loss of aquatic species are just some of the dangers that lie ahead if we fail to act. in the few months since those hearings. the news from the scientific community has only added to my concern. more sophisticated computer models of our atmosphere show that future depletion at latitudes that include the thern united states and much of europe. in addition. preliminary data from a nasa satellite shows that a hole may also be occurring over the arctic during the spring seasonsimilar to but smaller than the one kn to exist over the antarcticand a small but significant reduction in global stratospheric ozone levels may have occurred during the past several years. while we recognize that many scientific uncertainties remain. we must also recognize our responsibility to act in a prudent manner to safeguard the wellbeing of our planet and its inhabitants. . in has  been. over 12 years since the first warning about the dangers of cfcs and ozone depletion. a considerable body of scientific evidence has reinforced that warning. do we continue to expand our reliance on cfcs while we wait for even more evidence. further placing in jeopardy the very future of our planet. or do we act  to safeguard the ozone layer for our and future generations. given the magnitude of the health and environmental risks involved. a plan that leads to the eventual elimination of ozonedepleting chemicals from global commerce is the only acceptable solution. limited growth or maintenance of current levels of use are unacceptable. efforts to preserve our ozone layer transcend narrow interests. it does  apply just to certain. sections of the united states or indeed to the united states. it applies to the whole world. we must all accept responsibility for preserving our earths basic life support systems. . where do we as americans find cfcs. well. we used to find them in aerosol cans but the cfcs have been taken out of them. where we find cfcs  is in refrigeration units. whether it be in our refrigerators or air conditioners in our automobiles. homes. business firms and factories. we also find them being used as solvents to clean computer chips and as a foam blowing agent. even those fancy new egg cartons and macdonald hamburger containers are made with cfcs. - what actions are being taken to limit the global use of ozonedepleting cfcs. substantial progress has recently occurred within the united states and abroad. for example. in late july 1986. the senate ratified the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer. this framework treaty provides a basis for negotiations of specific measures to limit cfc emissions. recent statements by the trade group representing producers and users of cfcs suggest that they are increasingly aware of the risks from continued use of these chemicals and are willing to accept some form and level of limits. environmental groups and the public have also grown more aware of these risks and more vocal in their call for action. because of the global nature of this problem. any final solution will require the involvement of all nations. this is  a u.s. problem. this is  a western europe problem. this is  an industrial nation problem. it is a global problem. negotiations begin on december 1 of this year under the auspices of the united nations environment program. thank goodness we have this part of the united nations. the united states must continue its strong leadership role in pressing for a strong protocol which leads to the eventual phaseout of fully halogenated cfcs. my preference. of course. is for the nations of the world to reach such an agreement at the diplomatic conference scheduled for april 1987. nevertheless. if it appears that this round of negotiations is  likely to produce a strong protocol phasingout fully halogenated cfcs. as members of congress. it is my firm conviction. we would have to reassert our role as national decisionmakers and move legislation foward to require unilateral actionthat is solely on the part of the united statesleading to the phaseout of such cfcs. i recognize that unilateral action has both advantages and disadvantages. it would provide an early incentive for our domestic industry to begin work on producing alternative chemicals which would  adversely affect the ozone layer and could be used to replace cfcs. in other words. by passing legislation in the united states. we would get the jump on other nations. which i am convinced are going to have to take action. it is my understanding that such chemical substitutes are possible. but would take approximately 5 years to develop and would cost consumers a few pennies more. this seems like a small price to pay for protecting the important stratospheric ozone layer. by moving toward the development of these safer chemicals . our industry would get the jump on its competition abroad. to protect our environment and our domestic industry in the near term. i would also propose to include in legislation a provision which some call trade barriers. to me. a prohibition on the importation of products that are made with or contain material that could  be used in this country is  a trade barrier. it is a legitimate means of protecting our environment. so. if we move to ban cfcs. we have a perfect right in my judgment to ban the importation of products that have cfcs in them. for example. lets consider a japanese automobile with an air conditioner that contains and relies upon a particular form of chlorofluorocarbons. if we ban the use of such cfcs in our automobiles here. clearly we can ban them from importation. this is  a trade barrier. it is a legitimate means of protecting our environment. indeed the environment of the world. call it what one will. countries that wish to trade with us will have to abide by our rules for protecting our environment. i as an individual and as chairman of the environmental pollution subcommittee will closely follow the progress of the upcoming unep negotiations and will postpone proposing legislation calling for a phaseout of fully halogenated cfcs in products made in or imported into this country. however. if it appears that these negotiations are  likely to produce a strong protocol which leads to the elimination of such cfcs from global commerce. i intend to press for legislation. present the legislation. move it forward in the subcommittee. move it out of the full committee. and move it through this senatelegislation banning or strictly limiting cfcs in a timeframe that permits the development of substitutes. i will do that following the return of congress in january.

our letter delivered the same message as prime minister brundtland and urged the president. to call for an international treaty on global climate change. although i would have preferred to see our country take the lead on this matter. i am pleased to see that at least two of the worlds leaders agree with our proposal and are willing to speak out. what prompted this. it is the realization that human activity is altering our atmosphere and destroying the delicate balance that controls the earths climate. we are polluting our air with industrial and agricultural gases. we are releasing record amounts of carbon dioxide by destroying tropical forests and burning more and more coal and oil. the result is a phee kn as the greenhouse effect. the suns heat comes in. but is unable to escape from the atmosphere. it is trapped. these gases trap the suns heat like the glass in a greenhouse and cause temperatures to rise. for loo long. people have been discounting the importance of this issue by saying "the greenhouse effect is just a theory. there is too much we do  k. it would be premature to put controls in place." finally. that is starting to change. it must change. we can afford to sit by and wait for the problem to solve itself. scientists predict that the greenhouse effect will increase average global temperatures by 3 to 9 degrees parenheit in 40 to 60 years. this is the average. at the higher latitudes the increase will be even greater. reaching as much as 20 degrees. to put this in perspective. keep in mind that the global temperature has  risen by 3 degrees for more than 10.000 years. we - ialking about much larger changes in ktm than 60 years. the disruption and the devastation that will be caused by such a drastic. rapid change is mind boggling. last week. dr. jim hansen. one of the worlds foremost authorities on climate told us that four of the hottest years on record occurred in the 1980s and that. based on the first 5 months of 1988. this year will be the warmest yet. the odds of this being the result of natural variation is. according to dr. hansen. i in 100. he is 99 percent certain that the rising temperature trend is a result of the greenhouse j4une 29. 1988 .tne 29. 1988 effect. we are longer just talking about a theory. the greenhouse effect is here and global warming has begun. what happens with the heat. well. the antarctic ice melts. in the antarctic and arctic regions. glaciers melt. the heat and the drought that many parts of our country and the world are experiencing may be harbingers of things to come. rising sea levels caused by thermal expansion of the oceans and melting ice are aher greenhouserelated problem. to those who say it is premature to consider a global treaty that is aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and protecting the earths climate. i would point out that we will never get there if we do  get started. the international process moves slowly egh as it is. we can afford to delay any longer. the time for action is . i do hope that. in the balance of days. waning days of this adminlstration. that those in authority will recognize this more and more as we proceed. this is a tremendous threat to our globe and who is going to do something about it. well. the united states has to take the lead. we have to take the lead because. first of all. we are causing more of the heat rise than anybody. any other nation. with the consumption and burning of gasoline. oil. and coal. second. we have been traditionally leaders in environmental affairs. i hope we will keep that reputation. i thank the chair. exinsit 1 (from the boston globe. june 28. 19881 woolo lraoxlsr call pon daastic action to
. today the senate is considering the ination of samuel k. skinner to be secretary of the department of transportation. mr. skinner has a tough job ahead of him. but it will also be an exciting and rewarding one as he meets the challenges that will face the secretary of transportation. the environment and public works committee held an informational hearing with mr. skinner on january 26. recognizing the senate commerce. science. and transportations responsibility for reporting mr. skinners ination. the environment and public works committee has jurisdiction over the federalaid highway program and this is the largest single program within the department of transportation. therefore. the committee has a great deal of interest in mr. skinners views. his philosophy of management. and how decisions should be made. during our hearing. i was pleased to hear mr. skinners pledge consult with congress very closely when decisions are made. i believe he will include us in his decisionmaking process. and he will have to make some important decisions very soon. mr. skinner spoke of his commitment and sensitivity to environmental issues during his responses to questions asked at the committees hearing. i was encouraged by that. as secretary of transportation. he will soon have an opportunity to test his commitment to the environment. the secretary will have to decide shortly whether the corporate average fuel ecoy [cafe] standards should be relaxed for model year 1990. last year secretary burnley made the decision to ielax the cafe standards for model year 1989. this was done at a time when the evidence available suggested that standards should be tightened in order to control the problem of global climate changes that occur because of the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide from motor vehicles.  secretary skinner will be faced with a similar choice. and. if he is serious about environmental protection. he will reject the petition to relax cafe standards. the greenhouse issue is a serious one and i hope the new secretary of transportation will be a part of the solution we are seeking to this problem. we must use every means available to us to reduce harmful global climate changes. and the cafe standards play a very important role in that effort. after listening to mr. skinners testimony before the environment and public works committee. i am confident that he recognizes what a serious decision this is. and that lie will consult with us before he makes it. i believe mr. skinners education and experience will serve him well as secretary of transportation and i look forward to working with him as he develops a national transportation plan for our nation.
. numerous committees on both sides of the capitol have held hearing after hearing on the problems of global climate change and similar hearings on the destruction of the ozone layer. in the  too distant future it is my hope that the senate will have the opportunity to actually do something about these problems. the vehicle to do this would be legislation that has been labeled the stratospheric ozone and climate protection act of 1989. perhaps it is  possible that this legislation will survive in connection with this reconciliation measure. if that is so. so be it. it may be that a general effort to strip legislation that is  directly connected with reducing the deficit from the budget will succeed. i will  argue with that effort. but i certainly do hope that we are able to bring this legislation before the senate before the conclusion of this year.  what am i talking about. i am talking about an issue that i believe is extremely important for everybody in the united states to understand. this legislation. the stratospheric ozone and climate protection act. does the following: it focuses on the control of chlorofluorocarbons. kn as cfcs. these are manmade chemicals that have been identified as being responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. cfcs are persistent. extremely stable chemicals that rise up from 6 to 20 miles. reaching the stratosphere. in the stratosphere. the suns ultraviolet radiation breaks the molecule apart and frees the chlorine component. the chlorine component. then. attacks and destroys the ozone layer that is there. what is this ozone layer. why do we spend so much time worrying about it. the ozone layer is the earths main shield against ultraviolet radiation. a decrease in the stratospheric ozone. this layer. allows more of this radiation to come through onto the earth. the experts tell us that the abundance of this. the excess that comes through. that is mally prevented by the ozone layer. but will come through as the ozone layer is destroyed. increases the rates of skin disease. skin cancer rates in humans. it increases cataracts. it potentially destroys the immune suppression system that all of us have in our bodies. and it makes us susceptible to all types of diseases. that is the effect on humans: on the cataracts. on the suppressive system. on skin cancer. but that is  all. it also presents a serious threat to our food crops and to all forms of life on land and in the seas. most of us are familiar with this connection. that cfcs destroy the ozone layer. but there is aher destructive element to cfcs and that is in connection with the global climate change that is predicted to occur as a result of an intensified greenhouse effect. what is the greenhouse effect. the threat of uncontrolled global climate change is caused by the accelerating accumulation of certain gases in the atmosphere and these gases are carbon dioxide. they are chlorofluorocarbons. and they are methane. these gases. when they get into the atmosphere. act as a thermal blanket around the earth and they trap within the earths atmosphere the heat that is there. in other words. the sun pours heat down on the earth and the earth reflects it up and it dissipates and thus keeps the globe at a relatively mal. constant temperature. when this blanket is wrapped around the earth that prevents the heat from escaping. then we have what is kn as the greenhouse effect. obviously. if the heat can get in but it can get out. the earth warms up. what are these gases. carbon dioxide is the worst offender. that is estimated to cause about 50 percent of the global warming. cfcs are estimated to account for 15 to 20 percent of this warming. but. each molecule of cfc has approximately 20.000 tmes more impact on global climate than does a single molecule of carbon dioxide. one might say. if that is true. then. how come carbon dioxide is responsible for 50 percent of the global warming. that comes about because there are many more molecules of carbon dioxide released than there are of cfcs. furthermore. we can see that just a slight increase of the cfcs does tremendous destructive damage and causes the greenhouse effect. on the other hand. if we can reduce the cfcs. just keep working on pulling them down. then each step in that direction is extraordinarily important in our efforts to overcome the greenhouse effect. why are we worried about the greenhouse effect. what does it mean to our world. the statistics are extraordinarily interesting and alarming. an increase. with this global warming effect. in the global average temperature of 2.7 to 9.9 degrees fahrenheit over the next 40 to 60 years is anticipated. let me say that again. roughly an increase from 3 degrees to 10 degreees fahrenheit over the next 40 to 60 years is estimated to occur. will occur. due to these gases. these greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere. what does an increase of 3 to 10 degrees fahrenheit mean. let us compare it to what has happened in the history of the globe. in the past 10.000 years the temperature has only increased by 3 degrees in 10.000 years. we foresee that the temperature will increase by 3 to 10 degrees in the ..ext 40 to 60 years. this means nature just can adjust to this. this rapidly. it is impossible to do so. the extinction of numerous species of plants and animals and a significant interference with natures evolutionary responses will occur. reduced soil moisture content and altered storm patterns will seriously disrupt the agriculture of our nation and the agriculture of every nation in the world. a rise in sea level of 1 to 4 feet over the next 60 years will occur. and a continuing sea level rise in the succeeding years. it is easy to overstate the uncertainty that surrounds this issue. a lot of peoplewill say: prove it. it is true that scientists disagree on these matters. they disagree whether the greenhouse effect has actually started. there is scientific consensus about the precise timing of these changes. they can argue whether it is 3 degrees or 10 degrees or 7 degrees. they can argue whether it is going to happen in 40 years or 50 years or 60 years. nevertheless. there is a remarkable degree of scientific consensus concerning the massive threat that is posed by uncontrolled global climate change. specifically. most experts agree if we do  change our pattern of polluting the atmosphere. many of us. our children and our grandchildren. will experience devastating climate changes of a magnitude and at a rate that will preclude natural evolutionary responses. in other words. nature will just  be able to respond quickly egh. there is consensus on aher point. by the time there is scientific proof for every detail of this problem. when we can get all the scientists to agree. and that is going to take quite a while &nd will be a massive undertakingwhen they do agree it will be too late. it will be too late to avoid the most devastating impacts of an intensified greenhouse effect and of the global climate changes. so we just can wait aher 10 years and have more research to decide to do something. we must move immediately to reduce the atmospheric concentration of these greenhouse gases that i mentioned: carbon dioxide. cfcs. methane. at the same time we must implement additional strategies for coping withthe changes that have already taken place or will take place. i get back to cfcs. cfcs. as i say. are the cause of the destruction of the ozone layer. they contribute 15 to 20 percent of the greenhouse effect. so. if there is one gas that we ought to attack immediately. that is it. that does  mean we should  try to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions or the methane emissions. but by reducing the cfcs we get a double effect. we solve the ozone layer problem and we reduce the greenhouse gases. under the leadership of the u.n. environment program called unep. we have made an excellent start in connection with cfcs reduction. in september 1987 the montreal protocol on substancs that deplete the ozone layer was negotiated and it was signed by more than two dozen nations. it was a remarkable achievement. the protocol entered into force in january of this year. and more than 30 nations are  parties to the protocol. unfortunately. since this was negotiated in 1987. scientists have observed and measured losses of ozone on a global scale. in other words. we knew then what was happening over the antarctic. but  we have been seeing it all over the world. it hrs been discovered that destruction of the ozone layer is  limited to these remote sections of the antarctic that we are familiar with. equally alarming are reports from the antarctica. reports showing this years hole in the ozone layer  covers 10 million square miles. the expectation is that the severity of ozone loss over the antarctic this year will match the disaster of 1987. in other words. this is a cumulative process. it is getting worse and worse. in 1987. measurements revealed losses greater than 50 percent of the total ozone column and greater than 95 percent between the altitude of 15 to 20 kilometers. that is in the 9 to 12 miles up from the earth.
. as one who has been working on this matter since early 1986. i am pleased to see the threat of global climate change receiving the attention it deserves. is it too early to act. on the contrary. it is late. let us  waste time debating whether or  it is too late. there is lag time built into the climate system. even if we stopped all emissions of greenhouse gases tomorrow. we will experience global changes over the next 20. 30. or 40 years that will make earth warmer than it has been in the past 100.000 years. sea levels will rise. storm patterns will change. change is inevitable. the magnitude and rate of this change. however. as well as our ability to adapt to it. will depend on how quickly we respond to this threat and how quickly we reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
madam president. i recently introduced a resolution along with 11 of my colleagues addressing the issue of the slaughter of dolphins off the coast of japan by japanese fishermen. the resolution expressed the concern of the senate regarding the killing and called for the increased participation by the japanese government in international discussions aimed at eliminating further problems of this nature. i commend my colleague from rhode island senator petl. for adding the language of this resolution to s. 3076. japan has admirably recognized the issue that confronts them and has taken positive initiatives to promote the peaceful coexistence between fisherman and dolphin. the survival of cetaceans. however. is  solely the problem of the japanese. it is. rather. the concern of all nations whose livelihood brings them in conflict with the dolphin and other marine mammals that seek the same resources from the sea. that conflict will increase as more and more nations turn to the sea to meet rising global food requirements. and. as a result. the tradeoff disputes between the needs of the marine ecosystem and mans socioecoic system. so aptly displayed this winter in the sea of japan. will sharpen. the path toward settling those disputes lies in the proper understanding and kledge of cetaceans acquired at a cooperative international level. with the sharing of kledge and techogy. nations can work together toward the proper maintenance of a balanced marine environment which will. in turn. result in the most profitable harvesting of marine resources and a minimal effect on the future of cetaceans. the recent actions of the international whaling commission to establish whaling quotas is one such step in that direction. the u.s. law of the sea delegations attempts to promote an international cetacean commission in the law of the sea treaties is equally welcomed. it is in this spirit of international cooperation that i introduce the following amendment to the state department authorization bill. s. 3076. with this amendment i ask the secretary of state to encourage all nations with an interest in cetaceans.  just the japanese as the present language states. to participate in international discussions and exchanges which will further the understanding of these magnificent creatures. in addition. i ask the state department to encourage these nations to promote an international cetacean commission and to adopt comprehensive marine mammal protection legislation. madam president. i ask for passage of the amendment.
. next month. at stockholm. sweden. the united nations conference on thd human -environment will be held.. one of the most important objectives ofthe conference will be to establish a continuing organizationto deal with the problems of international protection of the environment. recently. the foreign relations subcommittee on oceans and the environment held some very useful hearings on the preparations for the stockholm conference. these hearings were chaired by my distinguished colleague. the senator from rhode island . one of the statements presented to the subcommittee was that of richard n. gardner. professor of law and international organization at columbia university. i believe his statement is worthy of the attention of all senators. therefore. i ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
