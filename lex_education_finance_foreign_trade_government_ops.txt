here are the facts. there is question about the bulge in enrollments. the banking and currency committee said in its report that the bottleneck in respect to college enrollment is housing. that is why they can accept the number of students who seek admission. especially in the public institutions. that is the area where they are most squeezed. the committee then goes on to point out that this kind of approach is uniquely applicable to the public institutions. in that many of the public institutions. which are antoous in many states. will find it attractive to do this if they only have to pay a low interest rate. there is. incidentally. a billiondollar backlog in obligations for direct loans through hew for college housing. obviously. they could  meet it. they have had a complete moratorium since 1966. it is impossible to meet that situation. so i cast about. in my mind. for some way to try to do the job. the banking and currency committee wanted $300 million for direct loans. which they said was minimal. hud said they would have to place $100 million in direct loans for the smaller institutions. because they can borrow on any terms. so that will leave the large institutions and the public institutions to utilize this new plan. that they say they can do. so what i did was take twothirds of the amount. leaving the total at $300 million. assume there is $100 million in direct loans. leaving $200 million subject to this kind of approach. when i drew the amendment i made it 2.5 percent of that amount. or $5 million. i tried to use my head. also. and give the senatcr something he could take or leave. . i ask that my amendment be modified to make the amount $4 million.
