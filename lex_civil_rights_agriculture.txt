. this particular title of the bill is my own. i introduced the original legislation to provide for consumer protection grants to public agencies. i had in mind especially my own work as attorney general of the state of new york. and of course. that of my successor. the present attorney general of the state of new york. louis lefkowitz who has been exemplary in this field. he has a fantastic reputation precisely for his work on consumer protection. the provision which the senator from th carolina in his amendment seeks to reach profit organizations. it came about because of the testimony we had in hearings and the feeling that the profit agencies ought to be included for two purposes--first.. to supplement the work that could be done in individual states. and second. to be available in the event a state fell down or did  submit a plan or its plan did  work out satisfactorily. it will be ed that section 305. which is the operative part of this particular proposition on page 33. referring to the funds which will be available. reads as follows:  to exceed 15 percentum of such funds shall be available for grants to local public agencies and private profit organizations for consumer protection programs  included in state plans. that would then indicate that this is  a publicstate plan operating. the next sentence deals with the situation that exists until a state has submitted a plan or. if the state fails to carry out a plan. then the director may make grants directly to local public agencies and profit private organizations. i point out that when a state does so. the state may completely preempt the field. that is why i found myself in agreement with this benefit which was grafted on to the fundamental title which i authored and felt very deeply about. i am glad that the senator from th carolina feels so deeply about it that he does  want the profit private organizations in it at all. my rationale in agreeing to this addition was that if there was an area of consumer protection excluded from state plansfor instance in a very small town or in a rural area. perhaps coterminus with some farm marketing area that had consumer protection plansi could see reason why the profits could  fit in there. second. if the state is slow in putting in a plan. as many states may be. or if a state merely attempts to block a local or profit private agency by putting in a comprehensive plan and by halfheartedly carrying out its plan of operation. the profit and local public agencies ought to be admitted. next. and very importantly. this is  a mandate. the director may or may  use this 15 percent for this purpose. the language of the law states that " to exceed 15 percent of such funds shall be available." further down where we deal with the power of the state to put in a plan or to operate its plan well. the operative language is that the director may make grants. so. we have complete jurisdiction. finally. it says 5050 matching. this is  strictly a grant program without matching. i feel that the mover of the amendment. the senator from th carolina. is obviously very interested in states rights as well as state opportunities. i think. however. that the scheme of legislation does  mandate any grants t profit agencies  even require them in the contingencies set forth in the bill itself. it is only if the state has plan or if the state falls down in the plan or is slow in submitting a plan. considering the state has the complete opportunity to block out any other grants to public agencies within its own area of jurisdiction or to profits by moving promptly with a major plan and covering the whole field. it seems to me that the permissiveness we have introduced by way of the cost sharing formula and other requirements as to what a profit or local public agency must contain. the scheme of legislation holds together. if it will be of any assistanceand i think that perhaps it will bei would like to ask the manager of the bill whether in his view. as in mine. we are . as it were. extending an invitation mandating profit agencies to come in or in any way limiting the jurisdiction of the director of this agencybut we are trying to provide for the following contingencies: first. if a state is slow in submitting a plan. second. if the coverage of the plan does  include areas which the director thinks should be covered. and third. if a state falls down in the plan. either in whole or in any area. in those instances. we wish to give the director the opportunity to use the profit or state agencies.
 nixon set forth his "buyers bill of rights." a fundamental of this bill of rights is the consumers right to accurate information on which to base a sound and informed choice between competing projects in the marketplace. the administration bill i am introducing today on behalf of myself and senators scott of pennsylvania and dominicx would help in achieving this goal by requiring full and honest labeling of ingredients for all foods. the major deficiency in the present food labeling provisions of law is that some food labels do  disclose their ingredients. foods for which a definition and standard of identity have been established pursuant to the food and drug act need  list mandatory ingredients on the label. in other words. the ingredients that must be in the food if it is to comply with the standard are  required to be listed on the label. there are approximately 300 standards covering such categories of foods as: cocoa products. wheat products. cheeses. desserts. canned foods. seafoods. mayonnaise. and ice cream. optional ingredientsthose that may be in the food but need  beare listed at the option of the fda. only foods for which there is standard of identity must disclose their ingredients. these distinctions do  make sense and the bill would simply require all foods to disclose their ingredients on the label on an equal basis. in effect. it is an antidiscriminatlon measure. i ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal. an explanation of the bill and the bill be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
