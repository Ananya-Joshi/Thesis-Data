canada does during the second. this was twice the rate  possess a large internal market. unlike of growth of the united states in 1985. european countries- canada does  have preferred access to a larger market through regional trading blocs. these factors explain why canada has been a very active participant in every round of multilateral trade negotiations over the last 40 years. we are and will remain leaders in the international efforts to press ahead with the new multilateral round scheduled to begin in september. we have. moreover a binding international agreement with the united states covering all our tradethe general agreement on tariffs and trade and this agreement conveys substantial rights and imposes heavy obligations upon both countries. we have one subsidiary but highly important trade agreement with the united states covering automobiles and several dealing with defence products. hence the question before us is  whether there should be a trade agreement between canada and the united states but rather whether we can go farther and do better than the present arrangements. to place this issue in perspective two way trade totalled us$ 118.8 billion in 1984. canada enjoyed a surplus on merchandize trade of us$ 15.4 billion. this surplus op merchandize account was second in impo:tance only to japan. our surplus. however. has  come under the same close scrutiny and criticism because the canadian market is essentially open. ample testimony to this is given by the fact that.u.s. exports to canada increased by over 20 percent in 1984. this should be contrasted with u.s. export performance in japan and the eec where the rates were 8 and 6 percent respectively. further the surplus we enjoy on the merchandize account is substantially offset by a large and traditional deficit we run with the united states on invisibles (i.e. interest. dividends. tourism and service payments). for 1984 the current account surplus was u.s. $6.7 billion. this was only the third year.since world war ii that canada enjoyed an overall surplus on current account. the other side of the coin. so to speak. is the importance of canada as a market for american goods and services. canada is by far the largest market for the united states. larger than japan and equal to the market offered by the member countries of the european community. canadian imports of u.s. goods in 1984 were us $46.5 billion. in the same year japan imported us $23.6 billion and the european community imported us $46.9 billion of u.s. goods. in 1984. canada. a nation of 25 million purchased more than 21.3 percent of all u.s. exports. moreover. 85 percent of these goods were fully or partially manufactured. in 1985. u.s. exports to canada increased by 12 percent. this increase in exports to canada should be contrasted with a decline in exports to the european community of 2 percent and a decline in exports to japan of 4 percent. again in 1985. the canadian market absorbed 22.3 percent of all u.s. exports. one of the most important things we want to do is to open up the vast u.s. market to canadian industry in order to increase its efficiency and competitiveness. through increased scale of production and greater specialization in certain products. canadian manufacturers would have a unique opportunity to incresse their competitiveness and efficiency. increase employment opportunities. and ultimately raise the real income of all canadian workers. new jobs are created and new investment is stimulated when the market is large egh to allow ecoies of scale and specialized production. better jobs are created when companies are confident about the future and are prepared to invest to remain competitive. whatever we can achieve in opening up the u.s. market. our present access to this market is under considerable threat. canadian jobs are lost and new jobs are  created when the united states imposes quotas or higher tariffs on trade. in many cases the threat of protectionist actions is as potent a deterrent to investment as is the actual imposition of a restrictive measure. examples which come readily to mind are the steel and softwood lumber issues. let me take a few moments on lumber. softwood lumber exports to the u.s.a. are an important ingredient in our bilateral trade. in 1984 they were valued at $c 3.3 billion. they are also a valued import as they make up the shortfall in u.s. production and meet the real needs of many users who prefer the species. size and quality of softwood lumber available from canada. lumber is  a new issue. the industry is prone to cycles of boom and bust. when the market is stong. canadian. softwood lumber is welcome. when the market turns down. the u.s. industry would like us to go -away lest the abundant supplies create a downward pressure on prices. in the current cycle the u.s. industry has alleged that canadian forest management and pricing practices are unfair. it has requested that steps be taken to either limit volume or raise prices of imported lumber. the canadian industry has been the subject of the most intense scrutiny for lithe past five years. two investigations by the itc under section 332 and a massive counter alling duty case have failed to provide evidence that would substantiate the u.s. lumber industrys claims. yet the pressure for limiting our access to your market for lumber continues to grow. today there are a number of bills before congress that would either raise canadian lumber prices. limit the volume or change the countervailing duty laws to make current canadian practices actionable. recognizing the seriousness of the problem. we have agreed to enter into high level. government to government talks in an effort to try and resolve the issue. these talks should be allowed to proceed without prejudice. the new protectionist threats come on top of an existing system of socalled contingency protection measures that pose an everpresent threat to many canadian exports. many canadian companies doing business in the united states find themselves compelled to hire expensive washington law firms as their u.s. competititors increasingly use the full array of u.s. trade remedy law inan effort to obtain relief from foreign conipftftion. through a new agreement. we want to wardoff the very real threat to existing canadian exports and canadian jobs posed by the sweeping new protectionist measures being put forward in congress. we want to seek to obtain an agreement with the united states that will help shield us against the continuing threat posed by existing protectionist measures in place in the united states. which have the effect of impeding exports and discouraging new investment in canada aimed at supplying the u.s. market. the third major objective for canada in these negotiations will be to enshrine the improved access to the u.s. market in a treaty or congressionalexecutive agreement. such treaty or agreement should include a strong dispute settlement mechanism to reduce the disparities in size and power and to provide fair. expeditious and conclusive solutions to differences of view and practices. it should also provide institutional and other provisions maintaining canadian independence of action in areas of national endeavour. while it may be clear why canada has initiated this process it may  be equally apparent why the united states should want to pursue a bilateral trade agreement with canada. in my opinion there are a number of compelling reasons. first as i mentioned earlier. canada offers the largest. fastest growing and in many respects the easiest market for u.s. goods and services. in 1985. we took 22.3 percent of all u.s. goods exports and ran a sizeable deficit with you on services. that was under the existing tariff structure. the average tariff facing goods flowing th is between 9 and 10 percent whereas the average level of u.s. tariffs is between 34 percent. it is therefore obvious that your trade could be considerably en.hanced by moving to a zero tariff across the board. second. a large and growing proportion of the u.s. ecoic activity lies in the service sector. given the proximity of our markets and the similarity of our ecoic systems we already have a flourishing twoway trade in services. traditionally. you have enjoyed a large surplus in this account. in 1984. the surplus was $14 billion. improved and more predictable access into the service sector would obviously open new markets for u.s. firms. looking beyond our bilateral horizon. there is an urgent need to begin developing international rules governing trade in services along the lines of those igatt rules that have served us well in the :goods trade. an agreement with canada on services providing a broad legal framework and effective disciplines could serve as an example -of what can be achieved in this new area. it could go a long way towards advancing our mutual interest in negotiating better international rules in the next mtn round. third. under the beading "improvements to trade in services" one could also envisage addressing a variety of regulatory issues that because of a lack of symmetry lead to the creation of trade barriers. here one might think of such arcane subjects as grading standards for potatoes or plywood. approval processes. business travel. etc. in a relationship as complex as ours. there are :hundreds of suich issues that impede trade. ..often inadvertently. fourth. there are a number of tariff barriers at both the federal and provincial levels which impede u.s. access to certain parts of the canadian market. in the united states you have such things as "buy america" preferences or restrictions. small business set asides. state and local government preferences. etc. in canada we have engaged in similar practices that have restricted u.s. access to certain areas of government purchasing or at the provincial level .have made it more difficult for u.s. suppli.ers to compete such as in the area of alcoholic beverage marketing. finally there is the area of foreign investment. as i pointed out earlier the mulroney government has made some very fundamental changes in this area. greatly reducing the regulatory scope of investment canada and increasing the transparency and predictability of the process. i understand that :some u.s. interests would like further movement in this area towards completely unfettered accessa condition i might add that does  exist in the united states. while this is a sensitive area. the government is on record as saying that it wants the broadest possible deal consistent with a balanced negotiation. there is a lot of optimism on both sides of the border about a new trade deal. there are also some serious worries. especially in canada. some canadians are extremely concerned about the effect these negotiations might have on canadian cultural industries and. therefore. on our ability to express our national ethos and to protect our essential sovereignty. country is more open than canada to foreign cultural products. anyone who doubts that should look at our bookstores. our theatres. our broadcasting system. our galleries and museums. equally country in the world is more committed than canada to making the rules of international commerce more transparent and fair. because we are so open. and because we live next door to the most powerful country in history with perhaps the most vibrant culture on earth. it is  surprising ..that preservation of our own cultural sovereignty has to be a preoccupation of the canadian government. .. but the commitment to preserving cultural sovereignty does  stop us from seeking better trade rules for cultural industries. from canadas point of view. better rules are both possible and desirable. we are prepared to discuss with the u.s. whatever concern you may have. we expect .a similar openness of your side. doubt. as .the negotiations proceed. your side will state that it can meet certain canadian demands. doubt. we will do the same. but there will be many issues on which we will be able to agree. this is the essence of negoitiations. these negotiations will  be the first time that canada and the u.s.a. will be sit.ting down to try and improve their trading relationship. seventyfive years ago. the government of sir wilfrid laurier concluded an agreement providing for reciprocity between canada and the u.s.a. this agreement has the crowning achievement :of lauriers liberal freetrade policy. it also sent the laurier government down to a crashing defeat. a lesson  lost on subsequent canadian governments. but.there is a happier lesson to be drawn from past historythe precedent setting .agreements canada and the u.s.a. negotiated in 1935 and 1938. these agreements established the "mostfavourednation" principle and began the dismantling of extensive trade barriers that had been thrown up in the wake of the smoothawley tariff. coming as they did in the depth of the depression they were a true :act of faith in the benefits to be derived from a more open trading system. the principles of these bilateral accords formed the foundation of the postwar multilateral trading system. the words smoothawley are often heard these days around washington on the lips of people who fear that protectionist pres- sure may be driving the u.s. towards an historic error. what is needed to avoid such an error. on your side of the border and on ours is an act of courage in our capacity to compete and an act of faith in the benefits of open markets. just as we made in the thirties. we. canada and the u.s.a.. have shown this leadership before. in our common interest. canada is on record as wishing to try to do .so again. the canadian government has taken the initiative. it will be brought to fruition only with broad based support in both our coun.tries. it requires that people like you who see the major ecoic and political benefits that can flow from such an agreement to actively promote it. i invite you to join me in countering the influence of the nay sayers that are always attracted to great initiatives. i invite you to join me in promoting an enterprise that will be good for canadians and americans alike.*
