. on december 8. 1967. robert c. wood. under secretary of the department of housing and urban development addressed the bemis lecture series in lincoln. mass. i want to commend the under secretary for his thoughtful and provocative discussion of the powerful forces at work in this country which are contributing to the polarization of our society. secretary wood has dropped cliches and platitudes in his approach to this difficult problem. it is  his intention here to dwell on the plight of the urban poor. though he ks it better than most. or to preach of the necessity to achieve a better and fuller life for all citizens. though he ks we must. he has taken upon himself in this speech to discuss the roles of all segments of our society in the business of building a better future and particularly to define and discuss that large body of americans who are resisting change. resisting the achievement of a better life for the greatly deprived. the "urbanites." as he calls them. who have turned off any ackledgement of public obligation. the questions posed here are: who are they. why do they feel and act as they do. and. what can be done about it. although i may  agree fully with every point or proposal expressed. i commend this excellent speech to my colleagues and urge them to give it their careful attention. for as secretary wood points out. the special tasks ahead of us. in building communities on a scale never dreamed of before while retaining a sense of community and a cohesive society of quality. challenge "every piece of wit and wisdom and instinct for common humanity that we possess." i include the full text of secretary woods remarks in the record:
