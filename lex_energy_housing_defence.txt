the gentleman will recall that when a somewhat similar bill with. reference to the military and air forces was before us last week. the gentleman and i discussed the question of new installations of oil burners and conversions from coal- to oilburning equipment. and he most satisfactorily answered the question i asked there. i k the gentleman believes that the question i am about lo ask has hing to do with this legislation. nevertheless. because i do believe the time is right  to.take care of the future i want to ask the gentleman again if it is the intention of the committee to place any limitation in the housing appropriation that i understand is involved in this bill. providing that there shall be such installations or conversions unless it can be clearly demonstrated that it is wise and ecoical to undertake it. mr. bates.of massachusetts. i think everybody is of the opinion that where we can conserve oil today we should. i k that is the gentlemans interest. it is my interest and the interest of everybody who has had the experience of a cold new england climate the last few years. to conserve wherever we can.. it can. of course. be tied into the provisions of this bill. as the gentleman understands. i am surely in sympathy with his ideas and hope that by every means possible oil will be conserved. especially fuel oil. that the effort will be made particularly by the navy department and all concerned. 1.
