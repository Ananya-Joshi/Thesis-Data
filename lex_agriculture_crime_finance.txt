. i have listened to all this debate. i can think anything but that this is the wrong way. utterly the wrong way to try to help either a farm enterprise or a small business. it operates arbitrarily. it can do justice as between the farmers themselves. and it does great injustice to all the people who are  farmers or small business people. but who need this relief just as much. the amendment is wellintentioned. i am sure. and it is perceived to be very beneficial by people with a certain special point of view. but for the average americanand i hope i am one--certainly this is absolutely the epitome of injustice and unfair treatment to the great majority.
