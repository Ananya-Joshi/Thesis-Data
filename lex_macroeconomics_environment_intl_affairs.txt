. i rise in support of the bill. which would authorize a voluntary contribution of $40 million by the united states to the united nations environment fund.  more than $10 million of which could be authorized for fiscal year 1974. as a member of the subcommittee that heard testimony on this legislation from a variety of witnesses. i want to e that i support the bill as reported from committee for a number of reasons. first. h.r. 6768 is a fitting fulfillment of the goals enunciated by many nations at the stockholm conference. second. it represents our involvement in a multilateral. worldwide effort to clean up our environment. specifically in the fields of identification and control of pollutants. monitoring. conservation. human settlements. information. exchange. education. training. and research. finally. i would point out that drastic reductions in the authorizations along the lines that some suggest today would in my view discredit and cast serious doubts  only on our commitment to the environment. but also on our very commitment to the united nations. i support the committee bill and urge my colleagues to oppose the crippling amendments being offered.
