. i wish to e that this is the 37th anniversary of two tragic events in the long history of the baltic states of estonia. latvia. and lithuania. from june 14 to 17. 1940. the soviet army invaded and occupied these independent republicsthe first stage of their eventual forcible annexation into the u.s.s.r. in order to insure their absolute control over these baltic states. 1 year later. in june 1941. the soviet government carried out a mass deportation of over 100.000 baltic people from this area to concentration camps in distant siberia. people were summarily loaded onto cattle carsfamilies were separated. food ran out before the end of the journey. the dead were left by the side of the railroad tracks. according to data collected by the lithuanian red cross. 34.260 people were deported from lithuania. 33.500 for estonia. and 35.102 for latvia. it was  until the late fifties that some of those who had survived their ordeals were allowed by the soviets to return to their homelands. even today. there are still many from these countries who are  permitted to live in their native areas. as a member of the commission on security and cooperation in europe. i am especially concerned with the problems of soviet compliance with the humanitarians provisions of the helsinki accords. today. as the belgrade conference is. underway. i am especially concerned that the political. religious. and cultural rights of lithuanians. estonians. and latvians be kept in mind. i am sure that the other members of the american delegation to the belgrade conference share my deep concern about these problems.
