i repeat my earlier question to the senator. how. under present day case law or constitutional law. is an individual prohibited from saying prayer in school at the present time. would the senator cite the case law or the appropriate article of the constitution where an individual is prohibited from praying.
we are  going to generalize . this erudite body. of which the senator is a member. can permit itself. during a debate as serious as this. a generalization that might be popularly accepted among the 80 percent out there that claim to say they want school prayer. again. i ask you for the case law or the appropriate section of the constitution which prohibits individual prayer in the schools.
