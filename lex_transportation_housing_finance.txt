. i do  wish to debate this matter with my distinguished colleague. i agree with him that it is a good amendment. he asks the question. what would we tie it onto or what vehicle would be used. i mention the emergency mortgage credit bill on which i think we are going to have hearings on around march 19. i think this provision could be tagged on at that time. and we would have an opportunity to see what the impact would be. would the senator from minnesota be willing to accepti am sure he will accept the chairmans word that there will be hearings. i am trying to suggest to him the hearings could be as early as the 19th of march.
