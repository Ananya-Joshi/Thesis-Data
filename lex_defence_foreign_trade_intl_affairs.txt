madam president. i am fully behind the presidents decision to sell these arms to saudi arabia. i agree with him that congressional disapproval of the sale was illadvised and shortsighted. and i urge all senators who voted against the sale to think over todays vote very carefully. this sale is in the best interests of the united states. and it seems to me that that is the criterion by which we should be guided. in order to outline why i oppose the resolution of disapproval passed by the senate a few weeks ago. let me review the main arguments upon which that resolution was based. first. opponents of the sale argue that saudi arabia does  need these missiles. in my opinion. saudi arabia is a far better judge of its own defensive needs than are the members of congress. situated as it is in the heart of an extremely unstable. turbulent region. saudi arabia is in dire need of better air defense capabilities. although the saudi -air force possesses only 60 modern fighter planes. it must protectan airspace equal to that of the east-. ern united states. the sidewinder and harpoon missiles contained in this package would greatly assist the saudis in preventing the iraniraq conflict from spilling over into their country. i need  add that such an expansion of the gulf war would threaten vital. u.s. ecoic interests in the middle east. particularly access to the gulf itself. i think that is clear. and we all recognize that. at least. we k it and we should recognize it. let us  forget that when they defend the gulf. the saudis defend a key united states strategic concern. if we begin  to back out of our longstanding arms supply relationship with the saudis. the chances of direct united states military involvement in the region will be greatly increased. a second major argument against the sale is that saudi arabia doesnt deserve these missiles. opponents claim that the saudis have  contributed to the mideast peace process. but rather. have actually stood in the way of peace. well. i am  sure that we apply to all the nations we deal with a requirement that they deserve to be able to purchase arms from us. indeed. we do  apply it to many countries we deal with. to which we give grants or loans on a very generous basis. i agree with the president that saudi arabia. an important mideast friend of the united states for 40 years. continues to play an extremely important role as a voice of moderation in the arab world. they share many interests with the united states. and have assisted us in a number of significant ways. as the presidents national security adviser. adm. john m. poindexter. recently wrote: the saudis worked closely and diligently with us in the search for a peaceful solution in leba. they continue to provide critically needed support to the afghan freedom fighters. to the government of pakistan and to moderate forces in sudan. they provide important support to the world bank and the imf. and are one of the few countries with which we maintain an important positive balance of trade. the fez plan of king fahd helped transform the 15yearold arab donsensus of confrontation with israel into a quest for an acceptable basis for peace. this major saudi diplomatic effort with other arabs provided a crucial underpinning for individual efforts such as king husseins initiative. it constituted a significant step toward enabling the arab world to come to terms with the need for peace with israel. most important. the saudis are a key prowestern presence in the middle east. who have demonstrated their willingness to stand up against arab radicals. they continued to support jordan when king hussein flew in the face of the extremists by restoring relations with egypt and working for negotiations between israel and the palestinians. more recently. the saudis played a leading role in blocking an arab summit sought by qadhafi in order to condemn the united states raid on libya. they also refused to support qadhafis proposal of panarab sanctions and an embargo against the united states. the refusal of saudi arabia and jordan to give their support to qadhafis antiamerican schemes so infuriated the libyan leader that he discussed a possible libyan withdrawal from the arab league. the third major argument of the sales opponents ties the saudis to mideast terrorism. and portrays this sale as a corltribution to arab terrorist groups. like all other arab states. the saudis undeniably have ties to syria and the palestinians. but to equate the saudis with these other arabs is absurd. this argument demonstrates a dangerous inability to distinguish arab friends from arab enemies. despite the saudis obvious moderation. their refusal to participate in qadhafis antiamerican schemes. and their willingness to address united states concerns about terrorism. there are some who continue to oppose this sale. i am baffled by their reasoning. and hope that they will consider one final point. if this sale is requested. in addition to sending a message to saudi arabia and .he rest of the arab world that we are  unable to maintain any friendships with arabs. a rejection of this sale would play directly into the hands of qadhafi and his ilk. following the congress initial disapproval of the sale. libyan propaganda seized on this rebuff of saudi arabia. the country which had. as i mentioned. thwarted qadhafis attempt to call an antiamerican arab summit. the libyans stated: the childkiller reagan administration has refused to supply saudi arabia with the weapons it has been trying to get from the u.s .... the arab rulers who expected u.s. gratitude for impeding the arab summit and its confrontation of the barbarous u.s. atlanticist aggression on the people of (libya] got hing from the u.s. administration except. being insulted and forced to bow. we must show that the united states ks who its friends are and what policies are in its best interests. our efforts to counter antiamerican and sovietinfluenced states such as libya. iran and syria. rely heavily on our continued close ties with traditionally friendly states such as saudi arabia. if the sale is rejected. the united states will have humiliated a friend and will have stated publicly that longer do we wish to be a player. to exert any influence in an area of the world that is of extraordinry importance to us.

 at all. i believe  at all. first of all. as i pointed out. over 1.000 dissidents have been released as a result of the quiet diplomacy we have had. there is being built up. as i mentioned. in the southern part of china. a whole new nation of entrepreneurs. the united states has invested some $5 billion in china overall. most of that in the southern part of china. that is leading. to new chinese ecoic reforms. but i can say to the distinguished senator from massachusetts everything is going to be fine. on all of these issues we make judgments. based  only on the situation as it exists . but based on our experience and what we have seen. one thing we k is that there is difference between denial of mfn. and mfn with a whole series of conditions that we have never levied on any other nation. as i mentioned. the only reason for denial of mfn we have ever had with aher nation is for its violation of the jacksonvanik amendment. so here we are embarking on whole new territory and dealing with the export of missiles. and the freedom of dissidents. and on and on the list goes. proud nation. and certainly china is a proud nation. is going to countenance that. they are going to say. you put us under these conditions. we are  going to observe them. i think we can expect that. i think it is a great mistake proceeding along those lines. i make one further point that i believe is quite important. and that is this requirement of the majority leader that the president of the united states must certify that there has  been the transfer of missiles tolet me read this particular provision- must certify that china has  transferred certain missile techogy to syria. iran. and pakistan. we can prove a negative. who in the world is going to be able to get up and say we swear that there have  been these transfers. we can do that.
. the writing is clearly written on the wall. the situation is being set up for it. the question isand i have raised it before and raise it again today in the most decided and vigorous way in which i am capable of raising itare we prepared with alternative plans as to what we will do. are we prepared to take some initiative in the situation. i deeply believe that initiative on the part of the united states is necessary. it will  do in berlin merely to sit back and wait to see what the russians do. because what they are going to do is again to face us with some fait accompliwith some finished act to which we find it very difficult to react effectively. the best example of that is the berlin wall. which was put up overnight. there it was. the implication being that if we wanted to push it down. we would have to go to war. we should  allow ourselves to be put into those positions time and time again. one lesson should be egh. therefore. by way of suggesting to the state department what might be done in a situation of that character. in terms of displaying initiative. i would like to make the following suggestions for the departments consideration. the first is the possibility of formally incorporating west berlin into the german federal republic. such an act would serve as a great psychological boost for the west berliners. they would be a part of somethinginstead of hanging out there in the middle of communist space with the assurances. of course. given by the allies and their forces. but unconnected with any juridical attachment of a substantial kind with the rest of the people of germany. also it would confront the soviets with the kind of unilateral action to which they have repeatedly subjected us. an action of a very effective and vigorous kind. because it would serve ice in the most serious terms in which that ice could be served that west berlin would  be relinquished. that is suggestion  1 for the consideration of our authorities. suggestion  2 is an embargo by the members of nato on trade with east germany. if such action could be effectively implemented in company with our allies. it would demonstrate to the soviets that we mean business in every respect and would confront them with the practical alternative of relinquishing their threats to west berlin or depriving the already rotting ecoy of east germany of needed materials and foreign exchange. let us remember that the mere suggestion of such an embargo was egh to release traffic over the autobahn  so many months ago when the east germans threatened the west germans with tying it up. it was  threatening us. it was threatening the west germans. who apparently have some means to protect themselves in those situations which might very well be used . the third suggestion is in respect to united nations action. it has been said that the soviet union expects to raise the problem of berlin in the general assembly. which will begin to meet this month. i do  recommend that our country raise the issue there because i think as far as we are concerned this is essentially a fourpower issue. we are much better off in keeping it that way. but if it is raised by the communists. then i would certainly join in to make good the challenge in the general assembly because i think we can bring a great impact to bear through such a debate on the committed nations. which should be made aware in the most dramatic way of the differences between east and west berlin in spirit. in freedom. and in living conditions. indeed. i think we should welcome a united nations commission to investigate the berlin problem. that commission could then seek at least freedom of action to travel through east berlin and east germany. and its findings. i am confident. would certainly sustain the position of the free world and militate very strongly against the position of the communist world. i am sure that the state department planners have other ideas in addition to those that i have mentioned. however. i have mentioned some. the main thrust of my argument. in the face of headlines which read: "berlin deadline set for russians." meaning that there is going to be a change in the checkpoint. and the main burthen of my speech today is that at long last we must take the initiative in berlin. the russians have torn up the four power agreement as a scrap of paper. we all understand that. they have severed the city in two. this gives us the opportunity for prompt action of which we must be able to avail ourselves.  only with respect to regular soviet movesand one ks what the next move will bebut also in anticipating that again an effort will be made to produce an accomplished fact which will further reduce the viability of the allied presence in west berlin. it seems to me that with the use of a little ingenuity and by taking action in advance. we might face the soviet union with an uncomfortable accomplished fact which would very affirmatively entrench our presence there and give reassurance to the west berliners. who are understandably concerned. as is shown by the street activity which they undertook. and which we can understand. considering the provocations to which they have been subjected. but which nevertheless have the threat of making american policy on the streets of berlin. which we can have. therefore. i believe we must show initiative through activities and actions which are affirmative and are tangible and which at the same time will bring assurance to the city of west berlin. because it will serve ice on the russians of our determination. which we have already expressed. and will also present to them the firm governmental organization indicating that we intend to take action to back up words. by means which they can understand. i have suggested three courses of action. namely. the incorporation of west berlin into the federal republic of germany. an embargo by nato against trade with east germany. and some action through the united nations. which would bring before the world in a most dramatic way the difference between the situation in east berlin and west berlin. again i repeat that the state department planners probably have a number of other ideas on the planning board. however. the time has come for us to move and  sit still and wait for the next russian action before we react.
