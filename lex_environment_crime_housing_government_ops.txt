. i want to take a moment to express my sincere regret for the loss of our colleague and my chairman. quentin burdick. my deepest sympathy goes out to  of the committee on environment and public works and the appropriations subcommittee on agriculture. rural development and related agencies. senator burdick fought hard to protect the interests of his home state and rural america. in addition to his efforts on behalf of the nations farmers. senator burdick was a champion of public works development and the environment. he led the fight to enact the intermodal surface transportation and efficiency act and the recent amendments to the clean air act. his lowkey style often belied his tireless efforts in the trenches to get the job done. so it is with great humility and respect that i rise as an original cosponsor of legislation to designate the recently .authorized federal building in fargo. nd. as the "quentin n. burdick united states court house." i can think of greater tribute to a man who gave so much to his beloved home state of th dakota. i will miss my friend. but recognize. too. that i worked together with a good and decent man. quentin burdick. who through his life made this country a better and stronger nation.
