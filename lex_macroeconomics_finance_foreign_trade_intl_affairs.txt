. i strongly oppose any amendment to strike the $70.1. million funding for the general capital increase [gci] for the world bank. the united states must continue to exercise its leadership role in promoting marketoriented ecoic reforms in developing countries. such steps should benefit the u.s. trade and ecoic position. especially as developing nations represent major opportunities for significant u.s export growth. the united states is the largest cntributor to the world bank and therefore has a unrivalled position to influence the banks policies in positive directions. yet the united states is  the only major industrial country  to have agreed to contribute to the gci. if the united states does  contribute. the gci will still take effect. but the u.s. role will be lessened. it would be unwise to allow this to occur. for issues important to the united states will be stressed at the world bank. these include: environmental protection as a permanent priority. policy measures conducive to private investment and private enterprise development. production of primary commodities only where such production is efficient and provides satisfactory rates of return without subsidies. and financing complemented by other sources. such as private flows. to ensure that the oci will  be a substitute for commercial bank lending. the united states should  forfeit its leadership role . the direct trade aspect also can be understated. in fiscal year 1987. u.s. businesses exported $1.6 billion worth of goods and services to world bankfinanced projects. this is more than the total united states paid in capital since the world banks founding. for these reasons.  to mention the democratic and humanitarian benefits that. would result. this funding should go forward. and i strongly encourage my colleagues to vote against any amendments that would weaken this provision of the foreign assistance and related programs appropriations bill.
