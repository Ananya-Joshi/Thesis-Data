. today i am introducing legislation amending the food stamp act of 1977 to provide for more equitable distribution of benefits to those households suffering from exceedingly high home heating costs. spiraling energy costs seriously affect all of us. but particularly the nations poor who must spend a large portion of their income to heat their homes. leaving little to cover other basic household necessities such as food. rent. and clothing. the department of energy reports that home heating costs are skyrocketing. outpacing overall consumer price rises by 100 percent. for example. from january 1975 to june 1978. home heating oil prices increased 52 percent while overall consumer prices increased 25 percentand predictions for the future are equally discouraging. my proposal addresses these rising costs. while i support the intent of the food stamp reforms to improve program efficiency and operation while maintaining fiscal responsibility. the 1977 acts newly imposed excess shelter cost cap fails to reflect the wide regional disparities relative to home heating costs. for example. annual home heating costs in the theast are approximately 51 percent higher than in the south and approximately 87 percent greater than costs reported for the western states. how then does this arbitrary shelter cost cap impact on those states burdened with such energy costs. the overall result has been a drastic reduction in benefits for many households or a change in eligibility status. in my own state of rhode island. 60 to 70 percent of the program recipients have lost some of their benefits as a result of the 1977 act and approximately 4 percent of the pre1977 households will become ineligible for benefits of any kind. my amendment attempts to alleviate these inequities by increasing the limit on excess shelter cost deductions. presently. the shelter cost cap stands at $80. my proposal would raise this figure to $105. the shelter cost limit would continue to be adjusted every july 1 and january 1 to reflect changes in the cpi. raising the shelter cost deduction recognizes existing regional differences relative to energy consumption and permits those households most vulnerable to rising heating costs to claim a lower net dollar income. thereby qualifying them for an increased allotment of food stamps with which to adequately feed their families. in addition to providing more equitable distribution of benefits. raising the limit. instead of totally removing it. retains an important feature of the food stamp programfiscal responsibility. while my proposal will require some increase in total program expenditures. i believe it is a necessary measure and one which will underscore the federal governments longstanding commitment to help our nations poor.* by mr. ribicoff (for himself.
. i am pleased to be a cosponsor of senator staffords amendment. which preserves food stamp benefits for those americans receiving federal energy assistance payments. under the bill  before us. energy assistance payments would be counted as income for the purpose of determining food stamp benefits. this would hit millions of lowincome americans with food stamp reductions during the winter monthswhen the need for good nutrition is greatest. in my home state of rhode island. for example. this provision in the bill would lower food stamp benefits by $17.60 per month for the average recipient. this was clearly  the intent of congress when it established the low income energy assistance program. this program was intended to give the poor. elderly. and disabled extra help in heating their homes in the wintertime. these fuel assistance payments are intended to supplement to supplantother forms of federal assistance. such as food stamps. we often hear of those who are faced with the "heat or eat" dilemma. this is precisely the choice that will be faced by 11 million needy americans. if the energy assistance provisions of this bill are retained. i urge my colleagues to follow the lead of the distinguished senator froth vermont by voting to strike these provisions from the bill.

. in el salvador. we watch a tragedy in its final scenes. nearly 9.000 civilians have died there in the first half of this year alone. enter the americans. well into the last act. with men and materiel and talk of making the country safe for democratic elections. but. if anything. the killing of inent people has escalated. and much of it is reportedly the work of security forces and the very military we are backing. in a recent address to the world affairs council. thomas enders. assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs. paraphrased the good neighbor policy to mean that "we can be indifferent to outside threats to the security of any friendly country so close to our shores." but the greatest threats to el salvadors security are coming from within. as a roman catholic bishop in san salvador recently declared. "the pity is that the united states supports this government because it is friendly to the united states. it is  friendly with its own people." assistant secretary of state enders went on to say that: when trained guerrillas with outside backing take up machineguns. mortars and recoilless rifles. amount of fertilizers. schools or clinics can prevent them from sowing terror or attempting to seize power by force. this is most certainly true. but neither can we expect to rush in just before the final curtain with guns and helicopters and anticommunist rhetoric. prop up a government at war with its people and wrest a democratic solution. the mort important question for us to ponder may well be this: where were we. the united states. in act i. when the forces that fuel this conflict began to brew. in 1973. according to the united nations. the top 10 percent of the salvadoran population owned more than threefourths of the land. while the poorest 10th of the people held less than half of 1 percent. as a result. while the overall per capita gnp in 1977 was $550. an estimated 2.6 million of the countrys 4.5 million people had annual per capita incomes below $250. recent attempts at land reform are beginning. ever so slowly. to right this imbalance. but with one of the highest birth rates in the world. el salvadors scarcity of land is sure to be aggregated. and the already widespread hunger and illiteracy can only become worse. housing and health ser vices are also shamefully inadequate. what was needed in el salvador before death squads became a act of lifeand what is needed throughout central americais  american arms and  just american money either for the latter is likely to line the pockets of the oppressors. what was and is needed are american doctors. american teachers. american engineers. and above all american concern for the abject poverty that. long iged. breeds communist opportunism. el salvador and her neighbors in central america today manifest the failure of u.s. policy over the last two decades. the paternalism. neglect. and anachronism of that policy have succeeded only in alienating our natural allies in this hemisphere and opened the door to the soviets. we can simply then adopt a bunker mentality toward the forces which have been unleashed in that region of the world. if we do. we add fuel to the fires which are burning  in el salvador. guatemala. and honduras. the heat of which will be painfully felt by the united states in the near future. out of the ruins of this policy we must build a new relationship to the existing emerging states of latin america. such a policy will require the fullest measure of american idealism. leadership and strength. it will require the education and support of the american people. it will require boldness and courage. that policy must be built. first and foremost. on respect for the sovereignty and selfdetermination of latin american peoples. our relations to those states must communicate our regard for their right to exist and act.  only as a piece on a global game board. but in their own right. that poicy should address itself to meeting the basic human needs of the millions who have suffered from abject poverty and ecoic oppression. we must be actively involved through ecoic assistance in developing the human and physical resources. which can produce indiges ecoice development and elevate the dignity and quality of life of the least fortunate of the region. that policy should proceed conceptually on the basis of present day realities rather than the dictates of ideology or diplomatic momentum. teddy roosevelt. harry truman. and john kennedy do  provide answers for todays problems. only echoes of bygone eras we had best put behind us. finally that policy must be founded on the cherished values of democratic rule and human rights. ultimately. security and stability in human society is achieved only through respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. for the united- states to -proceed on any other basis would compromise our integrity and deny our greatest strength. x would encourage my colleagues to reflect on where we have been. where we are and the choices we must make if we are to preserve and enhance our influence in this vital region. for the sake of the victims of poverty and conflict. our present day national interests and the next generation of americans. th. central. and south. who must inherit this world. let us hope that the choices we make are the right ones.
