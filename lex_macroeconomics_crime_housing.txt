. arson for profit is one of the most devastating problems confronting our society today. it is a grave and growing crime which claims over 1.000 lives and 10.000 injuries across the united states each year. according to the u.s. fire administration. over 177.000 fires are deliberately set in buildings each year in this country. accounting for property losses of more than $2 billion. the toll extends far beyond this tragic loss of life and destruction of property. arson disrupts lives. displaces families and demoralizes communities. it imposes tremendous burdens on our cities to provide housing and services to citizens whose homes are damaged or destroyed. arson strains city budgets. it drives tax bases down and consumer insurance costs up. it threatens the safety of dedicated firefighters. it erases historic and cultural imprints which can be retraced and erodes the character and identity of neighborhoods. the partnership working to combat arson has included municipal fire and police units. state law enforcement agencies. and such federal agencies as the fbi. the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. and the u.s. fire administration which. with a modest budget. has coordinated effective firefighting. prevention. and control programs. it is important for congress to recognize that aher extremely effective force has emerged in the fight against arson. communitybased arson prevention groups have become organized in many cities during the last several years. they are comprised of people who have the most to lose in neighborhoods threatened by arson. and the t to gain by assuring its preventionpeople who live with the fear or arson on a daily basis and who k its causes. costs. and consequences. one of the most successful community arson prevention programs has been organized in providence. r.i.. by the citizens group "stop wasting abandoned property." swap was formed in 1976 as a profit homesteading organization whose goal was to reduce the citys housing abandonment rate. swap has helped revitalize the community by acquiring and arranging for the sale and reation of some 250 vacant houses. however. the persistent problem of arson threatened to eliminate many structures before swap could save them. through the efforts of ms. marty gruer and other members of swap. a citywide coalition was formed in 1981 to reduce arson through preventive efforts. city agencies. historic preservationists. social service units. housing organizations and others joined with swap to mount a campaign of public awareness and to develop arson prevention strategies. one of the organizations most able successes has been to secure the enactment of legislation requiring those who own buildings to file information pertaining to their insurance coverage with the city clerk. the group has worked to develop an early warning system which begins with research into a buildings cycle of deterioration and leads to the pinpointing of highrisk structures. working with the arson prevention unit of the providence public safety department. citizen volunteers conduct surveillance of these buildings in order to deter those who contemplate arson. the result of the coalitions efforts has been striking. since arson prevention activities began. providences rate of arson in buildings has decreased by 31 percent. according to chief michael moise of the providence fire department. other cities have witnessed similar improvements as the result of arson prevention programs in which community organizations have played a prominent role. these groups include peoples firehouse in new york city. urban education systems in boston. the cleveland antiarson coalition. as well as organizations in seattle. wash.. springfield. mass.. new haven. conn.. and other cities. arsonforprofit is often motivated to offset financial loss. collect inflated insurance claims or to empty buildings for demolition or rehabilitation. an alarming incidence of suspicious fires has occurred in buildings for which government rehabilitation loan moneys have been approved. arson prevention programs include efforts to identify potential arson crimes by tracking a buildings history of fires. fire code violations. title transfers. tax arrears. and vacancies. this leads to priority code enforcement. watchdog activities. building management assistance. seal up and rental of vacant buildings. foreclosures and ownership transfers. community groups have also assisted in providing education and training programs for residents to alert citizens about the causes of arson and involve them actively in preventive efforts. the u.s. fire administration is planning to establish a national arson prevention program in which communitybased organizations will play a role. clearly. arson prevention activities which originate from within neighborhoods can do a great deal to supplement the work of city. state. and federal governments in this critical endeavor. congress owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to these community activists. they should be encouraged to press forward with their efforts through increased recognition and support. it is my hope that the u.s. fire administration and other agenices will continue to involve community organizations in arson prevention programs. congress should follow these activities carefully and work to encourage an approach which enables community arson prevention organizations to pay a prominent role in combating this devastating crime. i am. therefore. today submitting a resjolution to ackledge the outstanding contribution which is being made by community arson prevention organizations and convey to them our gratitude and commendation. in addition. my resolution encourages the u.s. fire administration to continue to utilize the support and resources of these community groups in implementing its future arson prevention programs and activities. i hope my colleagues will join with me in adopting this resolution.

. i. too. am a cosponsor of this measure. i feel very deeply about it and always have. i have fought for this for many years. rather than address myself to the arguments which have been made so very eloquently by the other senators. i would just like to add one very practical point. we have found by experience in new york. and it has also been found to be true in other cities. that the pragmatic aspect of the open housing stands up. that the fears that the neighborhood will be destroyed and property values will be lessened are found to be baseless. and that. if anything. property values go up because there is a broader market. the ecoic capability of individuals very largely determines the type of people who live in a community. the people are found to be congenial. whatever the color of their skin may be. that is history and factually demonstrable and has been convincing to many of those who have been in such terrible fear that their neighborhood will become a ghetto because a negro buys a house there. the socalled blockbustersthe conscienceless real estate agents who spread fear and rumor in order to buy sacrificed propertyare doing so with a very good understanding of that fact. they are  buying it to take a loss. the very fact that they are buying the property indicates that they k that the very rumor they are spreadingthat property values will be destroyedis  true. they buy the property and they take a profit. i hope that this represents a word of warning to all who may be susceptible to this kind of alarm which has been demonstrated to be so baseless. one of the most outstanding examples of that is the socalled levittown structures in the united states. where for a very long time. it was thought that it would be impossible to have open housing without a destruction of the character of the development and property values until it was actually tried. pursuant to a uniform rule where everybody was bound the same way. that assurance is what was insisted on there. and as soon as it was given. open housing was found to have harmful ecoic effect at all. the levittowns are as beautiful and as attractive as ever. and the company is about to be sold to the i.t. & t. for $90 million. the second point which is very im-" portant is. what does an open housing law mean to the dweller in the ghetto who can even think about affording a house in the ghettos. it means to him dignity.-if you search deep down for the reasons for the riotsand we will do so in the committee on government operations. in due courseyou will find inevitably buried in all of it is the issue of personal dignity. that is the real thing in detroit. there were many jobs in detroit. with a fairly high standard of living and income in the ghettos. but it was the affront. the oppression to dignitythe senator from michigan will correct me if i am wrongthat incited even them to riot. or at least the small portion that did riot in that area. and the community climate which makes it possible. the big thing about dignity is encompassed in housingthe fact that you are told that you may  live here. expressly or impliedly. and therefore you are some kind of a debased human being. some kind of monster that people can tolerate having around. i am glad that the senator from minnesota has stirred up this discussion today. it is a very pertinent time to do so. as we search out our own consciences. forget about the basic causes of riots but when a cause is just. it is the duty of government to take account of it and try to do something about it. and  to act out of resentment. to refrain from acting because there has been a riot is as great an act of injustice as to perpetuate the injustice which was one of the basic causes in bringing it about. i hope that what the senator has donewhich is very constructive and usefulwill sound this e to the country at this critical time. that we may follow through with courage. that withstanding the pitfalls and the difficulties. we will be able to get a bill out of the committee on banking and currency and pass it.
. headed by a former colleague. tom curtis of missouri. after exhaustive testimony. e of the facts there adduced that brought about reasonable federal control have changed. in my state of new york. the city of new york has. generally speaking. an effective rent control mechanism. again. without french style rent control. where properties had to be permitted to rot because increased costs could  be passed on. the amendment of the senator from new jersey guarded against that. and quite properly. then. outside of new york city. in the suburbs surrounding new york. where we have a population in the area of 2.5 million to 3 million people. where vacancy rates of less than 2 percent exist. some landlords. before they will give anyone any kind of lease for any period of time. insist on a 20- to 40percent rent increase. with rent constituting 25 to 30 percent of the family budget. i could  think of anything to fire inflation more. this is something we can and should avoid. it is a national problem. and we should  depend on state legislatures where there may be a rural feeling and a feeling against rent controls which does  express the interest of the nation or justice in the suburban community. i have illusion as to where the senator from new jersey is going with this motion. and neither does he. the important thing is that the position should be maintained and the matter should be pressed on the administration. it would have full authority under this law as it had before and i would urge at the very least what we have said and are prepared to prove may be the subject for appropriate action once the basic authority is granted. but in the interim i shall vote for and support the senator from new jersey. as i have before because i feel he is right on the merits and the substantive matter.
