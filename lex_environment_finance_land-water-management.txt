. this amendment builds upon the excellent work of the appropriations committee with respect to epas program to control destruction of the earths protective ozone shield. it directs that epa use some of the funds being provided in this act to examine an ecoic issue that may have significant environmental effects. the problem is this. on august 1. 1988. epa is planning to promulgate regulations that implement the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. we are all for that. that was a magnificent achievement. as many of us will remember. the montreal agreement calls for a phased 50percent reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons [cfcs] between  and 1998. the theory is that a 50percent reduction will stimulate sufficient market demand for substitutes and lead to the voluntary phaseout of regulated cfcs. however. a number of experts have analyzed this situation and concluded that this may  be the case. unless the regulations mandate a virtual elimination of cfcsa position that i have been advocating for some time we will be creating a false market setting where supply is artificially reduced and demand stays high. that will lead to higher prices and. in turn. undeservedly large profits for producers of cfcs. if these profits are large egh. the producers may have an incentive to delay the introduction of safe substitutes. from an environmental standpoint. that would be unacceptable. the obvious solution is some mechanism to recapture these excess profits. the difficulty here is the fact that. unless the program is structured just so. the producers will simply pass the cost of any fee or tax along to the consumer and still reap their profits. this amendment will force epa to examine some of these important issues and should help the agency or congress design a solution to lhis problem.
