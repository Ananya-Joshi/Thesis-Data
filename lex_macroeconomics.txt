. i am pleased to be joined today by senators graham. lincoln. torricelli. . and kohl in introducing the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001 closes a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the eligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child support orders. that of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents who are delinquent in paying their courtordered financial support for their childrdn. under current law. eligibility for the federal tax refund offset program is limited to cases involving mis. parents on public assistance. or adult children who are disabled. custodial parents of adult. disabled children are  assisted under the irs tax refund intercept program. and in many cases. they must work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. some of these parents have gone into debt to put their collegeage children through school. the legislation we are introducing today will address this inequity by expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program to cover parents of all children. regardless of whether the child is disabled or a mi. this legislation will  create a cause of action for a custodial parent to seek additional child support. in will merely assist the custodial parent in removing debt that is owed for a level of child support that was determined by a court. improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that should be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the united states. according to the most recent government statistics. there are approximately twelve million active cases in which a child support order requires a custodial parent to contribute to the support of his or her child. of the $22 billion owed in 1999. only $12 billion has been collected. in 1998. only 23 percent of children entitled to child support through our public system received some form of payment. despite federal and state efforts. similar shortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately $47 billion. we can fix this injustice in our federal tax refund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents receivethe financial assistance they are owed. while previous administrations have been somewhat successful in using tax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments. more needs to be done. the irs tax refund interception program has only collected onethird of tardy child support payments. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001 will remove the current barrier to fulfilling an individuals obligation to pay child support. while helping to provide for the future of our nations children. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record.
. i commend senator grassley and senator baucus for their hard work on this tax package. i k they have worked hard to forge a bipartisan tax package and worked hard to make that happen. however. i will join senator carper in offering an amendment which will reduce the size of the tax cut to $1.2 trillion. the reason i join senator carper is i believe there is a whole population forgotten in this tax debate. and that. is the propertytax payer. of course. one of the federal mandates that is the hardest and most onerous on the propertytax payers is the special education costs. the supreme court ruled in the early seventies that all students have to be educated in the public school system. congress acted by passing the individuals with disabilities education act which said we will get the funding up to 40 percent. of course. we have never gotten above 12. 13. 14 percent. and there is a very onerous cost to the communities in property taxes. we are proposing to reduce this to $1.2 trillion which. of course. leaves about $150 billion available for the property tax relief. that should be done on idea. property taxes are the most difficult on communities and on individuals because with an income tax. if ones fortunes decline. one pays less income tax. on a sales tax. if one does do  want to purchase goods. one pays less in sales tax. with a property tax. it is most onerous because it is always there. whether your fortunes decline. lose a job. lose a spouse. the income part of your propertytaxpaying abilities. and also if you become elderly and want to keep your house. of course. that property tax is always there. we are  talking about taxes. we need help for the propertytax payers by leaving money available to give relief in idea. something we promised in the early seventies. passed in 1975. and we have  done it. if we are  doing it with the surpluses we have. we will never do it. a vote for the carperchafee amendment is a vote for property tax relief.
. the central tenet of this bill is reducing the tax cut down to $1.2 trillion. we would devote the other $150 billion towards educational initiatives. how many of us have heard from our constituents about the high cost of the property taxes. the main contribution to these high property taxes is the cost of special education. and that is a federal mandate. let us right  reduce the tax cut and put it towards idea and property tax relief. i urge adbption of the carperchafee property tax relief amendment.
madam president. i would like to take this time to recognize the week of october 2128 as "world population awareness week." rapid population growth and urbanization have become catalysts for many serious environmental problems. they are applying substantial pressures on infrastructure. manifested especially in pollution. transportation. health. sanitation. and public safety problems. these all make urbanization an issue we can afford to ige. cities and urban areas today occupy only two percent of the earths land. but contain half of the worlds population and consume 75 percent of its resources. therefore. it is important for us to recognize the problems associated with rapid population growth and urbanization. gover lincoln almond has proclaimed the week of october 2128 as "world population awareness week" in rhode island. i ask that gover almonds proclamation be printed in the record.
madam president. i rise today in support of the amendment sponsored by senators gregg. feingold. kerry. voiich. mccain. and myself. this is a commonsense amendment that extends existing appropriations caps and payasyougo rules for aher 5 years. in addition. the amendment strengthens some budget enforcement mechanisms. the senators that have spoken before me have done an admirable job of explaining the provisions in the bill. i want to stress the necessity of fiscal discipline. every day constituents and experts talk to me about spending programs that are vitally important to them. asking me to support increased spending. just as often i hear from people who want to do away with some tax. or lower a tax. they all have excellent arguments. and there is much merit to the initiatives they would like me to support. the problem is that if i were to support each of them. i would be supporting an agenda of cutting taxes and increasing spending. such an agenda would directly result in deficit spending. which would increase the already emous federal debt. in good conscience. i can support such an agenda. therefore. often i must tell visitors that i can be supportive of their cherished initiative. as all in this body k. telling constituents that you do  support their project is a difficult job. especially when the reason that i give them is that "the money just isnt there." because they respond by saying. "the money always seems to be there." the problem is that they are right. in a time of war. and deficits. we have approved new tax cuts. which i opposed. we are contemplating permanently extending other tax cuts. which i will oppose. as if that were  egh. we also have added a raft of new spendingincluding the farm bill and the stimulus--which i opposed. there is end in sight. we have gone from record surpluses straight back to deficits. we approved a massive tax cut last year. which limits the amount of money available. we k that the war on terrorism will be very costly. we k we are facing unprecedented demographic changes that will result in staggering costs to sustain social security and medicare. added to all that. we have a $6 trillion debt. which costs $200 billion in interest payments each year. and we practice restraint. we continue to spend money. deepening the hole we are in. this amendment is a step towards reestablishing fiscal discipline in this body. it alone will  ensure the return of balanced budgetsbut it is a step in the right direction. therefore. i urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.
. today i join with senator boxer to introduce a bill to fund the superfund program for the 10 years. with the superfund trust fund on the verge of insolvency and with a large number of superfund sites still requiring cleanup. it is incumbent upon us to provide a stable source of funding for this important program. i am pleased that the bill we introduce today will ensure superfund cleanups will continue without jeopardizing funding for other key programs. the need for the superfund program dates back to the late 1970 and the discovery of thousands of barrels of toxic waste buried illegally in a new york community outside of buffalo. congress responded to love canal and other sites by enacting superfund. this law was intended to address the nations worst sites and ensure that parties are held responsible for the contamination they created. litigation ensued throughout the 1980s. which slowed down the pace of cleanups. by the 1990s. the pace of superfund cleanups increased. administrative and legislative reforms in the last 10 years have significantly improved the effectiveness and pace of the superfund program. collection of excise and income taxes to supply the superfund ceased at the end of 1995 and have never been reinstated. while spending for the superfund program has remained steady. the dependence on general revenue dollars have grown. by fiscal year 2004. the superfund program will be funded virtually entirely by general revenues. unfortunately. we are currently living in an atmosphere of budget deficits. we find ourselves unable to pay for key programs due to insufficient resources and i believe it is a mistake to make the superfund program compete for those limited general revenue dollars because we did  replenish the superfund trust fund. the legislation which we have introduced today will reinstate the superfund taxes for 10 years. it is true that these taxes will generate less revenue than those that expired in 1995. this is a deliberate effort maintain balance between the amount of money paid into the trust fund and the amount.of money appropriated by congress. we do  want to create a situation in which we are putting more money into the trust fund than will be spent. at the same time. we must ensure that superfund cleanups progress as quickly as possible. despite some claims that superfund cleanups will soon be complete. the u.s. environmental protection agency testified recently before the environment and public works committee that the remaining superfund sites are complex and costly. all evidence points to the fact that the superfund program is  in jeopardy of winding down any time soon and that adequate funding will be needed. in conclusion. i would like to say that i believe this to be a reasonable proposal. it is  perfect. because a perfect solution would ensure that the people responsible for the contamination pay to clean it up. in the future we may wish to look for more equitable ways to fund the superfund program. however. with the superfund trust fund on the verge of insolvency. a return to the previous funding mechanism is a prudent step. by mr. craig (for himself. mrs.
. i have been working for the last several months with a bipartisan group of members from the house and senate to protect funding for the state childrens health insurance program. also kn as schip. which provides critical health care to millions of children. in rhode island. over 12.000 children participate in this program. there is strong. bipartisan support for a 2year schip proposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in federal schip funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 or will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. our proposal also establishes a redistribution formula for the centers for medicare and medicaid services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year 2000 funds to those states that have exhausted their allotments and need additional funds. under federal law. cms is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 funds this year. but there is federal requirement on what formula it should use. cms is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 funds because it is awaiting congressional action. however. a few states. including rhode island. need the redistribution of 2000 funds as soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the rest of the year to maintain services to the children currently enrolled in schip. this schip issue is very timesensitive. if we do  remedy this situation soon. some states may scale back schip eligibility because they will assume they will have far less in federal funds available than previously expected. unfortunately. it appears that we can address this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. i appreciate the willingness of the chairman of the finance and budget committees. senators grassley and nickles. to work with us to address this issue in both the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution and then to move this legislation quickly in the finance committee. i also think it is imperative for us to work with cms so that they can move forward to begin to redistribute some of the unspent 2000 funds to states like mine that are facing a serious schip funding problem. as congress moves ahead to complete action on this proposal. cms should move forward on the immediate redistribution of these funds.
included within senate report 107219. and repeated in chairman stevens overview and summary of his amendment to h.j. res. 2. the omnibus appropriations bill. is report language stating the appropriations committees strong support for the clean water for the americas partnership. does the chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee share my expectation that the united states agency for international development (usaid) will fund the clean water for the. americas partnership at $10 million for fiscal year 2003.
i have been working for the last several months with a bipartisan group of members from both the house and senate to protect funding for the schip program. which provides critical health care to millions of our children. in my state. over 12.000 children participate in this program. there is strong. bipartisan support for a 2year schip proposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in federal schip funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 or will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. our proposal also establishes a redistribution formula for the centers for medicare and medicaid services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year 2000 funds to those states that have exhausted their allotments and need additional funds. under federal law. cms is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 funds this year. but there is federal requirement on what formula it is to use. cms is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 funds because it is awaiting congressional action. however. a few states. including my own state of rhode island. need the redistribution of 2000 funds as soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the rest of the year to maintain services to the children currently on schip. this schip issue is very time sensitive. state are beginning to plan their upcoming budgets for fiscal year 2004. which starts july 1 in most states. we do  wantto distort state schip spending decisions by making it impossible for states to plan. in determining how much in federal schip funds they will have and for how long those funds will be available. some states may unnecessarily scale back schip eligibility as a result because they will assume they will have far less in federal funds available than previously expected. it  appears that we can address this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. i appreciate the willingness of the chairman of the finance and budget committees. senators grassley and nickles. to work with me and the other senators involved to address this issue in both the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution and then to .move this legislation quickly in the finance committee. having said this. i think it is imperative for us to work with cms so that they can move forward to begin to distribute some of the unspent 2000 funds to states like mine that are facing a serious schip funding problem. there is a way to move forward to address the immediate redistribution issue of the unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds. cms can redistribute some of the unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds immediately to those states that face shortfalls in the coming months. this can be done administratively. we certainly want cms to begin to redistribute at least some part of these funds to .those states that are relying on this redistribution to maintain their child caseloads. for example. cms could redistribute 100 percent of half of the unexpended funds  leaving the rest to be redistributed once congress has acted on this legislation. as we in congress move ahead to complete action on this full proposal. cms should move forward on the immediate redistribution issue.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller and others today in introducing a bipartisan compromise proposal to extend expiring state childrens health insurance program. schip. funds. i am pleased that we recently secured the commitment of budget chairman nickles to include funding in the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution for this important proposal. as well as the commitment of finance chairman grass" ley to address this issue quickly in the finance committee. this legislation will allow states to continue using $1.2 billion in funds through fiscal year 2004 that were originally allocated for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. and that reverted to the federal treasury on september 30. 2002. this provision extends for one additional year the availability of $1.5 billion in schip funds that are scheduled to expire by the end of fiscal year 2003. this legislation also applies a redistribution formula to the unspent fiscal year 2000 and 2001 allotments. allowing 50 percent of each years unspent money to be retained by states that have  used their entire allotment. with the remaining 50 percent of unspent money being redistributed to states that have spent all of the respective years allotment. this compromise will prevent states from losing their unexpended schip allotments and will allow other states. such as rhode island. to receive redistributed funds they need to continue providing health insurance to children. without this compromise. the result could be a reduction of up to $2.7 billion for childrens health programs throughout the united states. this would undermine the overwhelming success of state schip programs in providing quality health coverage to millions of uninsured children. starting this year. states would have choice but to begin imposing severe enrollment cutbacks. eligible children who are  yet enrolled in the program would continue to go without health insurance. preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that nearly one million children will  lose their health insurance. the office of management and budget recently projected that the number of children insured through schip will fall by 900.000 between fiscal years 2003 and 2006 unless appropriate congressional action is taken to restore the expiringfunds. at a time when our nations uninsured rate continues to climb above 40 million. it makes little sense to take away federal ftnding from states that are desperately trying to find and enroll needy children. this legislation is crucial to many states. including my state of rhode island. without this remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by fiscal year 2004. at 4.5 percent. rhode island currently has the lowest uninsured rate of any state in the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step toward ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance.

. i am pleased to be introducing the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 today. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 closes a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the eligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child support ordersthat of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents who are delinquent in paying their courtordered financial support for their children. under current law. eligibility for the federal tax refund offset program is limited to cases involving mis. parents on public assistance. or adult children who are disabled. custodial parents of adult. disabled children are  assisted under the irs tax refund intercept drogram. and in many cases. they must work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. some of these parents have gone into debt to put their collegeage children through school. the legislation i am introducing today will address this inequity by expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program to cover parents of all children. regardless of whether the child is disabled or a mi. this legislation will  create a cause of action for a custodial parent to seek additional child support. it will merely assist the custodial parent in recovering debt that is owed for a level of child support that was determined by a court. improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that should be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in tile united states. according to the most recent government statistics. there are approximately seventeen million active cases in which a child support order requires a custodial parent to contribute to the support of his or her child. of the almost $25 billion owed in 2001. only $14 billion has been collected. in 1998. only 23 percent of children entitled to child support through our public system received some form of payment. despite federal and state efforts. similar shortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately $88 billion. we can fix this injustice in our federal tax refund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents receive the financial assistance they are owed. while previous administrations have been somewhat successful in using tax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments. more needs to be done. the irs tax refund interception program has only collected onethird of tardy child support payments. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 will remove the current barrier to fulfilling an individuals obligation to pay child support. while helping to provide for the future of our nations children. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be printed in the record.

. i rise today as a proud cosponsor of the amendment offered by the senator from wisconsin. i support this amendment because of my grave concern about our budget deficit. we in congress have an obligation to put and keep this nations fiscal house in order. by passing this tough paygo amendment. we can send a signal that we do  intend to shirk this duty. i think all of the members of the senate k what this amendment does. it simply imposes a budget rule that requires any new tax cuts or entitlement spending to be offset. if offset exists for new tax cuts or entitlement spending. then 60 senators will need to vote to override the rule. in short. this amendment forces congress to make the tough budget choices. there is doubt that we would all like to provide the american people with more tax cuts. many would also like to provide better and more efficient entitlement programs. under the current budget rules. we are  forced to make many. if any. difficult decisions about our priorities. if we want more entitlement spending or tax cuts. we simply provide for them in the budget. that is way to ensure fiscal discipline. i wonder what effect a true paygo rule would have had on our debate regarding the new medicare prescription drug benefit. would congress have thought the new benefit was so important that we were willing to reprioritize and actually pay for it. i have listened to distinguished senators argue against this amendment because the ecoy is showing improvement. but. the fact that aspects of the ecoy are improving does  mean that our federal budget is in good shape. forsaking measures that require budget discipline is the wrong policy. with all due respect. it is the type of thinking that got us into the current problem in the first place. in 1990. congress. which at that time included many of the same senators here today. realized that federal spending was out of control. congressional will to control spending was  egh to put us on the path to fiscal responsibility. so. as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 congress enacted. some tough budget measuresincluding paygo. paygo was extended in 1993 and again in 1997. senators realized then that paygo was a good idea and it was actually working. we went from deficits and red. ink "as far as the eye can see" in 1990 to an actual $236 billion budget surplus in 2000. it is at this point that congress thought the need for budget discipline had ended. so. when paygo expired in 2002. it was  extended. this has led us to the point where we find ourselves today. in 2004. the federal deficit was $412 billion. in 5 short years. we have gone from a $236 billion surplus to a $412 billioni deficit. paygo is  perfect. congress has found. and will continue to find if it is included in this budget. ways to get around it. but. despite its flaws. it does have a proven track record. it tests policies of both parties in the same waypay for your priorities. or find 60 spnators willing to override the rule. this is the way it should be. at a time when our budget is awash in red ink it only makes sense to bring discipline and accountability back to the budget process. if new tax cuts or entitlement spending is so important. shouldnt we be able to find a way to address the costs. including paygo in the budget made sense in the 1990s. when the stock market was at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows. and. it makes sense today.
 bush. i have joined as a cosponsor of this legislation because it will be impossible for us to reduce our national debt and balance the federal budget unless we curb wasteful spending. i have been an advocate for the payasyougo budget rule. which would require congress to pay for any new spending or tax cuts. and will continue to press for its adoption. since chronic deficits add to the burden of debt we are bequeathing to future generations. congressional spending must be reigned in. and i am pleased to support this proposal which is one tool that can improve spending discipline in washington. by mr. durbin (for himself.
i rise today to offer an amendment that moves us closer to hoing the promises we made when we enacted the education for all handicapped children act of 1975 which later became the individuals with disabilities education act or idea. idea has its genesis in the supreme courts decision in brown v. board of education in 1954. as we all k. this decision declared separate but equal is inherently unconstitutional. prior to 1975. it was estimated that 2 million young people either were  receiving any public educational services or the services they were receiving were inadequate. based on the supreme courts decision in brown v. board of education. parents of disabled children sought redress through the courts. in 1972. the district court of the eastern district of pennsylvania in parc v. pennsylvania and the u.s. district court of the district of columbia in mills v. washington. dc board of education applied the principle in brown to the education of disabled children. as a result. states felt compelled to provide educational services to individuals with disabilities and. sought the federal governments help in providing those services. on ember 18. 1975. the house of representatives passed the education for all handicapped children act by a vete of 404 to 7. the senate followed the next day by passing the bill by a vote of 87 to 7. they were over-. whelming majorities. as they should have been. as it was enacted. idea mandated that states provide public education to all children. and it also must provide a free appropriate public education to special needs students. in return. the federal government promised to pay 40 percent of the perpupil expenditures for students with disabilities. unfortunately. we have failed to fulfill our promise to this program. we have made great strides since 1995 when we were contributing just 7.3 percent of the cost. i would like to say a little bit about who pays these costs. there is a lot of talk in this chamber about income taxes and marginal rates and dividend taxes and capital gains taxes. there is  egh talk in this chamber about property taxes and that these special education costs are borne by the property tax payer. . the income taxobviously you pay more the more you make matter what the percentage. the more you make. the more you pay. the less you make. the less you pay. if a streak of bad luck hits and you unfortunately lose your job. you pay less income tax. the same thing with a sales tax. you dont have to buy the deluxe model. whatever it might be. you can buy the ecoy model and pay less sales tax. if you want to buy a cadillac. you pay more sales tax. if you buy a chevrolet. you pay less sales tax. that is your choice. but with property taxes. they are always there. you lose your job. that property tax is always there. and for many people. even if they have paid for that. house. their castle. whatever it might be. their 2bedroom castle. 10bedroom castle. those property taxes are still there. and if an area gets gentrified or increases in value. sometimes those property taxes can soar. so for people on fixed incomes in particular. this is a very difficult tax. especially compared to income and sales taxes. and this idea is borne by the property tax payer. in fiscal year 2005. we were providing 18.5 percentfar from the goal of 40 percent for ideaand last year. we actually regressed. we went down to only 17.8 percent of our promised 40 percent for idea--contributing only 40 percent. we are  to 40 percent of these special education costs which are borne by the property tax payer. essentially. what these percentages mean isthis: for fiscal year 2006. we provided $10.5 billion forpart b grants to states. and our federal share last year should have been $23.8 billionfar. far :away from our goal. in fiscal year 2007. the president has proposed a $100 million increase. our estimated full funding cost is $25.1 billion. under this proposal. we fall further behind. and my amendment would increase funding by $2 billion and have the federal government pay at least half of what was promised or 20 percent. we are only going half of what was promised back in 1975. mf. president. our budget decisions have reallife consequences for our constituents. the burden of the federal governments failure to live up to its promises as i said is borne by these property tax payers. full funding of idea is  a choice for state and local schools. it is a mandate. schools are the largest cost to property tax payers. sometimes as much as 80 percent of the municipal cost is borne by its tax payers. it is usually above 50 percent. for any municipality all across the country. the most rapidly increasing school costs are in special education. listen to this. in th providence. while general school spending has gone up $11 million or 19 percent over the last 5 years. special education has gone up $7.5 million or 74.9 percent in 5 years. and this is typical. that is just one town in rhode island. th providence. ri. general school spending has gone up 19 percent over 5 years. special education has gone up 74 percent. and that is typical. the federal government has an obligation. as we set forth in 1975. to help with these rising costs. that property tax is a tough tax to pay. as we all k. the idea burden on school districts is increasing because the costs are rising the more we learn about childrens disabilities. we are getting better at .diaging. but that is why these costs are increasing so much. . i thank the chairman for his continued leadership on this issue. i also thank senators collins. kohl. coleman. and roberts for their support.
. i call this amendment the property tax relief amendment of 2006. this amendment moves funding of idea to 20 percent of the cost of a municipality. only 20 percent of the promised 40percent goal set in 1975. schools account for the majority of property taxes and special education costs are rising much faster than inilation. if we fund this to 20 percent. it will go right down to the property tax payer. we all k the property tax is one of the most difficult taxes of all we pay. i urge passage of this amendment.

. i am pleased to be joined today by senators graham. lincoln. torricelli. . and kohl in introducing the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001 closes a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the eligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child support orders. that of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents who are delinquent in paying their courtordered financial support for their childrdn. under current law. eligibility for the federal tax refund offset program is limited to cases involving mis. parents on public assistance. or adult children who are disabled. custodial parents of adult. disabled children are  assisted under the irs tax refund intercept program. and in many cases. they must work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. some of these parents have gone into debt to put their collegeage children through school. the legislation we are introducing today will address this inequity by expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program to cover parents of all children. regardless of whether the child is disabled or a mi. this legislation will  create a cause of action for a custodial parent to seek additional child support. in will merely assist the custodial parent in removing debt that is owed for a level of child support that was determined by a court. improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that should be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the united states. according to the most recent government statistics. there are approximately twelve million active cases in which a child support order requires a custodial parent to contribute to the support of his or her child. of the $22 billion owed in 1999. only $12 billion has been collected. in 1998. only 23 percent of children entitled to child support through our public system received some form of payment. despite federal and state efforts. similar shortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately $47 billion. we can fix this injustice in our federal tax refund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents receivethe financial assistance they are owed. while previous administrations have been somewhat successful in using tax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments. more needs to be done. the irs tax refund interception program has only collected onethird of tardy child support payments. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2001 will remove the current barrier to fulfilling an individuals obligation to pay child support. while helping to provide for the future of our nations children. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record.
. i commend senator grassley and senator baucus for their hard work on this tax package. i k they have worked hard to forge a bipartisan tax package and worked hard to make that happen. however. i will join senator carper in offering an amendment which will reduce the size of the tax cut to $1.2 trillion. the reason i join senator carper is i believe there is a whole population forgotten in this tax debate. and that. is the propertytax payer. of course. one of the federal mandates that is the hardest and most onerous on the propertytax payers is the special education costs. the supreme court ruled in the early seventies that all students have to be educated in the public school system. congress acted by passing the individuals with disabilities education act which said we will get the funding up to 40 percent. of course. we have never gotten above 12. 13. 14 percent. and there is a very onerous cost to the communities in property taxes. we are proposing to reduce this to $1.2 trillion which. of course. leaves about $150 billion available for the property tax relief. that should be done on idea. property taxes are the most difficult on communities and on individuals because with an income tax. if ones fortunes decline. one pays less income tax. on a sales tax. if one does do  want to purchase goods. one pays less in sales tax. with a property tax. it is most onerous because it is always there. whether your fortunes decline. lose a job. lose a spouse. the income part of your propertytaxpaying abilities. and also if you become elderly and want to keep your house. of course. that property tax is always there. we are  talking about taxes. we need help for the propertytax payers by leaving money available to give relief in idea. something we promised in the early seventies. passed in 1975. and we have  done it. if we are  doing it with the surpluses we have. we will never do it. a vote for the carperchafee amendment is a vote for property tax relief.
. the central tenet of this bill is reducing the tax cut down to $1.2 trillion. we would devote the other $150 billion towards educational initiatives. how many of us have heard from our constituents about the high cost of the property taxes. the main contribution to these high property taxes is the cost of special education. and that is a federal mandate. let us right  reduce the tax cut and put it towards idea and property tax relief. i urge adbption of the carperchafee property tax relief amendment.
madam president. i would like to take this time to recognize the week of october 2128 as "world population awareness week." rapid population growth and urbanization have become catalysts for many serious environmental problems. they are applying substantial pressures on infrastructure. manifested especially in pollution. transportation. health. sanitation. and public safety problems. these all make urbanization an issue we can afford to ige. cities and urban areas today occupy only two percent of the earths land. but contain half of the worlds population and consume 75 percent of its resources. therefore. it is important for us to recognize the problems associated with rapid population growth and urbanization. gover lincoln almond has proclaimed the week of october 2128 as "world population awareness week" in rhode island. i ask that gover almonds proclamation be printed in the record.
madam president. i rise today in support of the amendment sponsored by senators gregg. feingold. kerry. voiich. mccain. and myself. this is a commonsense amendment that extends existing appropriations caps and payasyougo rules for aher 5 years. in addition. the amendment strengthens some budget enforcement mechanisms. the senators that have spoken before me have done an admirable job of explaining the provisions in the bill. i want to stress the necessity of fiscal discipline. every day constituents and experts talk to me about spending programs that are vitally important to them. asking me to support increased spending. just as often i hear from people who want to do away with some tax. or lower a tax. they all have excellent arguments. and there is much merit to the initiatives they would like me to support. the problem is that if i were to support each of them. i would be supporting an agenda of cutting taxes and increasing spending. such an agenda would directly result in deficit spending. which would increase the already emous federal debt. in good conscience. i can support such an agenda. therefore. often i must tell visitors that i can be supportive of their cherished initiative. as all in this body k. telling constituents that you do  support their project is a difficult job. especially when the reason that i give them is that "the money just isnt there." because they respond by saying. "the money always seems to be there." the problem is that they are right. in a time of war. and deficits. we have approved new tax cuts. which i opposed. we are contemplating permanently extending other tax cuts. which i will oppose. as if that were  egh. we also have added a raft of new spendingincluding the farm bill and the stimulus--which i opposed. there is end in sight. we have gone from record surpluses straight back to deficits. we approved a massive tax cut last year. which limits the amount of money available. we k that the war on terrorism will be very costly. we k we are facing unprecedented demographic changes that will result in staggering costs to sustain social security and medicare. added to all that. we have a $6 trillion debt. which costs $200 billion in interest payments each year. and we practice restraint. we continue to spend money. deepening the hole we are in. this amendment is a step towards reestablishing fiscal discipline in this body. it alone will  ensure the return of balanced budgetsbut it is a step in the right direction. therefore. i urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.
. today i join with senator boxer to introduce a bill to fund the superfund program for the 10 years. with the superfund trust fund on the verge of insolvency and with a large number of superfund sites still requiring cleanup. it is incumbent upon us to provide a stable source of funding for this important program. i am pleased that the bill we introduce today will ensure superfund cleanups will continue without jeopardizing funding for other key programs. the need for the superfund program dates back to the late 1970 and the discovery of thousands of barrels of toxic waste buried illegally in a new york community outside of buffalo. congress responded to love canal and other sites by enacting superfund. this law was intended to address the nations worst sites and ensure that parties are held responsible for the contamination they created. litigation ensued throughout the 1980s. which slowed down the pace of cleanups. by the 1990s. the pace of superfund cleanups increased. administrative and legislative reforms in the last 10 years have significantly improved the effectiveness and pace of the superfund program. collection of excise and income taxes to supply the superfund ceased at the end of 1995 and have never been reinstated. while spending for the superfund program has remained steady. the dependence on general revenue dollars have grown. by fiscal year 2004. the superfund program will be funded virtually entirely by general revenues. unfortunately. we are currently living in an atmosphere of budget deficits. we find ourselves unable to pay for key programs due to insufficient resources and i believe it is a mistake to make the superfund program compete for those limited general revenue dollars because we did  replenish the superfund trust fund. the legislation which we have introduced today will reinstate the superfund taxes for 10 years. it is true that these taxes will generate less revenue than those that expired in 1995. this is a deliberate effort maintain balance between the amount of money paid into the trust fund and the amount.of money appropriated by congress. we do  want to create a situation in which we are putting more money into the trust fund than will be spent. at the same time. we must ensure that superfund cleanups progress as quickly as possible. despite some claims that superfund cleanups will soon be complete. the u.s. environmental protection agency testified recently before the environment and public works committee that the remaining superfund sites are complex and costly. all evidence points to the fact that the superfund program is  in jeopardy of winding down any time soon and that adequate funding will be needed. in conclusion. i would like to say that i believe this to be a reasonable proposal. it is  perfect. because a perfect solution would ensure that the people responsible for the contamination pay to clean it up. in the future we may wish to look for more equitable ways to fund the superfund program. however. with the superfund trust fund on the verge of insolvency. a return to the previous funding mechanism is a prudent step. by mr. craig (for himself. mrs.
. i have been working for the last several months with a bipartisan group of members from the house and senate to protect funding for the state childrens health insurance program. also kn as schip. which provides critical health care to millions of children. in rhode island. over 12.000 children participate in this program. there is strong. bipartisan support for a 2year schip proposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in federal schip funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 or will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. our proposal also establishes a redistribution formula for the centers for medicare and medicaid services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year 2000 funds to those states that have exhausted their allotments and need additional funds. under federal law. cms is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 funds this year. but there is federal requirement on what formula it should use. cms is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 funds because it is awaiting congressional action. however. a few states. including rhode island. need the redistribution of 2000 funds as soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the rest of the year to maintain services to the children currently enrolled in schip. this schip issue is very timesensitive. if we do  remedy this situation soon. some states may scale back schip eligibility because they will assume they will have far less in federal funds available than previously expected. unfortunately. it appears that we can address this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. i appreciate the willingness of the chairman of the finance and budget committees. senators grassley and nickles. to work with us to address this issue in both the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution and then to move this legislation quickly in the finance committee. i also think it is imperative for us to work with cms so that they can move forward to begin to redistribute some of the unspent 2000 funds to states like mine that are facing a serious schip funding problem. as congress moves ahead to complete action on this proposal. cms should move forward on the immediate redistribution of these funds.
included within senate report 107219. and repeated in chairman stevens overview and summary of his amendment to h.j. res. 2. the omnibus appropriations bill. is report language stating the appropriations committees strong support for the clean water for the americas partnership. does the chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee share my expectation that the united states agency for international development (usaid) will fund the clean water for the. americas partnership at $10 million for fiscal year 2003.
i have been working for the last several months with a bipartisan group of members from both the house and senate to protect funding for the schip program. which provides critical health care to millions of our children. in my state. over 12.000 children participate in this program. there is strong. bipartisan support for a 2year schip proposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in federal schip funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 or will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. our proposal also establishes a redistribution formula for the centers for medicare and medicaid services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year 2000 funds to those states that have exhausted their allotments and need additional funds. under federal law. cms is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 funds this year. but there is federal requirement on what formula it is to use. cms is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 funds because it is awaiting congressional action. however. a few states. including my own state of rhode island. need the redistribution of 2000 funds as soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the rest of the year to maintain services to the children currently on schip. this schip issue is very time sensitive. state are beginning to plan their upcoming budgets for fiscal year 2004. which starts july 1 in most states. we do  wantto distort state schip spending decisions by making it impossible for states to plan. in determining how much in federal schip funds they will have and for how long those funds will be available. some states may unnecessarily scale back schip eligibility as a result because they will assume they will have far less in federal funds available than previously expected. it  appears that we can address this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. i appreciate the willingness of the chairman of the finance and budget committees. senators grassley and nickles. to work with me and the other senators involved to address this issue in both the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution and then to .move this legislation quickly in the finance committee. having said this. i think it is imperative for us to work with cms so that they can move forward to begin to distribute some of the unspent 2000 funds to states like mine that are facing a serious schip funding problem. there is a way to move forward to address the immediate redistribution issue of the unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds. cms can redistribute some of the unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds immediately to those states that face shortfalls in the coming months. this can be done administratively. we certainly want cms to begin to redistribute at least some part of these funds to .those states that are relying on this redistribution to maintain their child caseloads. for example. cms could redistribute 100 percent of half of the unexpended funds  leaving the rest to be redistributed once congress has acted on this legislation. as we in congress move ahead to complete action on this full proposal. cms should move forward on the immediate redistribution issue.
. i am pleased to join senator rockefeller and others today in introducing a bipartisan compromise proposal to extend expiring state childrens health insurance program. schip. funds. i am pleased that we recently secured the commitment of budget chairman nickles to include funding in the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution for this important proposal. as well as the commitment of finance chairman grass" ley to address this issue quickly in the finance committee. this legislation will allow states to continue using $1.2 billion in funds through fiscal year 2004 that were originally allocated for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. and that reverted to the federal treasury on september 30. 2002. this provision extends for one additional year the availability of $1.5 billion in schip funds that are scheduled to expire by the end of fiscal year 2003. this legislation also applies a redistribution formula to the unspent fiscal year 2000 and 2001 allotments. allowing 50 percent of each years unspent money to be retained by states that have  used their entire allotment. with the remaining 50 percent of unspent money being redistributed to states that have spent all of the respective years allotment. this compromise will prevent states from losing their unexpended schip allotments and will allow other states. such as rhode island. to receive redistributed funds they need to continue providing health insurance to children. without this compromise. the result could be a reduction of up to $2.7 billion for childrens health programs throughout the united states. this would undermine the overwhelming success of state schip programs in providing quality health coverage to millions of uninsured children. starting this year. states would have choice but to begin imposing severe enrollment cutbacks. eligible children who are  yet enrolled in the program would continue to go without health insurance. preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that nearly one million children will  lose their health insurance. the office of management and budget recently projected that the number of children insured through schip will fall by 900.000 between fiscal years 2003 and 2006 unless appropriate congressional action is taken to restore the expiringfunds. at a time when our nations uninsured rate continues to climb above 40 million. it makes little sense to take away federal ftnding from states that are desperately trying to find and enroll needy children. this legislation is crucial to many states. including my state of rhode island. without this remedy. rhode island is set to run out of schip funds by fiscal year 2004. at 4.5 percent. rhode island currently has the lowest uninsured rate of any state in the nation for children. this bill will enable rhode island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable population. i urge my colleagues to join senator rockefeller and me in supporting this important legislation. it is a crucial step toward ensuring that our nations children will have longterm access to quality health insurance.
. we are debating a bill called the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation tax act of 2003. two years ago this same month. we debated andpassed a bill called the ecoic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001. whatever these bills are called. they add to the deficits.
. i am pleased to be introducing the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 today. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 closes a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the eligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child support ordersthat of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents who are delinquent in paying their courtordered financial support for their children. under current law. eligibility for the federal tax refund offset program is limited to cases involving mis. parents on public assistance. or adult children who are disabled. custodial parents of adult. disabled children are  assisted under the irs tax refund intercept drogram. and in many cases. they must work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. some of these parents have gone into debt to put their collegeage children through school. the legislation i am introducing today will address this inequity by expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program to cover parents of all children. regardless of whether the child is disabled or a mi. this legislation will  create a cause of action for a custodial parent to seek additional child support. it will merely assist the custodial parent in recovering debt that is owed for a level of child support that was determined by a court. improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that should be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in tile united states. according to the most recent government statistics. there are approximately seventeen million active cases in which a child support order requires a custodial parent to contribute to the support of his or her child. of the almost $25 billion owed in 2001. only $14 billion has been collected. in 1998. only 23 percent of children entitled to child support through our public system received some form of payment. despite federal and state efforts. similar shortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately $88 billion. we can fix this injustice in our federal tax refund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents receive the financial assistance they are owed. while previous administrations have been somewhat successful in using tax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments. more needs to be done. the irs tax refund interception program has only collected onethird of tardy child support payments. the child support fairness and tax refund interception act of 2003 will remove the current barrier to fulfilling an individuals obligation to pay child support. while helping to provide for the future of our nations children. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be printed in the record.

. i rise today as a proud cosponsor of the amendment offered by the senator from wisconsin. i support this amendment because of my grave concern about our budget deficit. we in congress have an obligation to put and keep this nations fiscal house in order. by passing this tough paygo amendment. we can send a signal that we do  intend to shirk this duty. i think all of the members of the senate k what this amendment does. it simply imposes a budget rule that requires any new tax cuts or entitlement spending to be offset. if offset exists for new tax cuts or entitlement spending. then 60 senators will need to vote to override the rule. in short. this amendment forces congress to make the tough budget choices. there is doubt that we would all like to provide the american people with more tax cuts. many would also like to provide better and more efficient entitlement programs. under the current budget rules. we are  forced to make many. if any. difficult decisions about our priorities. if we want more entitlement spending or tax cuts. we simply provide for them in the budget. that is way to ensure fiscal discipline. i wonder what effect a true paygo rule would have had on our debate regarding the new medicare prescription drug benefit. would congress have thought the new benefit was so important that we were willing to reprioritize and actually pay for it. i have listened to distinguished senators argue against this amendment because the ecoy is showing improvement. but. the fact that aspects of the ecoy are improving does  mean that our federal budget is in good shape. forsaking measures that require budget discipline is the wrong policy. with all due respect. it is the type of thinking that got us into the current problem in the first place. in 1990. congress. which at that time included many of the same senators here today. realized that federal spending was out of control. congressional will to control spending was  egh to put us on the path to fiscal responsibility. so. as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 congress enacted. some tough budget measuresincluding paygo. paygo was extended in 1993 and again in 1997. senators realized then that paygo was a good idea and it was actually working. we went from deficits and red. ink "as far as the eye can see" in 1990 to an actual $236 billion budget surplus in 2000. it is at this point that congress thought the need for budget discipline had ended. so. when paygo expired in 2002. it was  extended. this has led us to the point where we find ourselves today. in 2004. the federal deficit was $412 billion. in 5 short years. we have gone from a $236 billion surplus to a $412 billioni deficit. paygo is  perfect. congress has found. and will continue to find if it is included in this budget. ways to get around it. but. despite its flaws. it does have a proven track record. it tests policies of both parties in the same waypay for your priorities. or find 60 spnators willing to override the rule. this is the way it should be. at a time when our budget is awash in red ink it only makes sense to bring discipline and accountability back to the budget process. if new tax cuts or entitlement spending is so important. shouldnt we be able to find a way to address the costs. including paygo in the budget made sense in the 1990s. when the stock market was at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows. and. it makes sense today.
 bush. i have joined as a cosponsor of this legislation because it will be impossible for us to reduce our national debt and balance the federal budget unless we curb wasteful spending. i have been an advocate for the payasyougo budget rule. which would require congress to pay for any new spending or tax cuts. and will continue to press for its adoption. since chronic deficits add to the burden of debt we are bequeathing to future generations. congressional spending must be reigned in. and i am pleased to support this proposal which is one tool that can improve spending discipline in washington. by mr. durbin (for himself.
i rise today to offer an amendment that moves us closer to hoing the promises we made when we enacted the education for all handicapped children act of 1975 which later became the individuals with disabilities education act or idea. idea has its genesis in the supreme courts decision in brown v. board of education in 1954. as we all k. this decision declared separate but equal is inherently unconstitutional. prior to 1975. it was estimated that 2 million young people either were  receiving any public educational services or the services they were receiving were inadequate. based on the supreme courts decision in brown v. board of education. parents of disabled children sought redress through the courts. in 1972. the district court of the eastern district of pennsylvania in parc v. pennsylvania and the u.s. district court of the district of columbia in mills v. washington. dc board of education applied the principle in brown to the education of disabled children. as a result. states felt compelled to provide educational services to individuals with disabilities and. sought the federal governments help in providing those services. on ember 18. 1975. the house of representatives passed the education for all handicapped children act by a vete of 404 to 7. the senate followed the next day by passing the bill by a vote of 87 to 7. they were over-. whelming majorities. as they should have been. as it was enacted. idea mandated that states provide public education to all children. and it also must provide a free appropriate public education to special needs students. in return. the federal government promised to pay 40 percent of the perpupil expenditures for students with disabilities. unfortunately. we have failed to fulfill our promise to this program. we have made great strides since 1995 when we were contributing just 7.3 percent of the cost. i would like to say a little bit about who pays these costs. there is a lot of talk in this chamber about income taxes and marginal rates and dividend taxes and capital gains taxes. there is  egh talk in this chamber about property taxes and that these special education costs are borne by the property tax payer. . the income taxobviously you pay more the more you make matter what the percentage. the more you make. the more you pay. the less you make. the less you pay. if a streak of bad luck hits and you unfortunately lose your job. you pay less income tax. the same thing with a sales tax. you dont have to buy the deluxe model. whatever it might be. you can buy the ecoy model and pay less sales tax. if you want to buy a cadillac. you pay more sales tax. if you buy a chevrolet. you pay less sales tax. that is your choice. but with property taxes. they are always there. you lose your job. that property tax is always there. and for many people. even if they have paid for that. house. their castle. whatever it might be. their 2bedroom castle. 10bedroom castle. those property taxes are still there. and if an area gets gentrified or increases in value. sometimes those property taxes can soar. so for people on fixed incomes in particular. this is a very difficult tax. especially compared to income and sales taxes. and this idea is borne by the property tax payer. in fiscal year 2005. we were providing 18.5 percentfar from the goal of 40 percent for ideaand last year. we actually regressed. we went down to only 17.8 percent of our promised 40 percent for idea--contributing only 40 percent. we are  to 40 percent of these special education costs which are borne by the property tax payer. essentially. what these percentages mean isthis: for fiscal year 2006. we provided $10.5 billion forpart b grants to states. and our federal share last year should have been $23.8 billionfar. far :away from our goal. in fiscal year 2007. the president has proposed a $100 million increase. our estimated full funding cost is $25.1 billion. under this proposal. we fall further behind. and my amendment would increase funding by $2 billion and have the federal government pay at least half of what was promised or 20 percent. we are only going half of what was promised back in 1975. mf. president. our budget decisions have reallife consequences for our constituents. the burden of the federal governments failure to live up to its promises as i said is borne by these property tax payers. full funding of idea is  a choice for state and local schools. it is a mandate. schools are the largest cost to property tax payers. sometimes as much as 80 percent of the municipal cost is borne by its tax payers. it is usually above 50 percent. for any municipality all across the country. the most rapidly increasing school costs are in special education. listen to this. in th providence. while general school spending has gone up $11 million or 19 percent over the last 5 years. special education has gone up $7.5 million or 74.9 percent in 5 years. and this is typical. that is just one town in rhode island. th providence. ri. general school spending has gone up 19 percent over 5 years. special education has gone up 74 percent. and that is typical. the federal government has an obligation. as we set forth in 1975. to help with these rising costs. that property tax is a tough tax to pay. as we all k. the idea burden on school districts is increasing because the costs are rising the more we learn about childrens disabilities. we are getting better at .diaging. but that is why these costs are increasing so much. . i thank the chairman for his continued leadership on this issue. i also thank senators collins. kohl. coleman. and roberts for their support.
. i call this amendment the property tax relief amendment of 2006. this amendment moves funding of idea to 20 percent of the cost of a municipality. only 20 percent of the promised 40percent goal set in 1975. schools account for the majority of property taxes and special education costs are rising much faster than inilation. if we fund this to 20 percent. it will go right down to the property tax payer. we all k the property tax is one of the most difficult taxes of all we pay. i urge passage of this amendment.
. i would like to go on record in favor of abolishing the discrimination of the federal 20percent cabaret tax. many of my friends back home are seriously affected by this tax and have called my attention to its inequity. it is recognized with increasing alarm that this tax jeopardizes a basic artmusic. and represents a very real threat to an important part of the cultural heritage of our people. i am told this tax. in existence since world war i. permits less than onethird of the professional musicians in the united states to earn all or part of their livelihood from music. public resistance to this excessive levy has been responsible for closing at least 70 to 80 percent of hotel entertainment rooms throughout the country. the closing of these establishments has resulted in a serious loss of employment to thousands of citizens as well as income to the operators. with resultant loss of revenue to the treasury. all other admission taxes have been reduced to 10 percent. leaving only the cabaret tax at the 20percent level. h. r. 17. the bill before us today. would. through a 50percent reduction in the present cabaret tax. provide for some longdelayed relief. i heartily endorse it as a step in the right direction.
. in this era of heavy federal spending. with taxes absorbing 30 percent of the nations total income. it is more important than ever that we insist on sound. effective mafiagement of government funds. after all the individual citizen is the federal governments primary source of income. when congress considers a budget of nearly $74 billion. as we are today. this is the peoples money. they have a stake in how it is spent. who spends it. and what it is spent for. sometimes we lose sight of this fact. too often we tend to forget the taxpayer once he has paid his taxthe truth is that our responsibility has just begun. this responsibility for seeing that our tax funds are well and wisely spent goes on the whole year through and is especially important in these days of world crisis when our defense capability has been put to a stern challenge by communist achievements. our task is to provide every cent that a steppedup defense program requires. at the same time we must guard against the dangers of further inflation. to do this. we must guarantee a dollars worth of results for every dollar spentin defense and all other federal programs. yet. as i am sure you are aware. there is evidence of waste. duplication. and extravagance in many federal activities. the bipartisan hoover commission. which was created by unanimous action of congress. produced ample proof of the need for strengthening and streamlining our governmental processes. and the commission pointed out that congress lacks the tools it needs to choke off this drain of federal funds. the commission said specifically that federal budgeting procedures are antiquated. cumbersome. and. frankly. leaky. the ecoy drive of 1957 is a good example. you remember how we in congress pared billions from the 1958 fiscal budget. we all thought that these efforts would reduce federal spending.  we k that we failed even to slow down the rate of spending. in fact. at last report government agencies were spending at a rate of nearly $73 billion a year. and that is even more than the administration asked for in the first place. this incredible situation has opened a lot of eyes in washington. the explanation is simple: government agencies were able to continue spending at a high clip because they were holding billions in carryover funds. which is unspent money from previous budgets. . how can that happen. well. under the present system. when a government agency presents plans for a longrange project that takes years to complete. we appropriate in advance all the money needed to pay the entire cost. this is called lumpsum appropriation. once they have the money. the agencies have further obligation to report back to us on the way in which it is being spent. yet in these changing times federal programs are often modified. or even canceled. leaving the unspent funds at the disposal of the agencies. the hoover commission estimated the total of these carryover funds at $70 billion. a sum nearly equal to a full years federal budget. and we have present means of controlling the use of these funds. there is  before us a bill. based on the hoover commissions recommendations. which would place federal budgeting on a more businesslike basis. it provides for what the hoover commission calls annual accrued expenditure budgeting. this bill insures that spending programs would be reviewed once a year and that the government would pay once a year only for the goods and services actually received in that year. it means that congress would automatically receive a full progress report on what has been spent. what we have received for our money. and what it will cost to continue the program. that makes a lot of good sense to me and to many other members of congress who also spend hours digging through old records trying to track down information that should be submitted to us at regular yearly intervals. every housewife ks that she can set up an effective budget if she does  k what the family income is being spent for or how much is tucked away in hiding places around the house. the same thing applies to every office and place of business. if you can keep track of your money. your budget is a waste of effort. that is the predicament of the federal government. our budgeting methods have failed to keep pace with the times. budgeting was a fairly simple task when the government was spending $10 billion or $20 billion yearly. it is anything but simple in these days of tremendous expenditures. moreover. legislative control of the governmental purse strings is one of the fundamental principles of any free. selfgoverning nation. this situation can be corrected right . legislation embodying the provisions of this bill passed unanimously by the senate. the bill has been approved by the house committee on government operations and the house rules committee. it awaits only a vote of the house itself. our responsibility to the taxpayers is obvious. we must pass h. r. 8002.
yesterday i issued a statement relating to the federal tax question as it affected american citizens doing business in the philippines. which was carried by the associated press. i ask unanimos consent that this statewith the consideration of section 251. and also the amendment offered by the senator from mississippi incorporating section 813.
 which speaks for itself. i have received responsive answer to my last letter. dated april 13. 1961. i wish also to include a table from page 623 of the budget which shows the carryover balance in the department of health. education. and welfare. there is carryover in the department of labor.
 kennedy has  seen fit to implement the budget reform act. public law 85759. the last of the fiscal year 1961 appropriation requests have been passed by the house.  one of them contained a white house request that the law be implemented. next year the law is due to expirewithout ever once having been put to the test. the hoover commission. in recommending this annual accrued accounting procedure. estimated that several hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved each year under public law 85759. it is my sincere thinking that the kennedy administration and the congress are derelict in their responsibility if the law is permitted to die without being tested. therefore. i am today introducing legislation to extend for aher 2 years the provisions of public law 85759. i am hopeful that the congress will approve this extension and that the administration will heed the spirit of the law as a mandate of the taxpayers of this nation.
s council of ecoic advisers are on record as feeling that tax relief is essential as a spur to increased productivity and its ally. increased employment. within the last few days senator hubert humphrey. the senate democratic whip. has endorsed a tax cut. i urge my colleagues on the ways and means committee. and i urge the house leadership. to act. this session. on the legislation i am introducing. my bill calls for an immediate reduction of 10 percent in individual income taxes and corporate income taxes. it increases the personal income tax exemption from $600 to $700. i am convinced. and many ecoic experts on both sides of the political fence support this conviction. that enactment of this type of tax measure would really get our country moving again.
 of the united states this year subscribed to the principle of h.r. 4465. when he sent his message on transportation to the congress in april. almost 14 months after the introduction of the sibal measure. as one member of this body. i would like to pay public tribute to congressman sisal for his leadership in this field. his efforts and those of his distinguished colleague. the gentleman from connecticut. congressman seelybrown. have contributed greatly in marshaling congressional support for the repeal of the passenger excise tax which is embodied in h.r. 11879.
. yesterday i introduced for appropriate reference a bill designed to permit employees of educational institutions who administer their own retirement plans the same tax advantages as those who participate in programs administered by the teachers insurance & annuity association. the bill provides that tax exempt organizations who pay retirement benefits will have them considered as annuity payments. such annuity payments will be excludable from gross income under section 403(b) of the internal revenue code. the measure in way alters the present structure or contradicts congressional policy in granting this form of tax relief to profit educational institutions. it merely puts those employees under individual plans on the same footing as those under groupsponsored retirement plans.
. today i am introducing for appropriate reference a bill which would correct an inequity which has existed in the social security system for far too long. the bill would provide for social security coverage of public officers who are paid on a fee basis by the individuals who contract for their services. in my own state of massachusetts. constables. for example. are public officers. but they are employed on a jobbyjob basis and are paid by the people who use their services. therefore. they can qualify for coverage under state retirement plans because they are  paid by the state or local governments. under present law these officers have  been able to qualify for coverage as selfemployed individuals because "public officers" are excluded from the definition of "trade or business" under the social security act. this legislation would amend section 411(c) of the social security act and section 1402(c) of the internal revenue code and make the exclusion of public officers from the "trade or business" definition inapplicable to officers paid on a fee basis by persons other than state or local government. i urge prompt attention to this bill so that public officers operating on a fee basis may be covered by social security long egh to receive benefits when they reach retirement age.
first.  "shall consider the possible adverse effect of the dollar investment under such guarantee upon the balance of payments of the united states" in issuing a guarantee under section 221(b) of the 1961 act. this provision represents aher effort by the committee to insure that american foreign assistance will  unnecessarily weaken our balanceofpayments position. approximately 81 percent of our ecoic assistance funds obligated in fiscal 1963 will be spent in the united states and this percentage is expected to increase in fiscal 1964. . the assistance program has frequently been criticized for waste. inefficiency. and ineffectiveness. . i will  deny that in a shocking number of instances. this has been:the case. this does  call for an end to the program. but rather for continuing efforts to ma.ie it more effective. an informed critic of the foreignaid program. dr. edward c. banfield. has written that "even if aid is only moderately effective in k~eping the underdeveloped countries out of the hands of the communists. it is a small price to pay for a large benefit." .we have already derived tremendous benefits from our foreign assistance efforts. we have seen the devastated nations of western europe rise from recipients of the marshall plan aid to dos of ecoic. technical. and military assistance to all corners of the world. most of these countries. as well as canada. australia. and new zealand. today have their own foreignaid programs. the responsibility  being assumed by these countries indicates the magnitude of the shift in our program. they provided about 40 percent of last years total bilateral ecoic assistance through the development assistance committee of the oecd. we can expect this trend to continue in the future. we can already see the end of a need for certain types of assistance clearly in sight for nations like greece. israel. and free china. a program that has made so much progress toward freedom and independence for the developing nations of the world should be preserved and strengthened. i think this is a bill that deserves the support of every member of congress. independence requires more than the proper political framework. the vitality of a nation is equally dependent upon its ecoic security and cultural development. it is the hope of those who have molded and scrutinized our foreign assistance program that this program will help recipient nations to achieve all three. one way to avoid the euphoria that we have been warned can result from the test ban agreement is to let the people of the united states k that we k that the world struggle is going to continue for some time. even if it is  fought on the battlefield or in space. it will be fought in the povertystricken areas around the world. if we are to win this struggle. we must continue to provide. the developing nations of the world with the tools they need to withstand the seductive promises of the communist world.
the effect of the amendment i have offered would be to reduce from $1.500 million to $1.200 million the authorization for the development loan funds in the fiscal years 1964. 1965. and 1966. this amendment will put our authorization more in line with the demonstrated needs of the program. and will . in my view. impair the effectiveness of our development program. under section 202(a) of the 1961 act. $1.2 billion was authorized for development loans in fiscal 1962. of this amount. $1.112.500.000 was actually appropriated. in fiscal 1963. for which $1.5 billion was authorized. only $975 million was appropriated. the agency for international development has requested only $1.06 billion of its $1.5 billion authorization for fiscal year 1964. thus. over the past 3 years. including 1964. the funds actually appropriated or requested to be appropriated have totaled $1.102.500.000 less than that which was authorized by congress in 1961. under section 202(a) of the 1961 act. the unappropriated portion of the amount authorized for any fiscal year could be appropriated in a subsequent year in addition to the amount already authorized for that year. yet the agency for international development has  included the unexpended amount in its request for appropriations. i do  mean to suggest that aid has been less than alert to its opportunities and responsibilities in the development loan field. during the past 5 years aid has made more than 300 loans totaling about $3.5 billion to countries in various stages of growth and development. as aid has pointed out in its request this year. a number of countries have become practically independent of our assistance. a number of others are moving rapidly toward selfsustaining growth. we can be proud of the part we have played in helping them stabilize their ecoies. seek new avenues of internal development. strengthen the pnvate sectors of their ecoies. and move toward a more favorable position in world markets. while we can be complacent about the progress we have made. we can stop to appraise the present structure of our program and determine whether it is time to make adjustments in our authorizations for such countries. the fact that much of the money authorized for development loans has  been spent does  indicate a decreasing need for ecoic development in many areas of the world. rather it indicates that the character of our program has changed considerably since 1961. it further indicates that we are receiving a far greater degree of cooperation from other free world nations than we have in the past. for example. the development assistance committee of the oecd is  providing about 40 percent of total free world bilateral aid. these developments are extremely heartening. and they coincide with suggestions made by the president. the foreign affairs committee. the clay committee and many other experts in the foreign assistance field. in the light of our own balanceofpayments problems. it seems to me we should cut back our assistance authorizations whenever such action is consistent with our national interest. this is such an occasion. . decreasing our development loan authorizations for fiscal years 1964. 1965. and 1966 will more accurately reflect the demonstrated need for this part of our assistance effort without weakening its effectiveness. i urge the adoption of this amendment.
s efforts to trim government expenses. personnel. and waste received a generous boost this week from the raytheon co.. of lexington. mass. the firm has graciously agreed to provide the government with the details of its reducing plan designed to cut costs and increase efficiency. within the next few weeks. the lexington firm will hold extensive conferences with budget bureau officials and outline the specifics of raytheons plan which has already been extremely successful at the firms plants. this program should be of interest to all of us interested in helping the federal government to do its job better. under unanimous consent. i am inserting an article describing the plan which appeared in the boston globe on february 10 by wilfred c. rodgers. the globes washington correspondent:
 kennedy issued his call for an alliance for progress. surely it is understandable that the stress is on the affirmative achievements of the alliance. they have been many and creditable. and it is  our intention to belittle good works already underway. it is our intention to point out. calmly. a few realities. for in 10 years. or perhaps even less. someone may well be asking. "who lost latin america." the problem with the alliance has  been lack of good intentions. it has been the tendency to claim too much for too little. to foster the impression that it is really big egh to channel the tide of change coursing through the hemisphere. what exactly did mr. kennedy say on that momentous day 3 years ago. he called for a "vast cooperative effort. unparalleled in magnitude and ility of purpose" to meet the "staggering" problems of latin america. specifically. he said: "i propose that the american republics begin on a vast 10year plan for the americas. a plan to transform the 1960s into a historic decade of democratic progress. these 10 years will be the years of maximum progress. maximum effort. the years when the greatest obstacles will be overcome. the years when the need for assistance will be greatest." those were the words. and while money is an inadequate measure of deeds. it does give some indication of priority placed on the alliance in the united states. what is the record. in fiscal 1962. $1.3 billion in total econi aid was committed to the hemisphere. roughly a 20percent increase over expenditures of the previous year. in fiscal 1963. the sum committed was $1.1 billion. an actual diminution in the total. while thus far in the fiscal year ending next june. roughly $500 million has been committed to the alliance. the best measure of the scale is a comparison with the marshall plan. which in 6 years pumped $35 billion in ecoic and military aid into europe. more money$5.9 billionwas spent in ecoic aid the first year of the marshall plan than in the entire 3 years of the alliance. obviously. the comparison is  exact. money could do more in europe because human skills and political framework made it easier to absorb vast injections of capital. but this serves to underscore how much more difficult are the problems posed by the allianceand how inadequate are the resources already committed. thus it can be fairly said that the alliancein this period of maximum effort--has been unparalleled in magnitude. moreover. the aid figures are deceptive. because they conceal the extent to which any net increment in outside aid in latin america has been wiped out by dropping world commodity prices. the hemisphere republics. like other underdeveloped regions. are getting less for the raw materials they produce. and are paying more for the manufactured goods they must buy. between 1950 and 1961. there was a total inflow into latin america of $23 billion in private and public capital. from this must be subtracted $13.4 billion in interest. profits and dividends that flowed out of latin america. in addition. during the same period. the deterioration of terms of trade cost latin america $10.1 billionmeaning that the region was a net loser to the tune of $500 million. these figures were compiled by dr. raul prebisch. the distinguished u.n. ecoist. who has organized the forthcoming conference on world trade at geneva. it is the contention of dr. prebisch. and of other ecoists who have pondered these grim totals. that more than foreign aid is needed to spur development in countries trapped by adverse terms of trade. if the alliance aid is to be meaningful. obviously it must be accompanied by a more radical attack on the commodity p oblem. the matter is dauntingly complex. and we pretend to facile solutions.  is money alone a magic solvent. as mr. kennedy made clear 3 years ago. social reform and ecoic planning are indispensable to the success of the alliance. it would be unthinkable for the united states to squander capital in countries unwilling to take necessary selfhelp measures. what we are saying is that the present scale and conception is only sufficient to raise hopes without p oviding the means to fulfill them. it may be that political realities in congress place implacable restrictions on any expansion of foreign aid or on new approaches to world trade. so be it. but let the administration discuss the program as it isand  as glowing rhetoric depicts it. latin america is the fastest growing region in the world in terms of population. it is driven by nationalist passions. it lies between a world that is dead. and a new world struggling to be born. the alliance. at existing levels. does  provide the leverage for decisive change. if the united states continues at present levels in alliance aid and fails to mount a fresh attack on problems of trade. we must be reconciled to the risks of continued turbulence in latin america. perhaps that is the inescapable pattern. but better to face the unpalatable truths than pretend that a mouse can move a mountain.
 for under secretary of state for ecoic affairs. deputy u.s. coordinator william d. rogers headed the u.s. delegation at the meeting of experts. the quality of the work of both of these men deserves high commendation. certainly. the effectiveness of the u.s. delegation was due in large part to their experienced and effective leadership. the climate of the conference was both positive and optimistic. the meeting saw the launching of a new special development assistance fund. to be operated and supported on a multilateral basis. the statutes of the fund and its first annual budget were approved. a number of participating nations pledged specific contributions. while others stated their intention to pledge specific contributions in the near future. the fund. with a budget of about $9 million will support a number of multilateral alliance activities including technical assistance for planning. technical training programs. public information. and technical assistance for institutional development.
. today we mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the organization of american states. this organization. which has existed for threequarters of a century under various names. is the oldest international organization of this kind in the world. the accomplishments of this organization in terms of hemispheric solidarity and development are legion. today we mark  only the anniversary of an organization but the reaffirmation of our own commitment to latin american nations and peoples. together we can do much to strengthen the ties of loyalty and sol1darity between our nations. but we can also continue our steady progress toward ecoic and social development in the latin american nations. we have made great gains. the partnership of the alliance for progress has resulted in a better standard of living and more of the fruits of modern techogy and science for millions of people already. but much more remains to be done. perhaps the most important lesson of the alliance thus far is the magnitude of the job before us and the necessity for patience in solving the problems that have developed over centuries. as a member of the interamerican subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee. i have been hoed to represent the united states at a number of interparliamentary meetings with latin american legislators. i have developed warm friendships with many of them and feel a personal commitment to hemispheric progress. time and again. i have been struck with the dedication and purpose of these leaders in helping their nations solve their pressing problems. they k. as we k. that while pan american day is an opportunity for commendation of our progress to date. it is also an occasion to take a new look at the structure of hemispheric relations. i was pleased that the new york times and the washington post today took the opportunity to point out possible revisions of the bogotd charter and other measures to bolster freedom in latin america. i would like to call these two editorials. both entitled "the oas at 75" to the attention of my colleagues by inserting them in the congressional record at this point in my remarks:
. i am today introducing legislation to provide for the sharing of certain federal tax revenues with the states. in my judgment. this bill would do much to lighten the emous burden that has been placed on state and local governments in recent decades. the strain of more people demanding more services has pushed state and local tax bases to the limit. in my own state of massachusetts this problem has had a particularly severe impact on property tax rates which have skyrocketed and made industrial growth and the provision of adequate services at the local level extremely difficult. when we look at the figures. we gain a greater appreciation of the magnitude of the problem. in the decade which ended in 1963. school age population increased by 40 percent. while the population as a whole grew by only 19 percent. at the other end of the scale. the number of people 65 or over increased by 35 percent. this situation meant a great burden on citizens during their most productive yearsto the detriment of their own planning for future security. and their ability to provide proper education for their children. all of this population growth and mobility has taken place on an essential fixed tax base. property tax increases have provided 46 percent of increased local revenue. but aher 32 percent has come from consumer taxes of one sort or aher. most of the states. and  many of our major cities have imposed sales taxes. hotel and motel taxes. and other revenue raising devices which in the short run may help meet immediate needs. but in the long run can only hurt their competitive position in the ecoy. despite the increase in federal grantinaid programs. these funds have provided only 16 percent of the additional $35 billion in state and local revenues between 1953 and 1963. the remaining 84 percent came from increased taxes--and increased state and local indebtedness. clearly this is  a healthy situation. and we still can see the end to the number of problems that will continue to face us in the decades ahead. we have only scratched the surface in dealing with problems of air and water pollution. the application of modern techogy to civilian problems. the care and prevention of physical and mental illness. the development of schools of quality and imagination. the provision of adequate recreation facilities. the prevention of crime. and juvenile delinquency. we must  wait until these problems become so acute that we are forced to substitute a crash program for longterm planning. we must develop the means by which to anticipate these needs and provide for them . when we look at the traditional ecoic tools available to policymakers. we find that for one reason or aher all of them are inappropriate to the present circumstances. federal tax reduction to enable the states to increase their own taxes is of dubious value. only a small amount of funds released through tax reduction would end up as state and local revenue. tax credits or the relinquishment of certain federal taxes to the states have serious difficulties. in the first place. the funds would end up in the states from which the bulk of federal revenues originate. thus perpetuating the ecoic imbalance that already exists between many of our states. in the second place many states. those which do  have income taxes for example. would  benefit at all. the proposal to share revenue from a particular tax between the federal and state governments also suffers from the fact that areas of revenue do  always correspond to areas of need. in addition. the repeal of a number of federal excise taxes this year reduces the opportunity for the use of this technique. of course. specific federal grants to states and localities are already in widespread use. but there are a number of problems which do  lend themselves to this method. furthermore. the administrative burdens and necessary federal controls can be burdensome. we must find a method that will ho the principle that the best government is the government closest to the people and assist the states in solving urgent problems. i believe that this legislation reaches this middle ground. it provides for a trust fund of 1 percent of the national aggregate taxable income. present estimates indicate that this would amount to $2.5 billion and expand with the tax base. this money would be available to the states for health. education. and welfare purposes. it could  be used for highways. debt service. general administrative expenses. disaster relief. or state payments in lieu of real property taxes. the fund would be distributed to the states as follows: 80 percent of the total would go to the states in proportion with their tax effort. as compared with the average national tax effort. and their population. tax effort is measured by dividing total state revenues by the total individual income for the state. the remaining 20 percent would go to the 13 states with the lowest per capita income according to population. state could receive more than 12 percent of the total fund. the govers and the secretary of the treasury would be required to provide detailed audits to the congress. furthermore. the state would be required to distribute the funds to local communities according to the proportion of previous distributions. failure of a state to comply with the limited conditions outlined in the act would result in cancellation of the states future payments and allocation of the states funds to the other states. this formula assures flexibility without flabbiness and state responsibility without unwarranted federal restrictions. in my judgment. this is one of the most creative things we can do to insure the ecoic health and effective responsibility of state and local government. the republican govers endorsed such a proposal last summer and i am proud to assist in giving it concrete expression today. of course. we can give this idea proper analysis in the few days that remain in this session. but i think it should receive top priority when we reconvene in january.
. senators have received a number of publications. one of which is entitled. "special analyses: budget of the united states." part v of the special analysis publication. which is kn as "special analysis g." is entitled. "federal education. training. and related programs." it is the first comprehensive analysis of the federal education training and related programs based on data in the annual budget. it covers the fiscal years 1965 to 1967. because of the widespread interest which i k will be felt on the part of many educators in this analysis and. also. in order that senatorial offices may have it available for ready reference. i ask unanimous consent to have "special analysis 0" to which i have referred printed in the record. eliminating therefrom the graphic but  the tabular materials.
. i find myself here in the well of the house again speaking on what i think is the critical issue on this entire bill. and put in focus particularly well by the amendment offered by the gentleman from new jersey. as i said yesterday. the concept of the multiyear authorization is  one which offends me. but i am offended when the committee on foreign affairs and this committee of the whole house on the state of the union is ready to approve an authorization for the fiscal year 1968 when absolutely justification and absolutely testimony as to the propriety of the amount authorized in the committee bill has been presented. i challenge the gentleman from florida. who i see is on his feet. to tell me exactly what the dollars that we have authorized in fiscal year 1968 will be used for and. more important. to cite in the record of the committee. in the committee hearings. any testimony offered by any witness as to the amounts of money needed for the particular account for fiscal year 1968.
. i am convinced that legislation to improve the financial situation in our states is critical. we are all familiar with the problem faced by so many of our states which necessarily are restricted to a property or sales tax base. exceptionally high property taxes only weaken a states competitive position in attracting new industry and new residents. while high sales taxes have a regressive impact on those elements in the ecoy least able to afford them. certainly the burden on state and local programs in my own state of massachusetts would be much eased by the return of $63.5 million as contemplated in my bill. tax sharing would also help us break our present dependence to the grantinaid approach. there are serious questions as to whether this method is efficient. and to what extent federal restrictions impose unnecessary limitations on the decisionmaking process at the state and local level. the taxsharing concept has gained such wide support and interest that i think it deserves our careful consideration during this congress.
. under the bill $150 million would be authorized for fiscal year 1968. $200 million for fiscal 1969. $250 million for fiscal 1970. and $300 million for fiscal 1971. in my judgment this is a modest program that will have an emous impact on the ability of our local communities to improve the quality of water for its homes. business firms. and recreational facilities. i include the text of my bill with my remarks at this point in the record: h.r. 5735 a bill to amend the federal water pollution control act to authorize grants for the maintenance of certain treatment works be it enacted by the senate and house o representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that the federal water pollution control act is amended by inserting after section 8 the following new section:
 of the senate and the speaker of the house except in one important respect. the amendments sent up by the bureau of the budget would provide for an openended authorization for the commission. i think it far wiser to put a dollar limitation on the first 2year funding and have therefore incorporated my original $200.000 2year limit in this legislation. . i hope that it will be possible for the congress to act promptly on this legislation so that more time will be lost in laying the groundwork for a meaningful bicentennial celebration.
. that the department of state conferred its highest award on wayne fredericks on the occasion of his leaving the government. i think it is safe to say that regardless of his everyday responsibilities he will continue to take a lively interest in our relations with the african states. the officials of the african governments. less than the congress. knew that they had a friend in the department of state. for all of these services we owe him a profound debt of gratitude.

. i join with my colleagues who have paid tribute to the memory of the late hoable donald w. nicholson. to express my own deep sorrow over the loss of this former congressman from my own state of massachusetts. although i never had the privilege of serving in the congress with him. i knew him during the days when i served as administrative assistant to senator leverett saltonstall. this outstanding man. the son of a blacksmith. will long be remembered as a dedicated. conscientious public servant. he had the unique and admirable record of having served with great distinction in almost every level of government. he was a selectman in the town of wareham. its assessor. school committeeman. and a member of its board of public welfare. in 1924 he was elected as a state representative and then as state senator in the cape cod and plymouth district. a position in which he came to be highly regarded as a tax and revenue expert. in 1947 he was elected to represent the ninth congressional district of massachusetts in the u.s. house of representatives. and he served in this capacity. with distinction and effectiveness for 12 years. it is with profound sorrow that i join my colleagues in common bereavement over his loss. but it is a great ho. as a member of this body. and a representative from massachusetts. to pay tribute to him . my deepest sympathies are extended to his family and friends.
a bill to establish a national commission on public management. h.r. 69. by ial commission. . i believe that this concurrent resolution offers us an excellent opportunity for channeling our agreement on basic principles and fundamentals into some meaningful. tangible action. the text of the concurrent resolution follows: resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring). findings section 1. (a) the congress finds it absolutely essential to provide itself with a comprehensive means of analyzing and evaluating programs and activities of the united states government in order to ascertain that funds authorized and appropriated by the congress are utilized in the most effective manner and in order that budget priorities may be established. (b) congress further finds that there have been many legislative proposals in this area. among them being proposals for (1) the establishment of an ad hoc. independent. bipartisan commission to study and appraise federal programs and activities and instrumentalities of the executive branch of the united states government. (2) an expansion of the role and function of existing agencies and authorities (such as the general accounting office) within or outside of congress to perform such analyses and evaluations. (3) improved staffing of standing committees of the congress through the addition of review specialists and persons scientifically trained and experienced in the area of program audits and evaluations. (4) and the establishment of a central staff or office as an integral part of the congress charged with the responsibility of performing program audits. evaluations. and analyses under the supervision of a legislative auditor and under the general supervisory control of a joint committee of the congress. as provided by h.r. 11458 (90th congress). (c) the congress further finds that while all of these proposals appear to have merit. a thorough study should be commenced immediately to determine the best method of methods through which the congress can provide itself with the means of scientifically evaluating programs and activities.
. one of our most crucial challenges at this present session of congress is the urgent need to come to grips with the problems of ecoic transition faced by a vital sector of our ecoy. cutbacks in federal spending on defense and space have been predictable for some time. but the failure to prepare for their consequences in an orderly and logical way has resulted in a critical situation which demands immediate attention and effective remedy. in massachusetts alone. over 10.000 highly trained scientists and engineers are presently without jobs. these people represent a vast reservoir of talent and ingenuity. whose preservation and encouragement is vital to our national strategic posture. their plight is thus more than just a humanitarian problem. its alleviation is vital to our very national security over the next 10 to 15 years. it was back in 1963 that i first urged that government and industry begin to prepare for the inevitable results of reduced government spending in the defense and space fields. the following year i introduced legislation to establish a national ecoic conversion commission to study and plan for an orderly and gradual move away from ecoic dependence on military and space contracts. in a speech at theastern university that same year. i pointed out thatwhile reduced levels of spending in these areas pose real problems for our ecoy. by the same token it provides us with the opportunity to make techogical gains we could  have dreamed of earlier. i said 6 years ago: we can and must begin . if we are to realize the emous potential for growth. the past year has witnessed the realization of these early predictions of impending difficulties. it has also been an intensification in our search for solutions. in a letter to mr. george p. shultz on january 19 of this year. i ed some of the initiatives i have taken in cooperation with a group of scientists and engineers in my district to make meaningful progress toward easing the hardships of transition for industries. organizations and individuals hurt by defense and space cutbacks. together. we have explored a wide variety of plans to encourage diversification into areas of expanding national concern. such as purification of the environment. medical research and education. we have worked on projects to provide meaningful jobs in local government. explored possibilities for employment abroad. examined schemes to establish techogy exchanges and encourage venture capital. urged federal agencies to set aside more funds for research. and sought to set up programs for placing unemployed scientists in organizations which are expanding. such as the environmental protection agency. we have also put steps in motion to establish an association of unemployed scientists. engineers and other technically trained people to serve as a clearinghouse for employment possibilities in massachusetts. i have also reintroduced an expanded and revised national ecoic conversion bill in the present congress and discussed the need for more federal action with a wide variety of officials in the executive branch. in this connection. i was encouraged to read in the washington post last monday an article which reported that the administration plans to increase spending on research and development in the new budget. a course which i had urged in my letter to mr. shultz. i deeply hope that the prediction in the article will be borne out. and i look forward to examining the budget carefully to see whether the measures proposed are adequate to the task and responsive to the urgent need for government action. the text of my letter to mr. shultz and the text of the article in the washington post follow:
. said: i strongly encourage and endorse this type of program. for very little money it is beginning to achieve significant results. discontinuing this type of effort. may discourage states and set techogy transfer back significantly. particularly in the less developed states which need it most. nevertheless. appropriations were cut off and the program will pass out of existence at the end of the present fiscal year unless we take strong remedial action. curtailment of the program at the very time we need it the most would be extremely -unfortunate. we do  think this should be allowed to happen. while the state technical services act as originally passed in 1965 was essentially sound and effective. we believe it can be improved in light of the experience gained during its implementation. our bill seeks to accomplish this in several ways. first. we propose to add municipal governments to those who will benefit from the technical services under the act. we are all aware of the staggering problems faced by our cities todayproblems which threaten to overwhelm the municipal authorities trying to cope with them. the benefits of techogy exchangqe and application should  be exclusively directed to business and industry. they should be made available to the municipalities as well so that they can be applied to improving the quality of life in our urban areas and to furthering their econmic development. " . second. experience has shown that those technical services provided under the act which were most effective were field services. and we have accordingly proposedto amend the act to stress their priority. third. we have provided that interstate programs under section 7 of the act be encouraged by raising the ceiling of federal funding for them to 75 rather than 50 percent. .studies of the program have all stressed the value of a regional approach. and the successful operation of the new england technical services program at durham.. n.h.. has shown thesuperior effectiveness of regional organizatiohs. fourth. we have proposed that the program be .funded with authorizations of $30 million for fiscal year 1972. $40 million for fiscal year 1973 and $50 million for fiscal year 1974. studies have shown that the program could easily absorb this level of funding and that the expenditures will pay for themselves by generating additional tax dollars. finally. we have proposed certain changes in the administration of the program by the department of commerce. in accordance with a recommendation in the arthur d. little report. we suggest that the department of commerce establish a management information system which will provide data on program operation. services performed to meet program objectives and the effectiveness of supporting functions. such as accounting. reporting. marketing. personnel and public relations. such a system. to be administered with the assistance of regional offices. would insure efficient operation and improve coordination among the states and between the states and other related federal programs. with these changes. we believe that an essentially sound program can be made even better. we hope that they will answer the objections of those who have had doubts about the program in past years. . we believe that our country needs this program. our industry needs it to ease the process of ecoic conversion. the unemployed need it for the jobs which will be created by techogy transfer. our cities need it to help solve their problems. and the people as a whole need it for the ecoic and social benefits it will provide. the text of the bill follows: h.r. 6976 a bill to amend the state technical services act of 1965 to make municipal governments eligible for technical services under the act. to extend the act through fiscal year 1974. and for other purposes. be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. section 1.

there is one question. which i have about the committee bill. professionals may be employed in public service jobs and receive a salary of up to $12.000 a year. there are a number of .scientists. engineers. and other people of great competence who could contribute to municipal and local government. would it be possible under the committee bill for the municipality. to add to that $12.000 in order to attract these scientists and engineers who might  be able to accept these jobs atthe rate of $12.000 a year.
as a matter of fact. . i do  think the senator from vermont and i are in disagreement as to this aspect of the matter. however. i would point out in that connection the following: suppose that were the case. the state of new york has to pay $161.000.000. according to the figure given here. which. in view of the increased costs which have since occurred. would be a little more than $175.c00.000. so. if we consider the burden on the taxpayers. we would be paying anywhere from $100.000.000 to $150.000.000 more. taking the overall seaway project  under consideration as being the project to which new york state taxpayers would contribute on the basis of 22 cents out of every tax dollar. so when we get all through. i do  think it makes much difference insofar as new york taxpayers are concerned.
i feel that in all fairness it should be pointed out that a very substantial part of that differential by which the tva setup can produce power so much cheaper for its customers than can these other setups and other concerns to which the senators refer. is due to the fact that tva has local tax problem on its hands. from the standpoint of amortization. also. there is a serious question as to how the liquidation of the project has been divided and distributed. there are various and sundry costs involved which apparently are  being included. i am for cheap power. do  get me wrong on that. i am very strongly in favor of cheap power.
. in that connection. i should like to point out that i feel that there has been a misunderstanding. a very honest one. in which the matter of dates is involved. the federal mediation and conciliation service will run out of funds by the end of the fiscal year. it so happens that  of the appropriations committee would be willing to permit me to offer an amendment with the idea that it may be reconciled in conference. in other words. i should like to amend the item to read "$900.000" rather than "$800.c00."
i want to point out that it does  at all answer any argument i have made. as a matter of fact. i insisted in my statement that that is exactly what we would receive. and that is exactly what it would cost us. but in my closing remarks i pointed out that if it comes to a matter of paying taxes. with the tax situation in the country and in the states the way it is. we should much prefer to have our taxes for the purpose in question- paid to the federal government rather than be in a position where we might have to increase our levy in the state itself.
i should like to point out in that connection that i k of state in the union at the present time where aid of this kind is  actually needed. i tried to make that clear in my earlier remarks. because of the present condition of the tax structures in the several states. federal aid of some kind will be helpful to all. this is  a porkbarrel proposition. as long as this type of system has been in existence in the state of new york that charge has never been leveled against it. i refer again to my remarks regarding what i believe to be sound government. and that is that certain states and. when it comes to the states. certain counties. should never be regarded as objects of charity. any aid system which is instituted should be instituted for the benefit of allto be sure. with its cost falling more heavily on some than on othersbut for the benefit of all.
the reason for that . i think. is simply to provide that the states which are unable to reach a minimum educational standard. by means of their own tax structures. shall be assured a minimum. that is the idea behind the formula. in the united states there are a number of statesand we k of themin which the per capita payment for education is several times that in the socalled morewelltodo states. and yet they still are unable to provide the standard of quality of education which is necessary. that does  necessarily mean that the states which can provide more than $50 per pupil. or which perhaps can provide several times $50 per pupil. as the distinguished senator from ohio has pointed out. do  have need for this type of assistance. the educational cost in a state. as we may find it to be in the nation some day. is only one of the costs in the operation of government. to be sure. it is the largest item in most of the states. at the same time it is only one. and there are other costs that keep going up even more rapidly than the cost of education. it is those other costs and matters of that kind that are causing greatest difficulties in at least a portion of the states at the present time. when tapping additional sources of revenue with which to meet climbing overall costs.
i appreciate very much the senators bringing that matter to the attention of the senate. i meant to do so myself. i think it should be pointed out that the year 1946 was a year of high revenue. and that naturally the tax ratio would be comparatively low. in this connection. however. i think it should be quite obvious that very few of the 17 states which i have named would receive the full $5 if the formula were left as -it  is in the bill.
. what is suggested is the sound way of approach. this is the way of approach. insofar as every single appropriation is concerned. with the exception of appropriations to pay interest on the public debt and a few other types of appropriations which. for constitutional or other reasons. can be touched. which can bring our federal budgeting under control and reduce the cost of our federal establishment. i am very glad. indeed. to stand here today in support of the amendment.
i understand. but i should like to point out that they must take out taxes. and we should  pay any attention to that. but there is a problem involved which more definitely reflects the condition of the individual than would any taxes which the individual might pay. interest definitely is a deduction from gross income. the senator says taxes would be paid anyway. so would interest.
the argument which the senator from new york is about to make will indicate that he is approaching the problem strictly from an educational standpoint. there is "gravy train" involved. however. as long as the senator from maryland emphasizes the idea of a "gravy train." if that is what people like to call it. i point out that undoubtedly the state of new york and every other state. including maryland. can find use for the moneys derived from the $5 minimum provision. i congratulate the states which feel that they do  need this money. those states are indeed in a most fortunate and happy condition. so far as the state of new york is concernedand i dare say we are  exactly alone in this matterwe have discovered that we have just about reached our limit from the standpoint of taxation. at the last session of the legislature the state was unable. under the conditions as they existed. to tax sufficiently to meet the requirements of the state budget which was before the legislature. as a result. as i understand it. a shorttime loan had to be agreed upon to meet the situation. that is the fiscal condition of the state of new york. i do  think we are unique in our situation. we can use whatever money we receive by reason of this provision. we can use it very profitably and very effectively from an educational standpoint. but that is  the reason why i favor the bill as it stands. as i have indicated. the taxpayers of new york would actually lose several million dollars by reason of the $5 minimum requirement. the reason i am for the $5 minimum is that from an educational standpointand this is where i definitely and distinctly differ with the senator from marylandit is most necessary that every state in the union. without exception. be a party to the entire program. we have heard a great deal of discussion today on the floor of the senate about the various provisions in the bill. and in the various amendments which were before us. which would perhaps cause the federal government to intrude more and more into the state educational systems. until eventually the federal government might -get complete control of education in the states. i grant that there is that danger in the bill. it can be denied. but. . let me point out  that the greatst safeguard against that danger. the greatest force to offset it. is the participation of every single state in the whole program. i k that all of us will participate from the standpoint of making the contributions through the federal taxes we pay. that goes without saying. that is done by reason of the taxing process. but that does  inform our states. or the educational agencies in our states. as to the conduct of the administration of the educational aid program which may be carried on under federal supervision or federal direction. there is question that in the bill there are definite provisions requiring federal supervision. requiring that certain specifications be met and certain directives be carried out by the states if they are to benefit from the bill. yet. if only a small number of states19. i believewere to derive such benefits. to that lesser extent there would  be the watchdog capacity on the part of the nation as a whole to see that there was federal intrusion within the states in their educational programs. there are 29 states which would  be included if the $5 minimum provision were eliminated. if we eliminate those states from this program. we remove from it many of the states in the union which have some of the best educational departments. that is  saying in any way that the other states do  have excellent educational departments. but if we eliminate from the program 29 states which have excellent educational departments. we take away 29 states which could contribute very materially toward the carrying out of the intent and purpose of the bill. if we should decide to take a course which makes this program a program of charityand that is all it would amount to under the amendment  before usif we should deprive it of the use of one of the chief functions of educationand that is what virtually would be done if we were to go along with the proposed amendmentthe outcome might be that which we definitely do  want. i oppose this amendment  because of any "gravy train" angle.  because under it new york state would be deprived of any financial benefit. dubious as that benefit would be. i do  oppose it for any financial reason. i do  oppose it on the ground that i do  agree with the able senator from maryland when he says that we could save about $100.000.000 by his amendment. technically. we could do so. however. i raise the point that savings could be effected far more satisfactorily by percentage cuts in all appropriation bills. under this bill every state could get along with 5 percent less or even 10 percent less. that has absolutely hing to do with the basic question before us. the safeguarding of education in our states from federal control far transcends in importance the $100.000.000. or whatever the amount of the suggested saving might be. that is what is at stake in this debate. in closing. let me say that if this amendment is adopted. if the bill is passed without the $5 minimum provision. if 29 of our great states can effectively participate in this program. if they can have hing whatever to do in checking what is going on. or in influencing it. then eventually the entire program will prove  only to have been futile. but to have been most damaging to our entire educational structure.
. in answer to that question i would point out that that is one of the chief difficulties with which new york is confronted. there has been so much overlapping in the matter of income taxes. estate and inheritance taxes. stock transfer taxes. and taxes of other types as to which there are duplications. that my states sources of revenue are practically dried up at the present time.
is it  true. the junior senator from new york asks the able senator from rhode island. that virtually every excise tax proposed by the federal government is a specialized sales tax. and that. on that basis. the federal government has for many years adopted the policy of the sales tax as a form of taxation.
the state has option at all in controlling it. the state can only submit a plan which has been adopted by its own legislature. which must meet the terms of the statute. under section 1602and i think. section 1601 of the internal revenue code is also involved to some extentand finally be approved by the federal security agency. in that connection i should like to point out that i have with me all or a substantial number of the regulations which have been worked out controlling this very thing. they have been worked out by the federal security agency. they indicate the great latitude of interpretation which can be placed on the term "other factors in the law."
. the senator from new york would like to ask the able senator from oregon whether he does  realize that under the interpretation of the term "other factors." found in section 1602. subdivision (a) (1). of the internal revenue code. the administrator or the administrating agency could almost wipe outperhaps  completelyexperience rating in any state of the union.
let me inquire whether it is the understanding of the senator from wyoming that the housing expediter. in view of the previous understanding among the conferees. to which the senator has referred. is at liberty to exceed his budget. to go beyond the amount of $17.500.000 to be allowed for the present fiscal year. and that in doing so he may expect that any deficit will be taken care of by a deficiency appropriation.
. my reason for being glad to have the letter read into the record at this point is that it bears out what i have been contending right along. namely. that. while the budget director may himself indicate to the housing expediter that subsequently in the year he may be able to cut month by month the amount of the appropriation he will be using. at the present level required. the amount would. on the basis of the 12 months. greatly exceed the total appropriation of $17.500.000 which has been allowed him. asa matter of fact. it will come nearer $23.000.000. if i have added the figures correctly. if senators iced the closing part of the letter. in which the budget director indicated that he could come to the senatewhich of course would entertain requests for additional or new appropriations for the purposethey will realize that it all goes to show that there is guaranty anywhere along the line that the needed money will be forthcoming from any source whatever. it is all speculation.  let me give the other side of the picture.
i wonder if the distinguished senator from wyoming himself would be willing to go on record at this time as indicating his pledge and willingness to espouse an increase in the appropriation. or a new appropriation when the next session of the eightyfirst congress convenes. assuming that the current appropriation for the present fiscal year proves to be inadequate or will  carry through to the extent desired. would the senator from wyoming be willing to champion a cause of that kind to get an additional appropriation.
the senator has perhaps iced in reading the letter which he received from the budget director that on the basis of the amount allowed between  and october 1. which. as i recall. is $1.900.000 a month. on an annual basis of that kind approximately $23.000.000 would be required. which would be substantially above the $17.500.000 which has been allowed. or even above the $21.667.000 approved by the senate.
the senator from new york would like to ask the senator from illis whether he does  think in all fairness to the able senator from ohio he should point out that at the time the able senator from ohio was promoting such legislation. we had a balanced budget by a large margin.
i merely wish to comment on the very pertinent remark of our distinguished colleague from illis . i hope he will  leave the chamber the other day i had occasion to figure out the total amount of authorizations against which i had voted in the past fiscal year. i discovered that they amounted to more than $10.000.000.000 if my distinguished colleague from illis will watch my voting in this session of congress. he will find that in nearly every instance i shall be voting for the ecoy motion. and for all the amendments which are aimed at ecoy. the point i wish to raise is this: i have added up the figures presented this aftern by our distinguished colleague from minnesota. they come to approximately $573.000 in savings under the ferguson amendment as it applies to the particular items which are covered by the lehman amendment modifying the ferguson amendment. if the figures given me by the distinguished senator from michigan are correct. when he states that approximately $11.700.000.000 in savings are involved in his amendment. only 5 percent of such total saving is involved in the lehman amendment. . for years some of us have been struggling to get an appropriation adequate to take care of the particular items which are covered by the amendment offered by my colleague from new york . year after year an effort has been made to get egh. i am satisfied from what i k that we have  egh yet. the ecoy situation being what it is. we are faced with conditions over which we have control. the position taken by the committee in this respect. when it comes to these particular items. is probably sound. i would  endeavor to upset what the committee has done by trying to increase the appropriations for these items. however. i disagree most heartily with the proposal made by my distinguished colleague from michigan. i think it is altogether out of order so far as these particular activities are concerned. i hope that in the name of ecoy. as well as in the name of humanity. the amendment offered by my colleague from new york will be sustained by the senate. if the senator from michigan were present. i would ask him if he would be willing to accept that amendment. it would in way destroy what he is trying to do. ninetyfive percent of the saving which he is endeavoring to make. assuming that his amendment were adopted. would still be realized if the lehman amendment were also adopted. i urge the senate to vote for the amendment of my colleague.
they are one and the same with respect to purpose. the purpose presumably is to help to reduce the deficit in the post office department and. a the same time. to make the parcelpost system a more adequate instrument with which to serve the people. i am wondering whether the bill will produce that kind of result.
i heard what the senator from south carolina said. the senator said there were mechanical reasons why it could  be done. but it seems to me that by a flat dollar increase the lowest paid workers would receive an increase more in line presumably with what they need. probably the highest paid workers are really less in need of an increase than are the lowest paid workers. the cost of living being what it is. that is why i asked the question.
. i appreciate very much the contribution which the distinguished senator from kansas has made to this subject. i started in concluding my remarks to comment regarding a recommendation which was made on the floor this morning to the effect that it would be possible. after setting a certain reserve figure. say 10 percent. to increase the reserves by adding to them such of the earnings as might remainif there were any earnings at allafter a federal tax had been deducted. i realize that that could be done. but it could be done. very likely. only at the sacrifice of interest paid to depositors. we all k that we can levy almost any kind of tax on savings institutions if we want to do itthat is. any tax which is  confiscatoryand still those institutions can presumably set aside. by degrees. certain amounts for reserves. even though the reserves may be inadequate. but in so doing. were we to go to that extreme. the depositors. the people whose attitude. whose purpose. and whose desire with regard to thrift and savings we want to encourage. would be the ones who would suffer. that is why i would* be opposed to any program or policy of that kind. i again return to my contention that we should  be writing banking legislation of this type in a tax bill. until a thorough study of the subject has been made. or at least until the supervisory officials in the states themselves have been consulted in one way or aher.
this has hing to do with the federal reserve law. it has hing to do with any other banking law. it has to do strictly with a particular revenue act. to provide for certain reserves under a particular revenue act. and it is left to the commissioner to enforce it.
. that sooner or later we must resolve this question one way or aher. it is my understanding that the joint committee on internal revenue taxation is studying this whole pension question. i would ask my distinguished colleague from georgia whether i am wrong in that understanding.
. i appreciate very much what the senator from georgia has just stated. however. i do want to point out. and i am sure the senator from georgia will agree with me. that it seems to be scarcely fair to have a condition in this country wherein certain pensions are exempt from taxation and other pensions are .
. in support of this amendment i should like to bring only three points to the attention of the senate: first. that garnet is vital to national defense. second. that it conforms to the criteria for granting of depletion allowance. and third. that the estimated tax loss is almost negligible. garnet is vitally important from the point of view of national defense. its most strategic use is in the process of grinding optical lenses. it has been estimated that almost 50 percent of all optical lenses manufactured in this country. canada. and free europe combined are fineground with abrasive powders supplied by american garnet mines. moreover. almost 70 percent of the optical lenses used for gun sights. range finders. cameras. periscopes. biulars. and bomb sights are ground with garnet abrasives. in this regard it should be ed that the only other mineral which can be used for quality finegrinding is corundum. however. corundum comes from south africa. whichin time of warwould pose a critical transportation problem. in addition to garnets use in lensegrinding. over 85 percent of all hypodermic syringes manufactured in this country are ground with garnet. the bectondickinson co.-by far the major hypodermic syringe producer in the countryuses garnet exclusively for grinding its syringes. other major industrial uses for garnet are the making of plate glass and the manufacture of coated abrasives. such as sandpaper. plate glass is used in military vehicles. planes and ships. and over onethird of all plate glass made in this country is ground with garnet. coated abrasives also play a vital role in the production of innumerable manufactured items. this brief description of the military uses of garnet clearly documents its critical nature in this time of national emergency. in addition to its critical nature. garnet conforms to the criteria generally established for the granting of depletion allowances. garnet represents a depletable mineral asset. and it is in the national interest to encourage its replacement through discovery of new deposits. most important is the fact that new garnet deposit of acceptable quality has been located for over 20 years. with this in mind. funds must be suppliedthrough thegranting of depletion allowancesfor steppedup exploration projects. i finally. the estimated revenue loss stemming from adoption of this amendment would be less than $25.000 per year. this loss is almost negligible in light of the importance of stimulating discovery of new garnet deposits. * i urge that my. senate colleagues give most serious consideration to the adoption of this amendment and i request the distinguished chairman of the finance committee kindly to accept it in order that it may be taken to conference.
. i wish to point out to my distinguished friend. the senior senator from wyoming. that the amendment  being offered is  an amendment to the bill removing the tax on admissions to movingpicture theaters. that is house bill 157. the amendment which has been offered has been offered to calendar 613. h. r. 4152. to extend the time for exemptioi from income taxes for certain members of the armed forces.
the senator from new york certainly entertains that feeling and he does so without being critical of any person at all. those who are listening to my prepared remarks will observe that they are most charitable. i am praising the pending bill. because i realize it represents the minimum we can do. we must do this. we can afford. in this free world where we are supposed to be the leaders in the matter of freedom. to do less than this. ofttimes we hear stated that the united states has borne the major share of the postwar immigration. acting secretary of state smith pointed out in testimony before the subcommittee on immigration and naturalization that a number of countries have made a substantial contribution in receiving migrants from europe. stating that since 1945 canada has admitted approximately 775.000 immigrants from europe. australia 720.000. latin american countries approximately 125.000 annually. how can we. in good conscience. urge these nations to raise their levels of immigration in the absence of any forthright action on our part. the pending measure authorizes the issuance of 204.000 special quota immigrant visas plus an adjustment of status for 5.000 immigrants in this country. during the 3 fiscal years of 1950. 1951. and 1952. approximately 45 percent. or 208.317. of the authorized quotas were  utilized. so actually the quotas in this bill represent virtually increase in the immigration total allowed under existing law. the consideration of every aspect of the pending legislation demonstrates that its enactment would redound to the overall benefit of the nation. its humanitarianism is obvious. it would contribute immeasurably to the ecoic and political stability of our allies. it would enhance our prestige throughout the world. it would encourage other nations to expand their resettlement programs. and it should strengthen our ecoy through the addition of productive and muchneeded agricultural and other workers. it should return to the federal treasury in taxes paid by these productive members of our society many times the cost of the program. above all. it will demonstrate convincingly to the world what america stands fora symbol of faith and hope for the realization of all those dreams by which men live. . as i close i desire to say that i personally am  satisfied with the pending bill. i do  think it goes far egh. i do  think it is equitable. i expect later during the course of the present debate to offer an amendment which i believe will. if adopted. make the bill more equitable.
 of the united states. i believe the chief executive is quite as much concerned as are we and i feel that we should pass the three coinage bills  on the calendar. they all should stand or fall together. i am  singling out new york in preference to any other state. i think we should pass the three bills and receive an executive determination. either by way of approval or veto. if for reasons which to him may seem sufficient. and for reasons he may desire to express. the chief executive vetoes the bills. it will be perfectly all right with me. but then the two branches of the government will have acted. and we shall have had a complete and final decision. in this connection. on july 30. i made a statement on this subject. which appage 10439 and which i call to the attention of members of the senate. at this point in my remarks i desire to have incorporated in the body of the record the full text of the committee report concerning the bill. which is very brief but which expresses very effectively the ideas which i think many of us have with respect to the need for asking  and then for certain commemorative coins in regard to vital historical events.
. i hope that any objection to the bill will be withdrawn and that there will be objection made to the other two bills of the same character. i feel very strongly that this is a matter of policy. of course. if there are members of the senate who do  approve of this kind of policy. they should  support this pro-. posed legislation. but i do  believe that a senate committee should. as i said before. hold the bag for the other house of congress. if we are going to pass this type of legislation. let us act affirmatively upon the three coinage bills  on the calendar. in the meantime. i suggest that it is very advisable that we establish a system of standards for such coinage. so that the coins will  be of a heterogeneous character. two of the bills call for tercentennial coins. concerning events of 300 years ago. their significance is as important in the history of the nation as would be that of the louisiana purchase coins. the bill for which was passed by the house.
i fully appreciate what the senator from south carolina has said. however. coinage is a little bit different. right  the two houses are required to take joint action. it is  a matter of the senate or the house doing it alone. or for the chief executive to decide alone. are we ourselves to make a decision on this question of policy and are we then going to pass this legislation and send it to the chief executive for executive determination. where it should also rest.
. such action will require inevitably an increase in the national debt. i am wonderingjust wonderinghow many senators. who may vote in favor of this st. lawrence seaway project bill. will vote also in favor of an increase in the national debt limit when that matter may come before us for our approval or rejection.
 in his april 6. 1953. letter to the senior senator from utah . the second title deals with procedural and administrative inequities and injustices which have appeared in the administration of the law. and the third title provides for the pooling of unused quotas and their allocation the next succeeding fiscal year to those on waiting lists of quotas of 7.000 and under.
the tabulation shows that the number of units authorized by the 1949 act was 810.000. there were supposed to be 135.000 units a year for a 6year period. the number of units built up to april 30. 1954. was 146.000. the number of units under construction. or contracted for construction. was 59.000. added to those figures is aher one which shows the number of units eligible for construction for the fiscal year 1955 to be a total of 33.000. which leaves a balance. under the original authorization. of 572.000.
. i wish to take this opportunity to speak briefly in connection with the statement of the senator from florida. perhaps i have had more to do than has any other member of the senate with the question of discrimination. especially discrimination in employment. we have had a struggle in new york state to secure the enactment of a law to that effect. strange as it may seem to members of the senate. we had just as much opposition in having such a law enacted in new york state as we are having in securing the passage of the civilrights bill. i k there is prejudice. i k there is discrimination. i never made any bones about it. we all k there is both. what we are trying to do is to overcome the obstacles. gradually and by degrees. we are doing so. i want to say to my friend from florida that the law we have in new york state. far from hurting. is helping tremendously. if there are any southern teachers of the colored race in new york who are  getting jobs. it is  because of their race or color. such discrimination would be prohibited by the laws of the state of new york. it could  possibly occur. the only reason they are  getting the jobs is that they do  conform in some way with the standards of the state or city. i do  k what the reason is. we are struggling with the problem. i am  condemning the south or any other section of the country. we have to work together. the way we are working. i think we will get somewhere. while i am on the subject. i should like to say something about the civilrights bill. on which i understand some kind of an agreement has been reached. i have been rather caustic about the bill. because. comparatively speaking. it does  amount to very much. but in the long run. it is a step a tiny step. but a real stepin the right direction. as it is being amended in the report we are to get from the house from conferees. because the bill is  in conference. the report from those who have consulted on the bill is that they are agreed the bill will be in satisfactory form when the senate gets it. i intend to vote for the bill because it is a step. we must try to solve the problem by degrees. we can do it simultaneously and all at once. it can be done that way. we have got to have patience.
in the first place. i should like to ask the distinguished senator from massachusetts a question. is it  a fact that all of the information which is possessed by the internal revenue service is confidential and  open to public inspection.
the senator from montana objected when the bill was first reached on the calendar. asking for an explanation. i was necessarily absent and was  here to make the explanation. since then he and i have gone over the report on the bill. and the senator stated in open senate just before he left the chamber that he had further objection. in a word. this bill meets a decision of the attorney general to the effect that a reserve officer  on active duty is nevertheless a person holding an office of trust or profit under the united states. and therefore is ineligible. if he is a lawyer. to appear in an argument before the treasury department or to argue a tax case. of course. ody ever dreamed that a reserve officer should be crippled from pursuing his ordinary peacetime vocation when he was  on active duty. and if the decision were insisted on and applied in parallel cases. it would force the retirement from the reserve corps of a large number of valuable. useful officers. therefore the committee was unanimous in reporting the bill.
. i favor the tax credit approach over the outright deduction for educational expenses. by adopting the credit plan. each individual paying a given amount in tuition and fees would receive the same tax benefit in dollars regardless of his income tax bracket. an outright deduction of educational expenses would be of benefit to more than 37 million taxpayers who elect to use the tax tables or take the statutory standard deductions. instead of itemizing their deductions to reduce their taxes. by the use of a credit. however. these taxpayers will be in a position to avail themselves of the benefit of the educational tax credit in their returns and also use the tax tables or standard deduction in the computation of their tax liability. our children represent the future of our nation. it is my hope the congress will give this bill favorable consideration. thereby encouraging the pursuit of higher education by a greater number of americans.
as i understand the legislation pending before us today. it extends the life of the tax and. in particular. it puts into law the authority the president  has as a result of the gore amendment and brings down the authority from 3 years to 1 year with respect to debt obligations.
. i compliment most warmly the gentleman for his remarks and associate myself with him in his remarks. i would ask one question of the gentleman. does  this tax seriously risk the loss of the capital markets and the preeminence of the united states in that field of capital markets and the loss of them to europe.
. it has been some 10 years since the last overall review of the executive branch by congress. as a member of the government operations committee and as a former staff member of the first hoover commission. i am particularly aware of great changes in the size. emphasis. and complexity of government since the second hoover commission that point to the need for aher study of the operations of.the executive branch. i am happy to cosponsor the legislation to this end introduced today by my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from maryland . although congressional scrutiny of the executive branch is continual. there is a definite need for a comprehensive study with a broad congressional mandate and widespread public support. this need is underscored by developments at home and abroad. the number of new federal programs established within the last 10 years is unprecedented since the days of the new deal. running the gamut from funds for space research to a war on poverty. this proliferation of government activities indicates a clear need to take a hard look at the whole structure of fiscal management. last year i introduced legislation calling for a fresh study of the legislative budget process provided for in the legislative reorganization act of 1946 which would encourage an overall rather than a piecemeal approach to appropriations and the raising of revenues. a similar study of the executive budget process is also required if we are to have a clear understanding of what is essential as opposed to what is merely desirable. and if we are to establish a system of priorities among proposed programs. on the foreign scene. our worldwide responsibilities and commitments have considerably enlarged since the last hoover commission. as a former ambassador. it is my judgment that it is a matter of some importance to see whether our existing structure of government can deal effectively with our opportunities and responsibilities. in our nuclear age it is essential that we have new and more effective machinery to identify and get ahead of emerging problems before they become crises with limited and narrowing options. leading toward potential confrontation. today. the cabinet is overbalanced in favor of domestic departments. and it is a real question as to whether the white house and the cabinet are so established as to give effect to our major responsibility as leader of the free world.
. i am introducing today a bill which would establish a workable program for the sharing of federal tax revenues with the states. this legislation has been introduced in the other body by the distinguished senior senator from new york.
. i rise in strong support of the motion to recommit. because it is clear that the action that the house might take would be irresponsible. it is a case of the administration borrowing outside. the budget at interest rates at leastthreefourths of 1 percent above interest paid on tried and true treasury borrowing instruments. it is a clear instance of failing to face hard decisions.
. news reports just last week as schools opened around the country indicated that there will be a serious shortage of teachers in many communities this fall. the elementary and secondary education act. the higher education act and the other educational assistance measures that this congress has enacted all require as the backbone of the their success good teachers in increased numbers to meet the needs of our expanding classrooms. but sheer numbers do  indicate that the greatest need of all is for highly trained teachers who will concentrate on teaching and on their students. a 32state survey by the national education association in 196465 indicated that only 65.8 percent of the teachers had bachelors degrees and only 18.3 percent had masters degrees. an incentive such as continuation of the tax relief that my bill would provide will do much to encourage our teachers to refresh their skills. to catch up on new methods and techniques. and to increase their understanding of their children and their subjects. good teachers are one of this nations most important needs in order to attain educational excellence. the congress must do what it can to strongly encourage those in the teaching profession. and i am hopeful that prompt action will be forthcoming on this legislation.
 referred in his message. it will require large sums of moneyto supplement state taxing powers that are  being used to their fullest extentavailable through a welldesigned program of federalstate revenue sharing. the need for more financial asistance to the states is clear: the total debt outstanding for state and local governments in the past decade increased 125 percent while the federal debt increased only 14 percent. at the same time. state and local taxes has risen about as high as they can go with the increase in revenue at these levels from $23.6 billion in 1955 to $51.6 billion in 1965. however. additional aid from the federal government should come in the form of a share of federal tax revenues with a minimum of restrictionsrather than as an increasing number of grantinaid programs with the accompanying federal presence in the decisionmaking process at the state and local levels. one of the principal features of the javitsreed taxsharing plan is the relative freedom the states and municipalities will enjoy in the use of these funds. a state allotment may be used for programs. projects. and servicesincluding capital expenditures--in the general areas of health. education. and welfare. in addition. each state may use up to 5 percent of its allotment to provide for planning. research. and development in the modernization of the institutions of state government and the improvement of governmental procedures. funds may  be used. however. for administrative expenses for state and local governments. highway programs. state payments in lieu of property taxes. debt service. and disaster relief. to insure that states will share their allotments equitably with local governments. the gover of each state will be required to submit a distribution plan at the beginning of each fiscal year. following consultations with local officials. the plan would detail how the state proposed to share its funds with local governments. the primary features of the taxsharing plan are: first. a trust fund would be established in the treasury department into which an amount equaling 1 percent of the aggregate taxable income reported on individual income tax returns would be appropriated starting on july 1. 1968. the fund would increase to 11/2 percent of aggregate taxable income starting july 1. 1969. and to 2 percent of aggregate taxable income starting july 1. 1970. and thereafter. using current data this would total $3 billion. it would grow as the fund increased and as the tax base expanded. second. payments to the states from the trust fund would be made on the basis of the following formula: 85 percent would be distributed on the basis of population. this amount would be increased or decreased depending on a states own tax effort relative to that of other states. which would be measured by a "revenue effort ratio" for each state. this is obtained by dividing the total revenues collected by the state and its political subdivisions by the total income of individuals residing in the state. the states revenue effort ratio is then compared to the average ratio for all states by dividing the states ratio by the average. 15 percent would be distributed to those states with per capita personal incomes below the average for all the states. the per capita income for each of these states is subtracted from the average of all states. the difference between these figures is then used to compute each states share of the fund. third. state could receive a total payment for any one fiscal year in excess of 12 percent of the trust fund for that year. fourth. to participate in the plan. a state will be required to file reports with the secretary of the treasury. the comptroller general. and the appropriate committees of congress. including a statement of intent as to how and for what purposes it shall spend the money. states would also have to comply with all applicable laws including title vi of the civil rights act of 1964. the secretary of the treasury will be required to file with the congress an annual audit report on the operation of the fund during the preceding fiscal year and its expected operation in the next year. fifth. appropriations committees of both houses and the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee would be required at least once each congress to conduct a complete survey of the operation of the trust fund and provide such legislative recommendations as may be appropriate.
. i am introducing today a bill to provide that the united states shall reimburse the states and their political subdivisions for real property taxes  collected on real property owned by a foreign government and therefore exempt from taxation. many municipalities. especially those surrounding new york city. are the proud hosts of a number of diplomats representing their governments at the united nations. at the same time. however. these cities are forced to assume the burden for unpaid taxes that rightfully should be shared by the entire nation. in my own congressional district. for example. the city of new rochelle has property occupied by the ambassadors of four foreign governments accredited to the u.n. which has an assessed value of approximately $300.000. resulting in unpaid taxes of about $150.000. with tightened municipal budgets and rising tax rates. it is my judgment that the entire country should share the increased tax burden placed on the residents of these affected cities.
 stated in his recent message to the congress. the congress first recognized this need in 1965 with the unanimous passage of the older americans act. which declared that it is the responsibility of government at all levels to assist these citizens to achieve full and free enjoyment of their later years. the act focused on three basic areas. first. it created the administration on aging to serve as the coordinatink unit within the federal government in all matters of concern to older people. among its other responsibilities. the administration on aging carries out two grant programs authorized by the act. title iii provides funds to the states for community planning. services. and training in accordance with a state plan that is administered by a state agency whose sole responsibility is to administer this plan and whose concern is improving the lives of senior citizens. some 51 states and territories  have such agencies and some 43 plans have been approved. it is expected that community programs under this title will total 800 to 1.100 by the end of this fiscal year. the third major thrust of the older americans act is the grant program authorized by titles iv and v to provide direct grants to conduct research into problems of the aged and to develop new techniques for meeting these problems. and to support specialized training programs for persons working with the aged. by the end of 1966. 39 grants had been made to institutions in 25 states under these titles. the bill i am introducing would extend the grant provisions of this act through 1972. further. authorizations for fiscal year 1968 are made in the amounts of $10.550.000 for grants to the states and $6.400.000 for research. demonstration. and training direct project grants. as well as such sums as may be necessary for the next 4 fiscal years. the increased funding is expected to support 240 to 300 new programs by the states and an additional 70 to 80 new research projects. one such research program that is contemplated by the administration on aging is the development of nutritional services that meet the needs of senior citizens. . identical bills have been introduced by the chairman of the education and labor committee.  of the senate special committee on aging. senator harrison williams. in the 2 years that this legislation has been in force. considerable progress has been made in reaching senior citizens in their home communities who can benefit most from these programs. the extensions and revisions contemplated by my bill are important in sustaining this effort on the federal. state. and local levels.
 for fiscal year 1968. the enrollment of the teacher corps could be increased to 6.000. . this is a creative and farsighted program that we can permit to wither away for lack of adequate financing. it is a unique approach to meeting the special educational needs of the disadvantaged childan approach that has proven itself successful even on this limited scale. it would be a serious omission to fail to provide this supplemental appropriation of $12.5 million  and the full authorization for fiscal year 1968 that is necessary if the teacher corps is to recruit and train new members. as well as permit present corpsmen to make plans for the coming academic year.
i shall be happy to put them in the record. this table. which was prepared by the office of education. compares state allotments for fiscal year 1969. assuming the full authorization of $3 billion requested in the substitute amendments and the "floor" provision. under which state would receive less money in years subsequent to fiscal year 1968 than it did in fiscal year 1968. that is column 1. the figures listed in column 2 are based on the committee bill authorization of $3.3 billion prorated down to $3 billion with a "floor" provisionso we are comparing equal authorizationsand the formula which utilizes a lowincome factor of $3.000 and the state or national average per pupil expenditure. whichever is higher. figures for fiscal year 1969 are used since that is the first year in which the "block grant" amendments of the substitute would take effect. comparison of amounts under h.r. 8983. as amended and public law 8910. title i. ii. iii. and v. fiscal year 1969 [public law 8910 authorization prorated to $3.000.000.000] quie bill. h.r. 8983 1 public law 8910 2 united states and outlying areas ---------------------- $3.000.000.000 $3.000.000.000 ---------------00 states and the district of colum bia -----------------------a lab m a --------------....... alaska ........................ arizona ----------------------a rkansas ----------------------california --------------------colorado ----------------------connecticut ------------------delaware ..................... florida ........................ georgia ------------_------h aw aii ------------------------id aho -------------------------illis ........................ indiana -----------------------iow a --------------------------kansas ........................ kentucky ..................... louisiana ---------------------m aine ------------------------m aryland ---------------------m assachusetts ----------------m ichigan ---------------------m innesota ..................... mississippl .................. m issouri ----------------------2.910.178. 424 74.835.472 4.105. 255 30.223.631 39.010.766 205.710.592 31.705.347 28. 043.253 6.377.716 88.422.327 87.889.065 11. 648. 807 14. 066. 153 119.238.436 75. 92. 924 44. 103.870 35. 064.616 62. 829. 289 79. 379. 838 17. 437. 311 50.895.492 60. 618. 256 132. 246. 570 61. 257.823 51.910.849 63. 973. 446 2.904.208.181 97.332.522 5.110.397 23. 38.957 60.038.077 190.939. 082 24.694.197 24.547.775 6.422.093 86. 200.051 107.823.323 7.715.697 9. 580. 495 116.733.381 51. 177. 332 40.986.002 27. 595. 918 79. 832. 201 89. 236. 606 13. 489. 566 39. 516. 176 45.650.273 87.334.294 53.825. 906 90.736.660 66. 573. 562 net gain or loss (col. 2 minus col. i) -$22. 497. 050 -1.005.142 +6.684.674 -21.027.311 +14.772.510 +7.011.150 +3.495.478 -43.377 +2.222.276 -19.934.258 +3. 933.110 +4. 485. 158 +2. 505. 055 +24. 751. 592 +3. 117. 868 +7. 468. 698 -17.002. 912 -10. 856. 768 +3. 947. 745 +11.379.000 +14.967. 983 +44. 912. 276 +7.431.917 -38.825.811 -. 600.116 50 states and the district of columbiacontinued m ontana ----------------------n ebraska ...................... n evada -----------------------new hampshire ............. new jersey ................... new mexico --------------new york ................ th carolina ---------------n orth dakota -----------------o hio ............. oklahona .................... oregon ....................... pennsylvania ................ rhode island ................ south carolina ............... south dakota ................. tennessee ..................... texas ......................... utah .......................... vermont ...................... v irginia ---------------......... w ashington ------ ... ...... west virginia ................ wisconsin ..................... wyoming ..................... district of columbia ----------outlying areas ----------------$3 000 000 000 distributed with 3 percent withheld for the outlying areas and the balance distributed on the state products of (1) ndea allotment ratios. fiscal year 1968 and fiscal year 1969 and (2) estimated 517 population. july 1. 1965. with "floor" of public law 8910 fiscal year 1968 estimated allotments. . public law 8910 authorization of $3.290.467.883 for titles i. ii. iii. and v. fiscal year 1969 (ol. 2 of table 1. april 4. 1967). prorated to $3.000.000.000. with "floor. $3.000 lowincome factor. . he continues: while it is  clear how much of the reduction would be borne-
. to coordinate the proliferation of federal programs serving senior citizens. some 18 or 19 agencies affect senior citizens through a variety of concerns. including the foster grandparents program of the office of ecoic opportunity. the job training programs available through the vocational rehabilitation administration. and the many forms of assistance offered by the departments of labor. health. education. and welfare. housing and urban development. and the social security administration. second. among its other responsibilities. the administration on aging carries out three grant programs authorized by the act. the most important of these is title iii which provides funds to the states for community planning. services. and training in accordance with a state plan that is administered by a state agency whose sole responsibility is to administer this plan and whose concern is improving the lives of senior citizens. some 51 states and territories  have such agencies and some 43 state june .19. 1967 plans have been approved. with 432 community programs  underway and an additional 150 pending. it is expected that community programs under this title will total between 800 and 1.000 by the end of this fiscal year. the third major concern of the older americans act are the grant programs authorized by title ivto provide direct grants to conduct research into problems of the aged and to develop new techniques for meeting those problemsand title vto support specialized training programs for persons working with the aged. by the end of 1966. 39 grants had been made to institutions in 25 states under these titles. the bill before us today would extend the grant provisions of this act through further. authorizations for fiscal year 1968 are made in the amounts of $10.550.000 for grants to states and $6.400.000 for research. demonstration. and training direct project grants as well as such sums as may be necessary for the next 4 fiscal years. the increased funding is expected to support 240 to 300 new programs by the states and an additional 70 to 80 new research and training projects. one such research program that is contemplated by the administration on aging is the development of nutritional services that meet the needs of senior citizens.
in regard to the point the gentleman is making. i am informed that missions have been scheduled or defined in the apollo applications program. i think there is a clear case here for a cut in essential spending. i might add that part of the appropriations. according to page 55 of the hearings. is $57 million for production of updated saturn followon boosters that will  be required until 1973 and 1974. in addition. the budget for the apollo applications program includes the following other items. most of which indicate the limited definition of the program to date: $23 million to universities for definition of experiments. $80 million for spacecraft modifications. $69 million for an orbital workshop. $55 million for a manned telescope. $20 million for longleadtime items for saturn v. and $35 million for support. certainly. this is an area in which we could reduce expenditures at this time.
i would commend the gentleman for offering this amendment. it is totally in line with the unanimous recommendation of the subcommittee. it is true that there are some $7 million in funds that reportedly represent united states dollar refund claims on which we have been seeking satisfaction. i think an escrow account is proper. as the gentleman may recall. we have an escrow account in laos and it serves the administrative and fiscal necessities there very well.
. i rise in strong support of the library services and construction act amendments of 1967. h.r. 13048. although the several amendments proposed in this legislation are relatively mi and of a technical nature. they reaffirm our support of this important educational endeavor. almost 27 million books and library materials were purchased under state plan programs with federal. state. and local funds since the inception of the library services program in 1957. in addition. significant construction of 719 new library facilities has been undertaken both in rural and urban areas. public library service was extended for the first time to 13 million americans. and 75 million people received new or improved service. in my own state of new york. progress has been commendable. the state has received some $10.7 million in federal funds. this money has assisted with the establishment of some 14 additional library systems in the state. so that there are  22 library systems encompassing all 62 counties and serving over 98 percent of the states population. new yorks deputy commissioner of education reported that: in the 10 years since the passage of the library services act. there has been an almost total transformation of new yorks public library landscape. it is the result of an uncomomnly common effort by local. state and federal agencies to achieve the goals of modern library service in the face of conditions of environment that are changing at a rate faster than in any previous time in history. because the world and the conditions in which we live are changing so rapidly. it is even more important today than ever before that we make available the materials and the facilities our citizens need to read about the past. to understand the present and to realize better the future. our efforts to assist education are less than wholehearted unless we also encourage and promote reading. a love of scholarship and a respect for the great writings of othersunless we bring to the children of the ghetto a broader horizon. as amended in 1966. the library services and construction act consists of four titles. title i provides matching funds for acquisition of books and other materials. equipment. salaries. and other operating expenses. title ii authorizes matching funds for public library construction as part of the state plan. new last year. title iii provides money for the establishment and maintenance of cooperative networks of libraries at local. state. regional. or interstate levels. part a of title iv makes available funds for a program of state institutional library services for penal institutions. orphanages. hospitals. and so forth. finally. part b of title iv provides a program of library services to the handicapped. . the legislation passed last year authorized funds for these programs through 1971. the measure before us today includes a number of simple amendments that will improve the quality of services available under the act. the first amendment corrects what appears to have been an oversight in early legislation so that the trust territory of the pacific islands will be eligible for 100 percent federal financing under all grant titles of the act. the virgin islands and samoa are already covered specifically under the act. second. the base year for measuring state maintenance of effort requirements under the program of state institutional library services is changed from the preceding fiscal year to the second preceding fiscal year. this will enable more realistic planning as states can supply expenditure data before the end of a fiscal period and their annual programs must be submitted prior to that date. the third amendment would give state library administrative agencies the authority to acquire used buildings for reation into suitable library facilities. this amendment broadens the definition of "construction" as presently in title ii to include the necessary authority to alter existing structures. the final major series of amendments would extend 100percent federal financing for a second fiscal year to programs under titles iii and iva and ivbinterlibrary cooperation. state institutional library services. and library services for the handicapped. fiscal year 1967 was the initial year of these programs and the federal contribution for that period was fixed at 100 percent. however. appropriations for these titles were made only in april of 1967 and the very limited sums available were only for planning. thus. fiscal year 1968 will. hopefully. be the first year of real operation for these three important programs. and this amendment would allow the states the benefit of the 100percent federal financing that they were  able to utilize last year. this change. i believe. is essential and important to carry out the intent of the congress. i should like to stress that the legislation before us today makes authorizations or appropriations. the library services and construction act amendments of 1966 made authorizations for fiscal years 1967 through 1971. these total $275 million for title ilibrary services. $300 million for title iiconstruction. $50 million for title ilinterlibrary cooperation. $50 million for title ivastate institutional library services. and $25 million for title ivblibrary services for the handicapped. members may also be interested in funds expended for this program prior to its expansion in 1964. from 1957 through 1964. when the act covered only library services for rural areas. a total of $60 million was authorized. in 1965 funds were also made available to urban areas and title ii. dealing with library construction. was added. authorizations in 1965 and 1966 totaled $50 million for rural and urban library services and $60 million for rural and urban library construction. although h.r. 13048 is  the appropriate legislation in which to make these changes. i think it is useful to point out at this time that the appropriations request for all titles of the library services and construction act for fiscal year 1968 is less than half of the amount authorized. the request totals $68 million while authorizations were made in the amount of $114 million. in the last fiscal year appropriations were only $12 million less than the authorizations. i believe that this is a most unfortunate example of the upsidedown priorities that have characterized the budget requests in some of our most meaningful and most urgent domestic programs. nevertheless. by passing the library services and construction act amendments of 1967 today. we will be reaffirming our commitment to the effective partnership between federal. state. and local governments in providing progressive and muchneeded library services and facilities for all americans.
in response to the gentleman. it is my understanding that this just changes two titles. titles iii and iv. to recapitulate on the matching formula. under the present statute. titles i and ii. the federal share could  exceed 66 percent. or fall below 33 /3 percent. in titles iii and iv the federal share is 50 percent. except in fiscal year 1967. and. as amended today. the federal share for these two titles is 100 percent for fiscal 1968 as well.
i would say to the gentleman that i have discussed this very point with the office of ecoic opportunity. they tell me that there is  a clear waiver in the present language. and that the waiver provision which some may think is there would  be effective. i would say. in addition. that even if there were a waiver provision in the statute. it would mean that in each case a judgment must be made. we still have something called the bureau of the budget in washington.
i thank the [entleman for his comments. and i would nerely add that in many cases this requirement would involve new tax money. and some communities could  or might  wish to raise new tax money. we are dealing with community action. working with the poor and destitute. much of it through voluntary help. and if we retain the cash requirement there is question but this would cripple the efforts of the ymca. the church groups. and all other volunteer agencies that are making community action a reality. again i thank the gentleman for his comments.
. i think it is essential that before we vote we recognize that the ashbrook substitute amendment for the gibbons amendment would lower the authorization to $11.2 million with an openended authorization for gifts. as i understand this substitute amendment. it compares with a present authorization of $20 million for this fiscal year. in other words. we are sharply cutting back by almost 50 percent the present authorization. it is. however. roughly the equivalent of our present appropriaiton of $12.2 million which is still inadequate. to place an authorization on a 1year basis. however. would be a vote of questionable confidence in the arts and the humanities. we have been very fortunate in this nation in having both roger stevens and dr. keeney come to us and serve. and i would ask the indulgence of this house while i read one sentence from dr. keeney. which i hope will be pondered. because i think it is very sincerely and thoughtfully intended. he said: humanists badly need encouragement in their efforts to provide a balanced education to enable our rising generation to deal with the great human and social prcblems that are still unsolved. they can live in hope with the appropriations request. but a reduced authorization may cause them to believe that their kledge and insight is neither desired  needed. finally. it is very clear. as several distinguished gentlemen have pointed out. that we are on trial as a nation. we are on trial in this house. we are clearly at war. certainly there is a serious fiscal question. certainly there is a judgment on priorities. but i believe. most humbly. that a nation which forsakes its artists or a nation which will  fully support its humanists or a nation that creates scientists at the expense of humanists may in the end have little need for either. while we must support our men in vietnam. let us  forget that we are trying to support a world in which there are values in which they believe.
. i join several colleagues today. members of this body. the gentleman from new york. charles goodell. and the gentleman from minnesota. albert quie. and senators javits and prouty of the other body. in introducing the national manpower act of 1968. the first title of this bill consists of five major amendments to the manpower development and training act of 1962 in the form of new language and new programs to be operated by the department of labor. these amendments include a requirement for a job opportunity survey and matching of unemployed persons with employer requirements. and the creation of community service employment programs. serving 80.000 individuals in the first year. title 3i of the bill proposes a program of tax credits for businessmen who hire the hardcore unemployed. the bill would allow employers to choose either the tax credit option or direct reimbursement under present ojt programs resulting in some 220.000 jobs in the first year. according to the statistics and program of action proposed by the national advisory commission on civil disorders. it could take some 36 years to include in jobs of permanence and substance in the private sector all those  unemployed and underemployed. assuming that the jobless rate remains stationary.
the gentleman has made several points. the first was that he did  understand the rationale. or at least he was  clear as to the rationale of voting for the tax bill. i believe the rationale is clear. it is pay as you go. i believe very strongly that if one votes for some of these programs he should also be willing to stand up and support the necessary taxes. insofar as one can. to try to meet the program.
. i have introduced legislation calling for a $200 million supplemental appropriation for oeo summer programs and i feel strongly that the food. job. and headstart programs referred to in amendments 1. 21. and 25 should be fully funded. i strongly supported the $75 million for summer jobs and $25 million for headstart approved by the senate and i believe that even those amounts represent minimal levels. at a time when the nation is facing a crisis as serious as the civil war. there should be major job programs and  merely token efforts. and an increase in education funding at all levels. including headstart. etheless. the record should show that the confereesably mr. jonas.
. clearly there are four or five times that number. it is conservatively estimated that there are between 10 and 11 million people who fall into this category. who are working in jobs below their level of skill and ability. this information gap only serves to highlight the fact that our training programs are often unrelated to the location. ability. and potential of those to be assisted. in addition. it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to formulate meaningful programs and to encourage private enterprise participation without accurate kledge about the persons available to be trained and employed. a nationwide job opportunity statistics program which will provide periodic and timely information on the site. extent. and type of job vacancies. combined with a program of research and analysis by the department of labor. would further the objectives of mdta.
in response to the distinguished gentleman from iowa. the amendment specifically provides that  less than 2 percent of the sums appropriated in any fiscal year to carry out titles i. ii. and iii of the act shall be available for this purpose. there would  be added funds. it would say that of the funds appropriated 2 percent could be utilized for collecting and disseminating data. the basic purpose would be to obtain data on skills needed and persons available to fill them. at the moment we do  have adequate information in this area.
. i rise in strong support of s. 3206. the water quality improvement act of 1968. and i commend the initiative of the gentleman from florida . the chairman of the committee on public works. the gentleman from maryland . and the gentleman from minnesota . who introduced the bill. this legislation is a constructive approach to the problems caused by a reduction in federal expenditures. its principal provisions seek to preserve the momentum achieved in the last several years in water pollution control despite a cutback in the amount of federal assistance available in the forthcoming fiscal years. in the clean water restoration act of 1966. the congress provided for a vastly increased program of federal assistance for municipal waste treatment plant construction. growing from an authorization of $150 million in fiscal year 1967 to $1.25 billion for 1971. in addition. the 1966 law permitted a full 30percent federal contribution to eligible projects and increased the maximum grant to as high as 55 percent under certain circumstances. maintenance of the projected level of federal assistance is critical to the implementation of projects under the water quality standards established under the water quality act of 1965. it is estimated. for example. that we need about $6 billion for grants to states alone in order to clean up our water resources nationwide. secretary udall cites as one frequently used measure. that to restore our water to its natural state and keep it that way. we would need $100 billion between  and the end of the century. more specifically. about $1.4 billion in federal assistance is needed to meet the water quality applications presently in process. with an additional $800 million required to fund projects approved but  completed and those eligible for reimbursement. however. the congress and the administration have kept pace neither with their pledge made in 1966  with the obvious need. the administration sought and congress appropriated only $203 million of the $450 million authorized for fiscal year 1968. only $225 million of the $700 million authorized for fiscal year 1969 was requested. and the public works appropriation bill reduced this to $214 million for waste treatment grants. $18 million of this will go to new york state. yet the budget estimate for space research for fiscal year 1969 is $4.6 billionand it is expected that the total obligations for federal highway construction will be the same amount. in other words. we are spending 20 times as much for space and highways as we are to clean up the water we drink. swim. and boat in. and take fish from. this. to me. reflects a complete misconception of the needs of this nation. a clear example of our upsidedown priorities. the bill before us today attempts to deal with this situation. so that localities do  use the failure of the federal government to provide sufficient funds as an excuse for failure to move forward with their water quality standards and projects thereunder. the intent of the legislation is to permit communities to finance the federal share of the cost of waste treatment works with repayment assured from the federal government. this would be achieved through the use of contracts between the secretary and the localities. the total amount of contracts will represent twice the amount appropriated in excess of $100 million for grants in fiscal years 1969 and 1970. and for fiscal year 1971. the contract sum will be that amount appropriated in excess of $100 million. authorizations are set by existing law at $700 million in fiscal year 1969. $1 billion in fiscal year 1970. and $1.25 billion in fiscal year 1971. the contract will obligate the united states to pay. over a maximum period of 30 years. the grant covering the federal share which would be subject to the same percentage limitations  applicable to direct grants. under the present reimbursement program. a locality would undertake a waste treatment construction project with guarantee that the federal government .would pay its share. this legislation would allow the secretary to enter into contracts for those projects authorized by him since 1966 which have  been fully funded. l addition. this legislation established programs to deal with other sources of water pollutionsuch as control of lake pollution. control of acid and other mine water pollution. the control of oil pollution. and the control of sewage from vessels.
. while i commend the committees comprehensive approach to the problem of water pollution. i feel that the appropriations authorized by this legislation are totally inadequate. it has been estimated that. to restore this nations waters to their natural state and keep them that way. we would need to spend $100 billion between  and the end of the century. this bill would authorize appropriations of only $348 million during the next 3 fiscal years. i hope that my colleagues will provide full funding for this legislation. will increase the funds for water pollution control in future years. and provide funds for sewage treatment in an additional bill. there is a critical need for legislation providing for the treatment of solid wastes.
the gentleman is correct with respect to the statement about the rules committee. the education and labor committee did have urgent matters before it. which was the reason we did  appear. but i am correct in saying that the administration. i believe. will find the funds. i will point out one further fact: that for a long time we have shortchanged our senior citizens in america. we are spending $1.10 per senior citizen under existing fiscal year 1969 appropriation. $1.41 per senior citizen under fiscal year 1970 budget request. $3.10 per senior citizen under fiscal year 1970 authorization of your bill. $4.25 per senior citizen under fiscal year 1971 authorization of your bill. and $5 per senior citizen under fiscal year 1972 authorization of your bill. i do  believe this is an unduly large increase. given the potential service the senior citizen could make to our country.
. i wish merely to explain why i vote for an extension of the surtax. without the surtax. prices would skyrocketeven higher than they are . without the surtax. respect for the fiscal soundness of the united states would be placed in jeopardy overseas. without the surtax. the purchasing power of the dollar would be further eroded. hurting the consumer. however. i feel most strongly that before final enactment of this legislation. there must be major tax reform. fair to all and to relieve the hardpressed middleincome family. and i will oppose final enactment of the surtax unless tax reform is also passed.
. i feel constrained to vote against the 6month extension of the surtax today. i do  feel that there is sufficient assurance that we are going to get tax reform that will result in meaningful relief for middleincome families  action to close serious. inequitable loopholes. i feel that i would be breaking faith with my constituents if i supported a final surtax extension before such reform is. assured. the distinguished gentleman from arkansas and his colleagues on the ways and means committee have reported out a tax reform bill which we will take up later this week and which contains improvements that have been long overdue. yet i do  think that the small downward revision in the rate structure and the phased increase -in the standard deduction will really make a significant difference to the middleincome family with a mortgage. medical bills. school taxes. and children to send to college. a minimum tax on the wealthy and restrictions on the tax preferences they  enjoy provides symbolic relief to middleincome families. but actually does little to lower their tax payments. while there appears to be agreement to report a tax reform bill to the senate floor by october 31. it is far from clear that the senate will act firmly to close several blatant loopholes. such as the oildepletion allowance. indeed. the bill reported out of the ways and means committee could be stronger on this and other sensitive issues. and the measure before us today has been stripped of tax relief for the poor and repeal of the 7percent investment tax creditalthough both provisions have been included in the omnibus reform bill. thus. as the new york times commented this morning: the unanswered question is whether the impulse for reform will be seriously blunted  that the surtax is longer being held hostage by the liberal forces.... with an agreement on the surtax. there is  sure to be more backsliding in the face of pressure from the special interest lobbies. there is much talk these days about what americans in the heartland really want. i think that many americans. in whatever section of the country they reside. want relief from an intolerable and unfair tax burden. i am  satisfied that that relief is assured. and. while there are sound fiscal and monetary reasons for extending the surtax. i can in good conscience vote for an additional tax burden on american wage earners at this time. there are. to be sure. dangers in  enacting the surtax extension. but equally. there are dangers in  enacting major and meaningful tax reforms. the administration has had a number of months to work out a comprehensive and equitable plan with business. labor. and the financial community regarding the ecoy. including tax reform. continuing incentives for our competitive free enterprise system. spending controls on farm subsidies and the militaryindustrial complex. curbs on interest rates. provisions for dealing with the balance of payments. trade deficits. special drawing rights. and international liquidity. and other elements. i have indicated my willingness to vote for the surtax as an essential item in this picture to help control inflation. but  as the only item that is going to be acted on this year. the surtax will  provide relief alone.  will it alone control skyrocketing consumer prices. in short. there has just  been a timely and comprehensive approach to the problems of the ecoy. and i think it would be a disservice to the nation to vote for the surtax when progress on other related ecoic questions is far from assured.
 and the majority of the congress have seen fit. in their wisdom. to continue the surtax seems to me to give added impetus to the importancewhich i have long emphasizedof ending the war. curbing the militaryindustrial complex. and reducing farm subsidies. it would seem far better to achieve spending reductions of several billion dollars annually through these steps. and thus make additional funds available for relief to the cities and necessary programs in health. education. job training. and housing. than to continue interminably a tax which merely extends the present inequities of the tax system. middleincome americans should  have to wait indefinitely for tax relief. and i hope the other body will take appropriate steps in this direction. my other concern is with regard to the provisions which relate to the activities of foundations. although those provisions do. as the committee has pointed out. include many highly desirable steps to regulate selfdealing. tax dodging. and other abuses by foundations and their benefactors. they also include some provisions which would discourage socially beneficial philanthropy and restrict some foundation activities which have been of great value to the inative thrust in america. the worst of these is the provision which severely limits foundation supported voter registration activity. it saves only organizations operating in five or more states which are supported by five or more funding sources one of whom gives more than 25 percent. in practical effect. this means that only the voter education project of the southern regional council and the league of women voters are saved. while it would be wise to discourage foundations from supporting voter registration drives that are clearly directed at electing or unseating a certain individual. the prohibition which we are considering goes too far. it makes it impossible for concerned community groups who wish to organize a continuing concerted regular partisan registration effort to obtain foundation money for that program. laudable as the goal may be of registering hitherto disenfranchised miity citizens. we have  said that can only be done if it is done in five or more states at once. that does  seem to me to make very much sense. i hope the other body will modify this provision so that bona fide partisan continuing voter registration efforts can receive foundation assistance. there are other problems with these new foundation regulations as well. one example is the total prohibition on lobbying activity by either foundations or foundation grantees. the slightest misstep from which will cause prohibitive fines to be levied on every individual who had some decislonmaking role in making the guilty grant. this flat ban is unnecessary. and. because it seems also to preclude efforts to bring to the publics attention problems needing legislative action. it may well frighten foundations away from supporting and disseminating the results of wholly legitimate studies on pressing national problems. aher example is the tax on foundations. which only serves to lower the magnitude of private charitable activity at a time when government is  doing nearly egh to solve americas urgent domestic problems. the rationale that one should escape tax is simply inapplicable here. the original purpose of sanctioning foundations was to encourage private philanthropy. all that the 71 percent does is to slow the price of private philanthropic activity by 7 2 percent. . i hope the other body will take ice of these deficiencies and will take steps to correct them.
. i think that greater tax equity will be achieved by the passage of this bill than by its defeat. although it is  without some potentially serious inflationary dangers. stern measures may yet be required to offset this danger and there should be hesitation in applying them. lastly. however. let it be clear that a real job of major tax reform yet lies ahead. particularly for the middleincome family. the bill we are approving today is just a beginning.
i had hoped that there would be an appropriation for the current fiscal year 1970 and subsequently as much as may be appropriated. i do think there is a clear need for this. i would say to the gentleman that the administration feels that there is need for the library commission and i would hope that such differences as may exist over this. and budgetary support for this. would be resolved by the conference. if  before.
the amount is $500.000 for this fiscal year. as i said to the gentleman. i would hope that the differences over the bill would be resolved in conference and with the budget bureau. along with agreement on adequate appropriations for the remainder of this fiscal year.
 of the united states. part of the funds appropriated pursuant to this .bill shall be used to finance the introduction of american ground combat troops into laos. thailand. or cambodia. with the addition of cambodia. this is identical to the language presently in the fiscal year 1970 appropriation statute. it would be a limitation. precluding the use of american ground combat troops in cambodia.
i should like to address myself to the two points raised by the gentleman from iowa. first. on march 31 of this year the president said: in urging -the congress to approve a $20 million program for the national endowment for the arts. and an equal amount for the national endowment for the humanities. i maintained that few investments we could make would give us so great a return in terms of human satisfaction and spiritual fulfillment. more than ever . i hold to -that view. further. i would say to the gentleman. we do have a letter dated june 29. 1970 from the bureau of the budget. from richard p. nathan. assistant director. in which he confirms the administrations support for a $40 million funding level for the national foundation on the arts and humanities in the fiscal year 1971.  has gone on record approximately four times in support of the bill and the bureau of the budget has agreed to it.
 pompidous comments appear concerned with national prestige the environmental or fiscal questions. and aside even from these questions. efforts in many states continue to attempt to deny landing rights to ssts. our government would do well to advise other nations of this concern. and of the implications thereof. i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing funds to further the development of the sst. and instead. to support only the funds to terminate the governments contract obligations to the companies and the people involved. consistent with our responsibility. these costs  or at an appropriate time should compensate the airlines for having advanced $58 million at the urging of the department of transportation to boeing to be credited against future purchases. also. we owe a clear debt to boeing workers and seattle for transition and training costs for those affected by the termination of the sst.
. i would just like to close by emphasizing the point that my colleague. the gentleman from new york . has made. i do  believe that anybody in this house fully understands that new york city is faced with potentially losing  just jobs that are peripheral jobs. but jobs in vital public services such as in the hospitals. the police department. and in the fire department. there are simply funds available for some of these key jobs. in some cases. the choice is between continuing vital hospital services and the vital services of the police and fire departments. or  continuing them. absent some very marked changes in albany. frankly. i believe that the administration is opposed to public service employment of a lasting and meaningful character. this reflects. in my view. a failure to understand that 6 million americans. need jobs and a failure to understand that there are important and vital jobs in our states and cities and towns that need to be done. these are  jobs raking leaves. they are jobs that often involve saving lives. given our high unemployment rate and given the positions that must be filled. i think that the federal government has a unique opportunity to bring these two elements together. there is a clear need nationally for public service employment legislation. and i hope that this will be considered on its merits.
 nixon proposed that the nation establish a national institute of education to conduct basic and applied educational research both within the institute and by contract with universities and other organizations. in the face of growing public disenchantment with schools and increasing resistance to tax levies substantial efforts have been made by the congress to institute educational reform. federal money has been voted to assist schools with construction. improve educational programs. and strengthen educational administration. the congress has given high priority to public education. yet it is apparent that the influx of additional federal money into the schools has scarcely dented the problem. we have come to rely on a strategy of doing more of the samemore money for staff training and curriculum development. more money for special groups. special objectives and for different age levels. it is a sad fact. . it should be clear that the disappointing record of education research is the result of a curious neglect for this important function. we can ill afford to be cavalier about systematic efforts to invent and implement better ways of educatingthe sooner we get down to serious workthe sooner we can begin to see results. establishing a national institute of education represents the critical first step down that road. i urge my colleagues  to turn their backs on this opportunity to establish strong institutional leadership in educational research and development. without the help of research and development. american education can only look forward to more of the same. for too many americans. that just is  egh
i thank my colleague very much. if he will bear with me for one further point. the conference report authorizes $2 billion in appropriations for child development care for the first year in which it is fully spelled outto wit. fiscal 1973. $100 million is provided for fiscal 1972 for startup activities. it has been my understanding that the $2 billion authorization is intended by the conferees as a goal which we have established. without king what the total picture may be at the time of appropriation. for example. we do  k what may be available from other sources such as the family assistance plan. h.r. 1. if that should become law.
i thank my colleague very much. if he will bear with me for one further point. the conference report authorizes $2 billion in appropriations for child development care for the first year in which it is fully spelled outto wit. fiscal 1973. $100 million is provided for fiscal 1972. for startup activities. it has been my understanding that the $2 billion authorization is intended by the conferees as a goal which we have established. without king what the total picture may be at the time of appropriation. for example. we do  k what may be available from other sources such as the family assistance plan. h.r. 1. if that should become law.
as the gentleman ks. the authorization is $100 million for fiscal year 1973 and $150 million for fiscal year 1974. in the budget message which i have here. the u.s. department of health. education. and welfare. states. on special programs for the aging. that there is an increase in the 1973 budget to $100 million. and the president stated in his speech to the white house conference on aging: we plan to give special emphasis to services that will help people live decent and dignified lives in their own homes--services such as homedelivered meals and transportation assistance. much of this new money will be used to help marshal existing and expanded resources more effectively at the local level. in addition. the hew budget on aging clearly states thatthe primary goal will be prevention of unnecessary institutionalization for the elderly permitting them to live selfsufficient. independent. and dinifled lives in their own homes and residences. s. 1163 clearly is designed to meet these objectives. i specifically asked the white house about half an hour ago as to the posture of the budget submission for 1973 and the position of the office of management and budget. they told me it was being worked on. but that clearly the president intended in fiscal 1973 that part of the $100 million to be used for the purposes of this bill. as regards 1974. that is under study . however. it has the total backing of the presidents principal aide. secretary fleming. who testified to vthis effect just a few days ago in the senate.
. i would. like to put in the record one fiscal fact. and i would like to call to the attention of the members of the house the actual appropriation figures for past years. in 1970 we appropriated $525 million. in 1971 $603 million. and in 1972 $687 million. the budget submission for fiscal 1973 calls for $768 million. the actual appropriations have evidently followed fairly closely the authorizations with the exception of the fact that the authorizations have exceeded the appropriations by about $200 million or $300 million. the level has been going up. however. and we are hopeful that the committee on appropriations will take a hard look at this. the administration itself asked for an increase of almost $100 million between 1972 and 1973.
third. it is my understanding that in the senate bill there is provision for fiscal aid or assistance. and i am aware that there is some significant opposition downtown to that. that was offered in the senate by the distinguished senator from oklahoma.  think h.r. 1 is likely of passage and that assistance and relief in the case of new york might be forthcoming in these three areasor two out of the three.
. that i was very disappointed that the conference did  see fit to include two important provisions which had been added by the other body and which would have provided significant fiscal relief to the state of new york. although i did engage in a colloquy just last week with the gentleman from arkansas (chairman mills) on these provisions. i regret that both the javitsmondale amendment authorizing funds for child carefrom which new york state could have expected about $80 millionand aher amendment providing new york state with approximately $166 million in intermediate fiscal relief. were dropped from the bill. i was glad to see. however. that the federal takeover of aid to the aged. blind. and disabled will provide new york state with a vitally needed $168 million. which will hopefully cushion the fiscal blow that my state presently faces. finally. and briefly. i want to state my support for a number of other provisions which amend the social security act and liberalize benefits and recipient requirements.
ial veto. finally. it did  envisage an executive with the power to arrogantly refuse to provide information that congress. in its wisdom. has determined to be necessary and proper to the discharge of its legislative responsibilities.  is the effort to recapture usurped authority new. it is clear to me that congress believed that it was instituting the same reforms that my bill proposes when it enacted the budget and accounting act of 1921. i am submitting for the record a sectionbysection analysis and the full text of my bill:
. who strongly supports this increase and indeed nancy hanks. also of new york. who has done an outstanding job in developing this critically needed and vitally important program. let me say to the gentleman from new york. also. that if he would take a look at the figures of the buffalo symphony. he would find it is in a deficit operation in terms of operating expenses. and it is critically needed there.
. there has been some mention of the buffalo symphony in this debate. i think it is important because it is one of the great orchestras in america and it is widely supported in the buffalo area and throughout new york. the buffalo symphony budget is $1.6 million currently. of this there is a deficit of $720.000. that has to be made up from sources other than box office. fortunately this legislation in the past has provided $97.300 in terms of the funds that help meet the deficit. but even with that amount the buffalo symphony faces a deficit in excess of $600.000. i think this is illustrative of the problems facing our orchestras and operas and dance companies across the country and it is a valid reason why this amendment should be defeated.
. my amendment insures that local educational agency may receive fewer funds in fiscal year 1975 than it did in fiscal year 1974. the great majority would receive more. this means that all those leas scheduled to lose money under h.r. 69 would be brought up to fiscal 1974 funding levels. my amendmentand i stress thisin way changes the committee formula. orshansky would remain. my amendment. however. would help nationally. in my judgment. over 472 counties--up to 505 in fact. i believe. which stand to lose about $50 million. and they are distributed amongst 39 states. in addition. it would help numerous local school districts which would be cut back under the h.r. 69 provisions. but whose county total may be increased. thus  showing a loss on the official printout. specifically. states that are hurt by the present formulation. if they do  have an ample holdharmless at 100 percent. include new york. new jersey. and the district of columbia. the cities are philadelphia. atlanta. minneapolis. st. paul. cleveland. and others. and the number of counties. as i said. are over 472. i see the distinguished gentleman from new jersey standing. the counties in new jersey. as he ks. that could be hurt are: mercer. middlesex. ocean. passaic. atlantic. camden. and gloucester.
. commented: there are many aged millionaires  receiving the full social security benefits. however. those who must eke out the benefits by toil are penalized. it is high time there be a complete exposure of the inequities involved in many aspects of the social security system. the bill i have introduced today will remove the inequities which have become a byproduct of the retirement test. in light of our present ecoy with the cost of living steadily increasing. we must eliminate this barrier for the aged members of our society who may  have investments and savings to supplement their social security benefits. my bill will insure access to the means needed to provide these people with the ordinary decent needs of living characterized by our american society.
 johnson requested legislation. in his budget message authorizing $150 million to finance programs under the mass transit act for fiscal 1968. in my view. this 1year extension or continuation of the program of fiscal 1966 and 1967.is  going to be sufficient to meet the transportation needs of the urban commuter service in urban areas. the legislation i have introduced recognizes that in recent years the maintenance of even minimal commuter service in urban areas has become so financially burdensome as to threaten its existence. it thus provides for a 10year recuperation period. through interim assistance. for mass transit companies  engaged in developing plans and carrying out projects to revitalize their commuter operations. . we must  fail to meet the demands of our societys transportation struggle in which we are so acutely involved. as senator javits has said: we must stay ahead of the growth of our urban transit needs by developing a farsighted comprehensive plan for urban mass transit. the federal government must. with one hand. help the commuter railroads to stay alive. while on the other hand. it must give a longterm aid so that these railroads may establish a more secure ecoic position through a capitalization program designed to modernize their facilities. i believe the legislation which i have introduced today. and which appears in full following this statement. would be a needed step in the direction of meeting our transit needs of today. if  tomorrow. the two bills i have introduced today follow: h.r. 14843 a bill to amend the urban mass transportation act of 1964 to authorize certain grants on a temporary basis to assure adequate commuter service in urban areas and for other purposes. and to increase the existing limit on the grant funds which may be used thereunder in any one state be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that the congress finds(1) that over 70 per centum of the nations population lives in urban areas. and it is anticipated that by 1986. 80 per centum of the population will be concentrated in such areas. (2) that transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society and the health and welfare of that society depends upon the provision of efficient. ecoical. and convenient transportation. (3) that for many years the mass transportation industry served capably and profitably the transportation needs of the urban areas of the country. (4) that in recent years the maintenance of even minimal commuter service in urban areas has become so financially burdensome as to threaten the continuation of this vital service. (5) that some mass transportation companies are  engaged in developing preliminary plans for. or are actually carrying out. comprehensive projects to revitalize their commuter operations. and (6) that immediate substantial federal assistance is needed on an interim basis to enable many mass transportation companies to continue to provide vital commuter service during the period required to overhaul and revitalize commuter operations and to place such operations on a sound financial basis. sec. 2. the first sentence of section 4(b) of the urban mass transportation act of 1964 is amended to read as follows: "in addition to amounts heretofore appropriated to finance grants under this act. there is authorized to be appropriated for that purpose  more than $300.000.000.  less than $150.000.000 for fiscal year 1967.  more than $300.000.000  less than $150.000.000 for fiscal year 1968.  more than $300.000.000  less than $175.000.000 for fiscal year 1969. and $300.000.000 for fiscal year 1970." sec. 3. the urban mass transportation act of 1964 is amended by redesignating sections 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. and 12 as sections 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. and 13 respectively. and by adding after section 5 a new section as follows:
 johnson signed the national foundation on the arts and humanities act of 1965public law 89209. statute 845. one of the sponsors of this legislation was my predecessor.  mayor of new york city. the hoable john v. lindsay. for the history of this proviapril 5. 1966. pages 76637667. it is entirely consistent with the stated purposes of that most significant legislative step that we must recognize our obligation to all of the authors. composers. and artists in this country. to fulfill our promise of equality and justice for the arts. those who give us our great culture should also have the ecoic benefits which our industry has. let us  take the concrete step of ending the ecoic discrimination against those authors and composers of literary. musical. or artistic compositions which exists under our present tax structure. a copy of the bill follows: h.r. 14903 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that (a) section 1221 of the internal revenue code of 1954 (defining the term "capital asset") is amended by striking out paragraph (3) and redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs (3) and (4). respectively. (b) section 341(c)(2)(b) of such code (relating to collapsible corporations) is amended by striking out "section 1221(5)" and inserting in lieu thereof "section 1221(4)". (c) section 1231(b)(1) of such code (relating to property used in the trade or business) is amended(1) by striking out subparagraph (c). (2) by inserting "or" at the end of subparagraph (a). and (3) by striking out ". or" at the end of subparagraph (b) and inserting in lieu thereof a period. sec. 2. (a) part iv of subchapter p of chapter 1 of the internal revenue code of 1954 (relating to special rules for determining capital gains and losses) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section:
 johnson stated in april 1964 thatwe have entered an age in which education is  just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. it has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex. industrialized society . . . we have truly entered the century of the educated man. i hope this body gives careful consideration to the bill i have introduced today. i believe the tax credit system will serve as the best instrument of federal assistance to education in this. "the century of the educated man." it will provide the necessary help for the individual student while increasing the amount of private funds available for assistance. it is a small premium for the federal government to pay. for the. insurance that the people of our country will maintain a higher intellectual plateau than ever before. for therein lies the foundation upon which this country can grow to the heights visualized in the minds of men. but  yet attained. a copy of the bill i have introduced today and the revised proposed internal revenue service regulations and new set of proposed rules referred to above. together with explanatory comment. follow: h.r. 18288 a bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to allow a credit against income tax to individuals for certain expenses incurred in providing higher education be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that (a) subpart a of part iv of subchapter a of chapter 1 of the internal revenue code of 1954 (relating to credits allowable) is amended by redesignating section 40 as 41. and by inserting after section 39 the following new section:
 allow only $2.880 on outside by toll are penalized. it is high time there be a complete exposure of the inequities involved in many aspects of the social security system. psychologists tell us it is better for a senior citizen to occupy his time if he so chooses in a gainful way. in the light of our present ecoy. with the cost of living steadily increasing and with inflationary propensities. the best way to help the senior citizens of our society who may  have investments in savings to supplement their social security benefits. and who want to work. is to eliminate this arbitrary limitation on outside earnings. the bill i have introduced today. similar to h.r. 14408 which i introduced in the second session of the 89th congress6. page 8014will insure access to the means needed to provide these people with the ordinary decent needs of living characterized by our american society. there follows a sampling of the editorial and newspaper comments on my similar legislation in the last session: [from the indianapolis star. july 5. 19661
. we must constantly strive to maintain our tax rates so that they will reflect the most equitable taxation possible. to do this. we must recognize necessary expenses incurred by various categories of taxpayers. i urge my colleagues to consider this legislation as a realistic step toward needed tax reform. this bill is only the first step in a limited category. we must still determine what additional tax structure changes are necessary to secure equality for the single person who has special deduction for "head of household" and who has "split income" provision. is the tax structure  fair to such single persons. many people think . an interesting legal study on the question will be found in an article by douglas y. thorson entitled "an analysis of the sources of continued controversy over the tax treatment of family income." which appeared in the national tax journal. june 1965. volume xviii.  2.
. i am pleased to support h.r. 69 introduced by the distinguished gentleman from maryland . it is most appropriate on this. the 20th anniversary of the signing of the law which established the first hoover commission. that we discuss the problems of duplication. lack of coordination. and redtape characteristic of the executive branch of the federal government. in this technical age we can longer be receptive to the traditional government approach to solution of questions. the practice of dividing a complex problem into manageable parts and treating each of them separately. makes a comprehensive solution impossible. simply appropriating money and shifting responsibilities to postpone decision will  withstand the pressure of the problems currently facing our nation. the executives handling of the national budget reflects the virtual impossibility of a comprehensive solution when dealt with by current procedures. in the years 1964. 1965. 1966. and 1967. the johnson administration has spent a total of $40 2 billion more than the government has taken in. it has been estimated that by the end of fiscal year 1968. the 5year deficit may exceed $58 billion. but ody really yet ks. the approach of breaking down the budget into the usual 13 appropriation bills makes it very difficult to conceive of the whole budget when looking at only one of its parts. these separate bills find their way through the appropriation process at various speeds. with some being considered several months apart from the others. during this process. the executive branch frequently comes to congress requesting supplemental appropriations for programs enacted earlier in the session. in the 90th congress alone these supplemental requests have totaled approximately $14 billion. the need for these supplemental appropriations indicates that a realistic estimate of our nations fiscal expenditures does  exist. this failure on the part of the executive branch hampers congress determination of how much money it is actually to appropriate for the fiscal year. the result of which has been the increase of our national debt ceiling on 11 separate occasions during the kennedy and johnson administrations. the executive. finding itself in the red once too often. has resorted to several "budget gimmickry" devices. the participation sales act. passed in 1965 by a democraticcontrolled congress. is a perfect example. this act authorized the federal national mortgage association to sell "participation certificates" in government financial assets. however. the proceeds from these sales are  counted as government receipts. but as a reduction of expenditures. this means that each time the government goes further in debt. expenditures are reduced on paper by a corresponding amount of these participation certificates sold. this. of course. just distorts further the actual expenditures incurred. the unrealistic fiscal approach to the national debt problem is just aher example of the pressing need for an objective review of the federal executive in this inflationary period of our nations ecoic history. an august 25. along with several of my republican colleaguss. i introduced h.r. 17332see the congressional record. volume 112. part 2. pages 2071420719. reintroduced as h.r. 121 on january 10. 1967which provides for the establishment of a national commission of public management. the purpose of the bill is to establish a commission which could examine the techniques developed by the defense and aerospace industries for complex problem solving. and recommend how best they might be applied to critical domestic problems. the commission could bring to bear on the management of public business the very best minds in industry. government. labor. and education. through implementation of this legislation the federal government would best be able to reap the advantages of the "systems approach" developed and proven successful by many of our nations leading industries. the systems approach is especially applicable to problems consisting of many variables. for example the national budget. it relies on the capacity of new techogy to assemble. measure. and use all the information that relates to a given program. thus supplying direction for a practical solution. the executive branch with its many agencies lacks this coordinated control. all too often one arm doesnt k what the other is holding. this type of situation must be remedied. our government can longer attempt to solve todays problems with yesterdays techniques. i hope this body gives careful consideration to the recommendations and suggestions that my colleagues and i have made today.
. and  being considered by the house committee on ways and means. those people living in cities having a population of 1 million or more. the second piece of legislation i have introduced would amend the internal revenue code to provide a 10percent credit against the income tax for individuals also living in cities with a population of more than 1 million. thus. whether or  the proposed 10percent surtax is enacted into law. the citizentaxpayer of our large cities will be afforded some relief from the unfair position in which he finds himself under the federal income tax system. the article attached. from the- new york times of wednesday. october 11. 1967. points up the plight of the city dweller on cost of living:
i would like to return to the points the senator from new york made in connection with tax reform. we are all told to postpone this action. because the administration is going to come forward with a tax reform proposal in the fall. the senator pointed out that this senate is going to wrestle with the energy program starting soon and that will take up well up into the summer. i presume.
then we get to the question. are we going to get to the socalled tax reform. i feel. and i k the senator shares these views. that we should get on with the tax cut for the american public. both for the reasons which have been cited before. the stimulation for the fairness of those who have been forced into higher brackets although their net take home pay in the value of their dollars has decreased. and also i think we want to get on with this. because i do  see what else is going to be done.
i thank the senator very much. i believe his arguments have been persuasive. i have seen the senior senator from virginia hang on to every word. i believe we have him tilting. i think probably the only thing we need to make this thing completely successful is to put that magic word "reform" before it. that gives it a mythical quality that all can support. a tax reform seems to have a better savor to the american public and to the senators than just the mere words "tax reduction."
. i wish to associate myself with earlier remarks by the distinguished chairman and ranking miity member of the environmental pollution subcommittee concerning water pollution amendments to the jobs bill. the senates provision of $9 billion for water treatment construction grants was completely true to the spirit of this legislation. water treatment projects create jobs and these funds are greatly needed by states who already have or are close to running out of water treatment money. the senate conferees made every effort to reach agreement on the water pollution issues. but were  able to settle our differences with the house in every instance. it is important to e. however. that we did agree on specific proposals for several crucial measures. including municipal and industrial deadline extensions. but the other major disagreements still remained. so the senate will proceed on its own clean water bill. as a membr of the environmental pollution subcommittee. i look forward to working on these comprehensive water pollution amendments. as senator muskie has stated. we will work quickly and carefully.
i supported every oic expenditure that came befcre our committee and cur distinguished miity leader on the committee ks that. i supported the youth employment bill. but that is  going to get us very far. three hundred and fifty thousand jobs they talk about if everything goes well. here is the chance to do something different. "  lets keep going down the same path that has  gotten us anywhere." i do  think that is very venturesome for these times.
. i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the senior senator from new york for calling attention to these really serious international ecoic problems. i also think the senator is one who constantly keeps his eye on this area. which is of incredible importance. it seems to me. furthermore. he calls attention to  just what we have got to urge other countries to do. but what we have got to do ourselves. he makes the point that the united states is longer the decisionmaker in the worlds ecoic system. and he points out the lack of research and development expenditures in this country. he points out the inability of u.s. industry to generate capital. he points out that the tax incentives that the administration has proposed are really oneshot things and do  meet the problems of this nations industry for greater capital investment. he points out the dangers of rising protectionism and the lack of techogical ination. this never came home to me stronger than recently on a trip to panama. where i spent some time viewing the panama canal. there. they constantly have to dredge the canal. more dirt has been taken out of that canal since it was built than during the construction process of the canal. recently. the canal company purchased a monstrous dredge. nearly as high as the ceiling of this chamber. the latest techogical dredge. costing many. many millions of dollars. just the kind of thing we build in the united states. but where was that dredge built. it was built in japan. they could manufacture it. bring it across the ocean. and sell it here at a cheaper price. plus 25 percent. than the americans could manufacture the dredge for themselves. so something has gone wrong in our system. we see it also in the steel industry. which has run into problems.  because of imports but because our steel industry is  as inative and as techogically sound as the japanese steel industry. the senior senator from new york points out the need for making longterm capital investments instead of keeping the money in short term measures. he points out. further. the need for a stable currency in the united states and the need to cut our dependence on highcost foreign oil. it seems to me that it is high time congress passed an energy bill. i hope the conferees will get together. certainly. i have a type of billwe all dothat i would like to have passed. but let us get on and pass some type of bill. i ask the senator this question: on page 9 of his remarks. he deals with the lack of longterm confidence in our business community due to the need to spur capital investment. it seems to me that what we are talking about is our tax system. because that is what determines the kind of capital investment we have. i agree with the senior senator from new york that the socalled $34 billion tax cut does  do this. it seems to me that we have to get on with an increase in the investment tax credit. more rapid depreciation. and other measures of that type. i wonder whether the senior senator from new york has some specifics in that area. because he is kledgeabl in this field. and i think we all wouldi rely on his judgment of what is the bes measure to meet this problem.
i agree with the senator. it seems to me that we have to get the message through to the administration. they seem incredibly hesitant in this area. as the senator from new york mentioned. they think there is something immoral in their judgment in helping our industry become more productive through tax reductions. it is  a tax break. the government is  entitled to take everything from somebody and say that if they are cutting it back a little. they are giving you a break. the government has to prove its case before they take money from individuals or from corporations. i agree with the senator from new york as to more rapid depreciation. there is hing wrong with even going to 100 percent depreciation. the government will lose the first year. but they will get it the next year. as to increasing the investment tax credit. it should  be to build new plants. as the president proposed. he proposed broadening the investment tax credit. he would have it cover new construction. that is  what we need. we need to have better machinery. more modern. inative equipmentjust the points the senator from new york made in his speech. i hope the administration will change its thrust and go to an increase in the investment tax credit. more rapid depreciation. so that this country can become more competitive with the rest of the world. and thus get our own house in order and followthrough with the constructive suggestions the senator from new york makes.
it presents the kind of concern that caused me to raise it with the panamanians. i pointed out to them that this canal is dependent upon  just operation. because once operation stops and the ships do  go through. everybody objects. there is also this preventive maintenance question that the senator raises. that is why i was particularly interested in getting to k personnally the top people in the panamanian government. as i am sure the senator from nevada ed when he was there. the top officials in the panamanian government are  military leaders. they are extremely well educated. extremely well motivated. intelligent. competent civilians. i was impressed by their realization of this and their dedication to the principle that this canal has to be maintained if they are going to get the revenue from it that they are looking forward to in the future.
it would be my hope that the united states. panama. and a few other countries in the world would pay more attention to fiscal responsibility. but back to the maintenance that we were touching on before. as the senator from nevada ks. being a former distinguished gover. this maintenance problem is a constant difficulty. but i think in the canal situation there is one point that perhaps makes it different than the experiences we had in our own states where we could defer this or that. defer new painting at the institutions. defer the maintenance of our heating systems. there if we failed the results were  so severe. but in the canal i think everybody appreciates that failure to do the proper dredging. failure to do the proper detection of potential landslides can result in such mammoth results that it would be catastrophic. a landslide coming into the canal is incredibly expensive to remove. and i think those who have been associated with the canal. including the panamanians. are cognizant of this. so this alone i believe will create a great incentive for them to keep that canal in top condition. i would refer once again to the capabilities of the civilian ministers of the government which i believe the senator was impressed with. as was i. we can only also mention that many of them received their education in the united states. this does  make them perfect. but at least it makes them think in the same terms as many americans do.
i think the point the senator make3 is an extraordinarily good one. it would seem to me that those who are so dedicated to the free enterprise system. such as the distinguished senator from nevada. would realize that there is hing stronger to create an incentive to keep something going successfully than a selfinterest. the panamanians will get a significant amount of their prospective budget in the future from the successful operation of the canal. canal. income. and so what greater incentive could we give any country than that.
also. i think the point should be made that it is  tomorrow when they start running that canal. and by the way they are running 70 to 80 percent of the jobs anyway there. but let us hear from the senator from idaho who has some views.
. we are at a point in our country when inflation and unemployment threaten to cover us with the awesome force of aher depression. we need someone to head the federal reserve board who believes that threat can be countered. as does mr. miller. we need someone who prefers to let the free market work in the traditional way that has made us a strong nation. as does mr. miller. i can assure you. just as the entire business community can. that the trust you have shown in this distinguished rhode islander by your vote has  been misplaced. i have complete confidence in bill millers ability. and the country is fortunate to have someone with his talent come forth to serve his nation.o
. that we are digging a hole in which taxpayers would rather  be. the rationale for constructing this building was to help alleviate staff overcrowding. in fact. the size of the senate staff has almost doubled since 1968. and the legislative budget has more than tripled in that time. but a new building will only compound this growth.  cure its symptoms. i am a firm believer in parkinsons lawthat work expands to fill the time available. i am also a firm believer in chafees lawthat staff expands to fill the space available. does anyone really think we in the senate are  imaginative egh to find ways to employ sufficient people to overcrowd this third senate office building. is it really necessary to build aher marble giant whose gross square footage will almost equal the combined area of both the russell and dirksen senate office buildings. two structures that already give us over 31 acres of floor space. in 1972. when funds were first appropriated for the hart building. it was "only" a $48 million project. that escalated to $68 million in 1973. and $85 million in 1974. the architect of the capitol recently requested an additional $37 million for completion of the building. which would bring its total cost to $122 million. let us look at the record and make a realistic appraisal of this buildings final cost. since first conceived and funded 6 years ago. its "final cost" has gone up over 150 percent. so. for the sake of argument let us say that "final cost" will go up aher 75 percent in the 3 years before the doors open in may 1981. that would make the final bill a whopping $213 million. look at it this way: thats approaching half the current budget for the entire state of rhode island. this project is already establishing itself  as memorial to the hoable philip a. hart. but as an offensive monument to the continued growth of the senates bureaucracy. if we desire to halt inflation. we have to cut back on every project where its effects are being most painfully felt. let us start with a massive building intended solely for the comfort and convenience of 100 americansthe ones who voted for the structure in the first place. if congress intends to tell federal agencies and departments to tighten their belts in the fight against inflation. then the senate must be willing to strike the first blow and set an example. i am  going to be swayed by the old argument of. "well. weve already spent so much money. we have to go ahead." as a former secretary of the navy. i have heard that one before. we have to stop this right .0 by mr. mathias (for himself and mr. bayh): s.j. res. 130. a joint resolution designating john philip sousas "the stars and stripes forever" as the national march of the united states. to the committee on the judiciary.
i appreciate that. i can remember when this safe boating act went in. i was in the state government of my state at the time. the only point i would like to make is that it is like all programs. that once they start. we never seem to be able to get rid of them. with the states operating with surpluses. i would hope that at some point down the line we would determine that this is a program the states should handle by themselves. including raising the money for it. i am delighted that we are under the budget. i also am aware that the budget itself is some $50 billion in deficit. so we are  exactly home free. i hope we can make continued progress. i congratulate the senator that we are under the budget on this item. and i hope most of the measures that come before us will be under the budget.
. i joined in cosponsoring the amendment of the senator from delaware. on looking over this budget. senators will e that the total increase over last year is $1.5 billion. . that is a pretty good sum of money. even for this institution. of course. some of that can be accounted for. a half billion dollars of it can be acccunted for by the total of financial operations to make up the payments to the 31 states the senator from florida was discussing earlier. also. we have a 7percent inflation factor that we can take into account. so that is aher $524 million. but even after allowing for those two amountsand. mind you. allowing for a 7percent inflation factor seems to me to be fairly generouseven after doing that. we still have a whopping halfbillion dollar increase over last year.
all right. round it off at eight. as i say. i have allowed in here for an inflation factor of over $500. million. you can have it twice. in other words. you have to cut down the $800 million by the over $500 million we have allowed for inflation. even if you do that. you still come out with a substantial increase over the current year.
 i am prepared to increase that amount from $503 million to $800 million. but even if you do that. and it seems to me that would be more than fair. you still have come up with a budget substantially over this current year. by more than $200 million. and that is giving you everything you want. i just think that. for example. when we look at a federal law enforcement training center that goes up 25 percent over last year. or when we look at the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. with a 10percent increase over the prior year. the customs service. an 11percent increase. the bureau of public debt. i appreciate they are  paying the debt. this is the group that services the debt. in other words. gets the savings bonds out. reimburses the federal reserve for certain servicesbut that is going up. with a 55percent increase. internal revenue service. a jump of 10 percentin other words. i appreciate that we want these services.
it just seems to me. . that we are in a situation where one wants to wield a meat ax on any of the operations of the government. but we have come forward with a budget that it is hard to follow from day to day. but certainly one would quarrel that the total budget is $50 billion in deficit. i do  think any ecoist in the nation would claim that inflation is  directly related to deficits in the federal budget. i do  envy the members of the appropriations committee. i think they have a very difficult and. indeed. thankless job.
they have to listen to very emotional requests. just as any executive does. for more money for this and more money for that. i expect every member of the senate has been before that committee asking for more. i have been present asking for more. for certain programs i am interested in. as every other senator has. so it is a very difficult task. but somehow we have to get control of this thing. i do  think we can balance our budget by 1981. as the president originally suggested and as he later backed off from. but i would certainly like to see little steps made all along the line to cut back on our spending. so on that basis. i would support the amendment of the senator from delaware.
. i support the position of the senator from missouri. so far as my state is concerned. it would  be affected under this formula. anyway. i do see great dangers in bringing a new formula into effect in this program. how are we going to do it. are we going to do it as suggested by the senator from new mexico. based on rural population. should we do it based on the cost of living in a state. under that. it seems to me we could have all kinds of varied programs. one state could get more because it is more expensive to live there. i am surprised that somebody from alaska does  say that they should get much more than the formula provides. because everybody ks it is far more expensive to live in alaska. it seems to me that there are great dangers and difficulties in varying from the formula which has worked with some success for these many years. so i oppose the amendment by the senator from new mexico. artful though it may be.
i would like to answer a couple of points made on the floor. first. the point that the steel is up. why did we  do something sooner. the answer is that 31/2 months ago. before there was a single bit of steel. i wrote the rules committee and submitted a resolution and asked for them to kill this building. to stop. hing happened. therefore. it proved to be the greatest incentive for acceleration for the steel erection business that has ever taken place. the construction company went all out. we did what we could. but hing came from the rules committee. hing came before this senate. so this is the only way we can get something done. second. the chairman of the appropriations committee says this is  the appropriate place. he says for us to wait for some bill to come from omb. but if we wait. then we will be caught in a catch22 situation. people will say. "why didnt you do something sooner." so we moved on this supplemental in order to stop everything in connection with this building. . is can this senate really do anything about inflation. we all complain. every speaker gets up and speaks about inflation. we passed overwhelmingly a resolution the other day that there will be a balanced budget in 21/2 years. here is a chance to do something. let us stop this foolish building that somehow got out of control. the answer is. "we are caught up. we can do anything about it." i say it is better to cut our losses. cut them at $30 million rather than plunging into $200 million. as for an appropriate memorial for senator hart. i will support any kind of appropriate memorial. but i have difficulty believing that this would be the most appropriate one but the key point is inflation is really the scourge of this nation. let us make some small gesture to stop that inflation.
. i realize that the mood of this congress is to trim the budget wherever possible and accordingly i would ask that the committee and the senate include in this legislation for fiscal year 1979 only $3.5 million. this is the amount estimated to be needed this year to accelerate the ongoing inventory program so it can meet the 1981 deadline mandated in the clean water act. the money is also needed to do more detailed large scale wetlands maps and analyses of wetlands values. and then get this information out to the states who need it so desperately. it is certainly questionable that the states have the resources to do the job themselves. if we fail to finance this nrogram in a timely and adeouate fashion. the net result will be increased costs. uncoordinated program planning. lack of information and assistance at the state level. and. saddest of all. ever increasing losses of fish and wildlife rezources. so i viorously sunt the ampndment. and commend to te distinguished floor leader for the bill that the amendment be ancpnted.
i certainly appreciate the thoughtful consideration the distinguished manager of the bill is giving to this problem. i appreciate also the point he raised about this matter  having come forward for hearing. there is some money there for this purpose. an amount that is unfortunately  adequate. $1.6 million. that sum was there before the passage of the clean water act. which imposed very great additional burdens. which i mentioned. and all of which came after the fiscal year 1979 budget cycle was completed. therefore. i will follow the recommendation of the senator from kentucky and i withdraw my amendment. i ask that the appropriations committee  only look with sympathy on including this in the supplemental but that they be very aware of the possible necessity for some reprograming. should that come before the senators subcommittee in any fashion. i hope he would be prepared to give that a sympathetic ear and press it along. we would be most grateful. by "we." i am speaking for the senator from kentucky as well because i k of his concern for the wetlands throughout his state and the nation as well.
those are the risks we take. but i think the most serious single problem facing this nation is inflation. the fact that the federal budget is in a $50 billion deficit. the modest attempts that are being made by acrosstheboard 2 percent cuts. i wish we could do it in a more genteel way. a more skillful way. but that is about the only way we have.
. i support the senates position in this matter of new additional spending for public works. under present inflationary conditions. it is unthinkable. i believe the second concurrent resolution on the federal budget should  be interpreted in any other way. i would like to comment that. as i understand. the budget deficit for fiscal 1978 is $51 billion. and under this proposal it would be less than $40 billion. namely. $39.8 billion for fiscal 1979. is that correct.
. and i am sure as both the sponsors of this part of the tax bill do. but i believe that i speak for the citizens of my state. and i think all of us can say the same thing that the principal concern our people have is inflation and the only way we are going to do something about it is to make every effort to cut back spending. i do  think there is a person in this chamber who is  voting to reduce taxes. and indeed i voted to reduce taxes. but at the same time i want to cut down spending to the greatest extent possible. so i commend the able senator from missouri for his amendment. i listened to him debate on this. i thought the points he made were extremely good as backed up by the senator from oklahoma. and i certainly hope that this amendment prevails today.
the skim factor is for the bureaucracy here in washington to pay this public servant or that public servant or that gs19. that gs10. i do  k what the filter rate is. what the skim rate is. but if it is less than 20 percent i would be amazed before the shower falls gently as soft as dew back on new york. back on california. a pittance perhaps on rhode island.  too much. just egh to tempt. just egh to tempt us. "come along for $2.3 million." well. . i do  think we can be bought for $2.3 million. it is tempting. but we will resist. we will resist because our hopes are that somehow this little effort in resisting will assist in curbing this vicious inflation.  everyone in the united states is included into some indexing system.  everyone is like the civil servants or the retired military that on october 1 received a pay raise because the inflation index went up. and they are taken care of. that is great. but what about the people who saved. remember those ads when we were growing up that showed the silverhaired mother and father in their row boat in florida saying. "i retired in florida on $200 a month." these were the ads that tempted people to save and make this effort. that was in 1939 and 1940. two hundred dollars would  get them through a week . and if there is one thing we can do in this senate. it is attempt to curb government spending and thus reduce the inflation that is working such wicked effects on this nation. i thank the senator.
s blessing. and it will make the job of our conferees with the house a slight bit easier. i am sure the chairman can appreciate that. the table follows: metzenbaumchaffee amendment to the revenue act1978 portion portion attributable attributable to rehabili- to rehabilitotal construc- tation1976 total construc- tation1976 tion activity- (percentage of tion activity- (percentage of state 1976 ($ millions) total) state 1976 ($ millions) total) alabama -------------------------- 278.8 13.8 nebraska ------ -------------------- 108.1 15.1 alaska ---------------------------- 128.7 13.8 nevada ---------------------------- 140.7 11.8 arizona --------------------------- 585.3 4.7 new hampshire -------------------- 60.8 12.8 arkansas -------------------------- 110.4 13.3 new jersey ----------------------- 467.5 14.2 california ------------------------- 2.736.1 18.5 new mexico ---------------------- 116.2 16.1 colorado ------------------------- 300.8 14. 1 new york ------------------------- 636.9 16.7 connecticut ----------------------- 191.6 25.4 th carolina ------------------- 312.7 19.4 delaware -------------------------- 29.5 12.9 th dakota ---------------------- 54. 1 13.1 florida ---------------------------- 879.5 19.0 ohio ------------------------------ 916. 1 13.9 georgia -------------------------- 346.0 13.3 oklahoma ------------------------ 282.0 22.5 hawaii ---------------------------- 117.5 15.8 oregon --------------------------- 210.9 21.0 idaho ----------------------------- 80.8 16.8 pennsylvania --------------------- 564.4 11.6 illis ---------------------------- 874.5 22.8 rhode island ---------------------- 50.6 18.2 indiana --------------------------- 346.1 17.4 south carolina ------------------- 128.4 11.5 iowa ------------------------------ 268.2 11.3 south dakota ---------------------- 51.3 16.0 kansas ---------------------------- 192.1 14.8 tennessee ------------------------ 347.5 11.7 kentucky ------------------------ 186.8 8.6 texas ---------------------------- 1.482.1 17.9 louisiana -------------------------- 294.0 18.2 utah ------------------------------ 154.0 5.9 maine ---------------------------- 46.1 22.6 vermont ------------------------- 14.4 18.1 maryland -------------------------- 365.5 15.7 virginia --------------------------- 473.6 16.7 massachusetts -------------------- 354.4 36.1 washington ---------------------- 431.0 13.2 michigan -------------------------- 599.3 15.6 west virginia ---------------------- 65.6 16.0 minnesota ------------------------- 303.6 15.4 wisconsin ------------------------ 394.7 11.2 mississippi ----------------------- 105.7 15.9 wyoming -------------------------- 38.2 15.7 missouri ------------------------- 334.5 21.6 montana -------------------------- 74.9 25.6 u.s. total ------------------ 17.908.2 16.4 source: department of commerce. bureau of census. construction division: unpublished data on annual building permits (3014 places by state) 1967. 1976.
. under the present u.s. law. and the laws of almost every country in the world. earnings by foreign subsidiaries of u.s. companies are  subject to u.s. tax until these earnings are remitted to the corporate parent in the united states. in a particular country. the subsidiary pays the same taxes as all other corporations located in the country. thus. until profits are actually paid to shareholders outside the foreign country. all businesses competing in the same foreign country are taxed the same. this "separate entity" treatment results in equality of tax treatment. what the church amendment proposes is that the united statesbreaking away from the other major industrial powersdisown this concept of equality of tax treatment. it would do this by saying that it does  matter whether all or any part of the earnings of the foreign subsidiary are actually paid out in dividends to its american owners but that the united states will compute taxes each year as if all such earnings were paid out. this. in effect. is the imposition of an "anticipatory tax" and is a bad idea for the following reasons:
. i listened with care and tried to follow what the senator from louisiana was saying this bill contained. let me see if i have it correctly. and i would appreciate it if he would be willing to answer a couple of questions. since this is an important matter. as the senator from missouri said. the  1 requirement. suggestion. or recommendation from all of the ecoists was to somehow increase the ability for capital investment in this nation. . as i see it. there are three ways to do this. or really four ways: one. to increase depreciation. more rapid depreciation. two. to increase the investment tax credit. three. to reduce the corporate rate. and four. to do something really significant in capital gains. as i followed the outline. i may  have caught it all. there is increase in the investment tax credit. is there. it is made permanent. but i do  think anybody thought it would disappear. there is increase except that a greater percentage can come under the investment tax credit. is that it.
. it troubles me a great deal that government policiesmatter how inadvertentlyare creating a heavier burden for the people who fund our profit organization. i have always supported efforts to simplify personal income tax returns. this has benefited the many people who find it difficult to deal with a long and complex system of itemization. however. i also believe that the interest of fairness requires us to provide a simple deduction for individuals who make charitable contributions. whether they itemize their tax returns or . as subtle as this change might be on individual behavior. it would certainly provide a clear statement of national policy in support of private initiative and our great profit institutions. i urge my senate colleagues to give s. 219 swift and favorable consideration.
. and i can testify to this. they have a free press that rivals anything we have. they have cartoons against the opposition in their press that would make herblock wince with their vigor. turkey has emous problems. the ecoic aid we are providing by this bill will help. but it is  egh. to restrict its military assistance to loans is unrealistic and iges the existence of those fiscal difficulties. if this amendment passes. we will send a message that we understand turkeys problem. and that we are indeed a steadfast ally.
$13 million. that is right. $13 million of furniture that was cut out. but everybody ks that is going to be back in. every single one of these items will be restored. one of the most attractive items they cut out was an energy control item. something to save energy. that will go whipping right back in. in these times. actually. it is one of the items that ought to be in there if we go ahead with this building. so as to the real cost of this building. judging from the worlds worst estimators. which the group handling estimations on this building have proven themselves to be. they say  it will cost $174.600.000. and we all k they are wrong. and they are wrong on the down side. so it will come right back to that figure we discussed last year. $200 million.  appealed to the people: "be with me." he said. "are you with me." and they cheered. and they are with him and they will do all they can. is it right for us. 100 senators. sitting here.  exactly in undignified surroundings. to proceed with this building that will cost $200 million and say to the people. "well. you save. you fight inflation. but  us. we need more staff. we need bigger offices. we need rooftop restaurants. we need paneled offices. but you save. you peasants out there. but  us. dont have us cut back." . it is characterized as being asinine for anybody to suggest. "lets say stop. lets close this thing in. seal it in. some day. hopefully. this country will have its budget balanced again. some day maybe we will have inflation under control. and at that time we can proceed." . the distinguished junior senator from louisiana undoubtedly will be here at that time and when we proceed to go ahead with that building. he will say. "look. we could have had it for $200 million.  it is going to cost x million dollars." that is  the point. the point is. can we afford it . is it the right thing to do.
. that saving and concern about inflation are for those people out there. but  for us. i think it would be a wonderful symbol to the nation if we just stopped. if we voted " on proceeding with this building. i reserve the remainder of my time.
. the facts regarding the rayburn building are  as stated. the rayburn building was  more expensive than this building. even taking the escalated costs since then. the $20 million cost apparently suggested. that came from the house inaction last year. that figure came from the architect of the capitols office. there is one thing consistent about his figures: they have been wrong right from the beginning. when he started saying this building would cost $46 million. this talk about a strippeddown versionyes. this is a strippeddown version. the total cost of the building.  stripped down. they say. will be $174 million. i do  think anybody here thinks that that $174 million will  be reached. yesterday alone. the strippeddown version was presented at 10 oclock in the morning. by 6 oclock in the evening. five more million dollars had been added. the paneling was put back in. the restaurant was put back in. the central hearing room put back in. every one of these features will be added in. so the building will be. at the minimum. at $174 million and a great deal more than that before we are through. one thing that is accurate is that their figures are so inaccurate. ody can have confidence in them. furthermore. i do  think anyone will suggest that when this building is completed. they will  remodel the dirksen and the russell office buildings to make similar offices. it seems to me this is a tremendously important. symbolic effort we are taking today. if this building can be stopped cold. we shall say to the american people. "we are serious about this inflation and we are willing to do our part
. later this year and next year the finance committee will be considering the reauthorization of the general revenue sharing program. clearly. this would be the best time to study the ways in which we might reform the program. there have been suggestions that it would be better to target revenue sharing to the states and towns which have the more severe ecoic problems. rather than showering revenue sharing dollars on virtually every state government and municipality. regardless of need. this. too. could save the taxpayers a substantial sum of money. but i do  think the amendment offered today by the senator from wisconsin would be particularly constructive given our ecoic situation. and i will vote against it.0
. on friday. september 7. 1979. i introduced a windfall profits tax proposal. to conform with the constitution. which requires revenue bills to originate in the house of representatives. my proposal was introduced as an amendment to h.r. 3919. the windfall profits tax bill that has already passed the house and is  pending before the finance committee. today i am reintroducing my proposal as a bill. this will enable my proposal to receive a bill number and aid those who wish to learn more about it by allowing it to be printed and easily located. my remarks explaining the bill can be found on page 23560 of the congressional record for september 7. 1979.0 by mr. mathias:
. what we are voting on . for the benefit of those who have  had the opportunity to follow this throughout. is an amendment that would reduce the tax rate on lower tier oil from 75 percent. as in the committee bill. to 60 percent. in other words. oil that formerly was pegged at $6 a barrel. this amendment would reduce the tax from 75 to 60 percent. i remind those who are listening that in this senate version of the windfall profit tax we substantially reduced or indeed eliminated in many areas taxes that existed under the house bill. we completely eliminated any tax whatsoever on newly discovered oil. under the house bill there was a 56 or 60 percent tax on that. there was a 60percent tax on incremental tertiary. we eliminated that. that goes  to the world price under the senate bill. heavy oil goes to the world price under the senate bill with windfall profit tax whatsoever. we provided in the senate bill that stripper production by independent producers of 1.000 barrels or less per day is exempt from any windfall profit tax. we made those various eliminations. and in order to make up some of the revenue we provided that the tax on the lower tier oil. here people are making a handsome profit at $6 a barrel. and the price will go to the world price. $23. $30 a barrel. on that difference there would be a 75 percent tax.
first. i would like to make one thing quite clear. if i might. and i think the senator from kansas will agree to this. that a reduction in the socalled windfall profits tax is  going to reduce the price to the consumer one nickel. the price is set by a worldwide cartel. namely. opec. and the price of oil produced in the united states is going to rise to make that world price. so when we talk about the effect on the taxpayer. the effect on the taxpayer in the united states whether this tax is 80 or 50 or 30 or 75 percent is going to be exactly the same. it is  like somebody driving up to his pump and going to find the price is going to vary depending upon the tax here that is enacted in accordance with this bill. next. the distinguished senator from kansas talked about production response. it is true in the finance committee we discussed production response ad infinitum. and what production response is at what point. if you lower your tax. going to give you the greatest production. probably the greatest production response we could receive is to have tax. income tax. windfall profits tax. and the oil companies presumably then would have every incentive to go out and produce a lot of oil. but on the other side we have to have certain revenues coming into the federal government to accomplish certain purposes. one of the objectives of this bill is to provide funds for alternative sources of energy. for solar energy. and for conservation. one will argue about our need to diversify our energy supplies. in the finance committee. with everybody joining in. we voted all kinds of tax credits for conservation and alternate sources. in the discussion of the production response. realizing we had to have some revenue. we then looked at the best sources we could find. namely. the department of energy. the joint tax committee. and later. the congressional budget office to learn from them what the results would be with these varied taxes on the different tiers of oil. it was agreed in the finance committee nearly unanimously. 19 to 1. which is about as strong a vote as you can get anywhere around here. that we would exempt the new oil: every possible production response incentive available for new oil. but then we looked at the other tiers of oil. the one we are discussing here today is the upper tier. socalled tier 2 oil. and the reports we had were that it really was a negligible difference between the housepassed bill at 60 percent and what some of us sought in the finance committee. 75 percent. i quote from the department of energy: a windfall profits tax at 75 percent would  have significant effect on tier 2 production from existing oil fields. from the congressional budget office: raising the tax rate on upper tier oil from the housepassed 60 percent to the proposed 75 percent. the supply response would change only marginally. so. based upon those figures. we arrived in that committee. nine of us. and here on the senate floor. 57 of usat least in rejection of the motion to tablethat 75 percent was a worthwhile tax rate to go to. we agree that the revenue produced of some $24 billion was significant. so i would like to take issue with the comments made by the distinguished senator from kansas in his suggestion that we are crushing all production resonse. we are  crushing production response. at $13 a barrel. which the upper tier oil has been selling for. it is going along merrily making a profit. . we have that. plus inflation. we have that. plus 25 percent of any difference between the $13 and the world price at $28 or whatever it might be as i mentioned. are sinificant. the ways of spending that money are of great consequence to the nation. if something goes wrong we can always change it in the future. but i do  think there will be any need to. in closing. 
the difficulty is that i do  k who can speak for the others on the floor. or the rest of the senate. i personally would  support a substantial minimum tax on new oil. i k that there are some other amendments particularly dealing with the stateowned oil and there is one. as you mentioned. on the phaseout. i do  quite k where that stands. who can guarantee the way those are going to come out. i do  k who is around that can strike the deal.
you take the selling price and deduct the base price. so we are  down to $17. $13 from $30 is $17. you then deduct from that the severance taxes. state taxes. whatever they are. say they amount to $3. that gets you down to $14. then your windfall tax applies to that.
i think it is very important to bear in mind that unlike the house bill. the bill that has come from the senate finance committee. which was supported by a vote of 19 to 1. provides that newly discovered oil is  subject to the windfall profit tax at all. one of the senators theses was that there was  much incentive. there is -every kind of incentive for the discovery of new oil under this legislation.
that is right. but i believe the point the senator was making was that there were  many incentives. i think the senator has to remember we are talking about old oil. tier 2 is old oil. that is oil that has already been discovered. which is flowing profitably at $13 a barrel. it is also important to bear in mind that the $13 base price is  static forever. the $13 base price is increased by inflation. so the $13 rolls up to $14 or $15. or whatever it might be. based on whatever the inflation rate is. so it is oil that is being produced at a profit at the current time. if you wish to drill for new oil within a field then you get the intangible drilling expenses. and so forth. if you go out and discover brand new oil then. of course. you are  subject to the windfall profit tax whatsoever.
i would  necessarily agree with that. because the projections we have. the forecasts. to the best of the ability of those who do them. show that raising the tax from 60 to 75 percenti think we have to accept as a basis that the tax is going to be at least 60 percent. that having passed the house and that having come out of the committee in the senate. the difference between the tax going from 60 to 70 percent. as far as reflection on production. is minimal. it is in the neighborhood of a 1percent decrease in the expected production. these figures come from the congressional budget office analysis of the tax that has been proposed here. both the 60 and the 75 percent.
. i would like to have a brief colloquy. if i might. with the distinguished sponsor of the. amendment. because i have some problems here. it seems to me we have taken care of the independents. or at least a very substantial portion of them. with the 1.000barreladay exemption. before the finance committee. as the acting floor leader just said. the testimony was that the majors were  interested in the plowback provision because of the difficulties in calculating it. but setting all that aside. here is the difficulty i have: you have a well that is producing a large amount. all wells do  decline at a rate of 12 percent a year. i think that is accepted. some relatively new wells are pumping along at a relatively even amount. there is the type of well one could easily jump up to get the increased production for this tax credit. you have aher set of wells that are declining very rapidly. so would  the logical thing be. in order to get these tax credits. which are very substantialas i understand it. each 1 percent above the level amounts to 25 percent of credit. up to 3 percent. which amounts to 75 percent. and then there is a cutoff. is that correct.
. this is an incredibly complicated situation. and i do  feel i have the expertise. at this late hour. with the time limit. to come in with an amendment. i stand shouldertoshoulder with the senator from oklahoma in opposing the tax on new oil. i will vote against it. but i have great reservations as to this proposal we have before us. because of the incredible difficulties presented to us in hearings.
it seems to me that the concern. as i see it. is that we have a real problem on the point the senators amendment touches on. namely. that for some peculiar reasons. the holdings of a state and the production from state lands are exempt. of course. that has hing to do with producing more windfall profit tax revenuewhich the senator from california and the others on that side are so interested in. this $185 billionand it really has hing to do with producing more oil. but it does satisfy the states that have the income. it seems to me the more serious problem is what is going to happen with the tremendous revenues that these four states are going to receive from their severance tax on the windfall total price--in other words. when oil goes to the world price. i do  k what louisianas severance tax is. is it 17 percent.
if you are getting 121/2 percent on $13 and there is competitionthere is free marketplace heresome people sitting in vienna or tunis. or wherever it is. under the color of opec. set the price at $24. $26. $30. whatever it is. the 121/2 percent follows right along with that. research has indicated that in the next 10 years. between  and 1990. $128 billion additional revenue--these are billions.  millions-$128 billion of additional revenue is going to those states that have oil production. and 83 percent of that is going to four states. eighty three percent of the $128 billion goes to four states. alaska comes in for $37 billion. texas. $33 billion. california. $22 billion. and louisiana. $14 billion. what does that permit. think of this. texas. a state that is running a surplus currently. with personal income tax. as i understand it. is going to have $3.3 billion a year in the next 10 years. that will permit texas to offer untold advantages. privileges. inducements to anybody who will come down there and relocate. a further exasperating and exacerbating factor is that the revenue sharing. which is very limitedit is set. it gets biggerthat the distribution of the revenue sharing among the various states is based upon the tax efforts of the various states. so a state such as louisianalisten to thiswhich has  done anything different from what they have been doing. because of deregulation. has its 121/2 percent on the oil that is produced there go up double. when you go from $13 a barrel to $26. their tax revenues are doubled. and that is viewed as a doubling of their tax effort. so  only do they get the $13 billion over 10 years. but also. if you can believe it. they get a bigger slice of the revenue sharing pie. i can believe that that is what we want to see happen.
i k california welcomes them and it will be in a better position to welcome them with the substantial bait that comes from this windfall profit tax as i recall it. and i do recall it correctly. is some $22 billion in the course of the next 10 years. that amounts to $2 billion a year. californias budget. i suppose. annually is something like $9 or $10 billion. so we have 20 percent of that budget suddenly coming pouring in from unexpected sources. i come from a section of the country that is very vulnerable to such inducements. we are in a highenergy area. it is cold. it is  the most modern area as far as manufacturing capacity goes. and unfortunately. sometimes. our industrialists do look with yearning to the sunny climes of california. florida is bad egh. they are all going to florida. retiring there. moving their plants there. i ask my distinguished colleague from missouri if he does  see this  just as of deep concern to the nation as a wholethat is. the other 46 statesbut will it  probably be concentrated in the areas that are suffering most . that have the highest unemployment. as he views the situation.
in other words. if an independent is exempt for the first thousand barrels and the base price is $13. the senator has objection to the state continuing its tax on the first $13 a barrel. but the senator says that if the additional amount. the difference between the $13 and the world price. is to be exempt from federal taxes. then it will be exempt from the states severance tax.
i wonder if the senator from arizona would respond briefly to this question. on this side. there was a problem that came up in that the opposition of the senator from connecticut to this proposal was  ed in time. and thus the amendment was proceeded with under limitation. my question of the senator from arizona is. while i am sympathetic to his amendment. at the same time i think the senator from connecticut has a good point. and apparently in the hearings that the senator from arizona conducted. the opposition was  heard. it seems to me that this is a matter that ought to come up in due course.  tagged on to a windfall profit tax bill. what would prevent its coming up in the regular order of business. rapidly. when we reconvene next year.
well. i can just say that is terribly discouraging. and i will be watching this construction contract for that mammoth causeway from saudi arabia to bahrain. formerly the u.s. contractors would have had a wonderful chance at obtaining that project. famous contractors. like mk from the distinguished senator from idahos own state. have done magnificent work all over the world. we have all seen such examples. i just hope they get that contract. whether they will or  i do  k. but if they do. i am sure it will  be like the old days. they will  have innumerable americans working on the job. they just can afford to pay the salaries plus the taxes that have to go on top of that in order to take care of this taxatioamericansabroad provision. i look forward to working with the senator from idaho and the senate export caucus on legislation to do away with disincentives. like taxation of americans working abroad and the foreign corrupt practices act. during the next session of congress. i thank the chair.
. today. the senate will pass h.r. 3091 and h.r. 5224 which extend the tax deduction for state legislator travel expenses through 1981. in its past enforcement of this provision. the internal revenue service has eliminated the deduction in several states which do  meet certain rules it has devised. as a member of the finance committee which has jurisdiction over this legislation. i believe the record should show there is congressional intent that this deduction should be denied to any legislator for the time he or she spent doing legislative business while the legislature was in session or while his or her presence was required for committee business. the law is clear in this regard and there is congressional intent that would justify any other interpretation.o
. the problem goes far deeper than the relatively few thousand jobs americans are losing overseas. it goes to the hundreds of thousands of jobs americans are losing at home because of billions of dollars of lost orders for u.s.-made materials and equipment. this has resulted for two reasons: one is that we have lost construction contracts overseas because u.s. bids are at least 2 to 3 percent higher than our competitors simply from tax costs on american employees. in this situation there is a direct loss of exports in materials that would have been used on the job. the other reason is that americans overseas tend to order americanmade goods. while swiss managers. or germans. or the british. tend to order equipment they. too. are familiar with from their own country. and as i have said. we are seeing fewer americans in these key positions. a gao report suggests that the united states may be losing $7 billion worth of exports a year solely as a result of our tax policies regarding americans overseas. and what does the treasury gain. a maximum $300 million in tax revenue paid by americans working abroad. i think my colleagues would agree that this is  a remotely reasonable tradeoff. while my bill. s. 2283. does  exempt expatriates from all u.s. taxes. i believe it will go a long way toward putting americans back on equal footing with their foreign competitors. and that is all we need. i would urge my colleagues to give this matter a great deal of thought so we might correct this damaging tax policy. i ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the record at this point.
. i thank the senator from delaware. i enthusiastically support the efforts that he is undertaking in this particular area of reducing the budget and making that the single focal point in which we are trying to attack this vicious evilinflation. i thank the senator for the leadership he is giving.
. i am pleased to cosponsor senate concurrent resolution 82. a resolution which expresses the sense of the congress that this years automatic costofliving increase in social security benefits should be allowed to occur as scheduled on june 1. 1980. the purpose for this resolution is clear: we want to assure the 35 million americans receiving social security benefits that they will receive the full 13 percent costofliving increase on june 1. 1980. as  scheduled in the law. some have suggested that the consumer price index. which measures price changes of goods and services. overestimates the true rate of inflation. therefore. social security recipients whose benefits are adjusted annually by the consumer price index are overcompensated for inflation. proposals have been made to revise the consumer price index or adjust benefits for only a portion of the increase. in either case. the likely result would be reduced benefits. i am opposed to these proposals. to balance the budget by significantly reducing retirees benefits will place too great a burden on those who are least able to adjust to inflation. that is. older persons living on fixed incomes. while prices rose an average of 13.3 percent last year. prices of items which dominate the budgets of most older personsfood. fuel. housing. and medical carerose nearly 18 percent. inflation is especially onerous to persons with fixed incomes. reducing or adjusting inflation protection they  enjoy will make it even more difficult for retirees to maintain a decent standard of living. retired persons are already biting the bulletwe just can ask them to bite the bullet any harder. as a member of the finance committee. which has jurisdiction over the social security program. i am pleased to add my name as a cosponsor of this resolution. the senate should act quickly on this matter to assure the millions of americans. who depend on social security benefits. that they will receive the full cost of living adjustment in june.
yes. question about that. i just want to clear up the point you were asking about before. i will just read again what i said on that particular point. the house report on the first budget resolution also recommends the adoption of the withholding proposal. likewise. the senate budget committee suggests withholding among several revenueraising possibilities. so the senator is right that the senate budget committee did  recommend it. it suggested it on page 24 of the first budget resolution from the senate. it says: the administrations cash management initiatives and its proposal to withhold taxes on interest and dividends were discussed as possible parts of the revenue raising legislation. so i did . in my remarks. say that the senate budget committee had recommended it. i said in my remarks that the senate budget committee suggested withholding. among several revenueraising possibilities.
. what i am saying is that just last month we passed legislation which exempted the first $200 from interest or dividends from taxation completely. $400 for a married couple. we did that with the purpose of encouraging savings and investment. . after doing that. we are turning around and saying. for the first time in the history of the country: "lets withhold that interest and dividend. the possible tax there might be on it." even though the statistics show that the great majority of those savings are very. very small and that already there is a system for tracking down whether the taxpayer has paid his tax. as the senator from nebraska ks. a taxpayer must anticipate what his total tax will be for the year and pay that tax. either through his withholding or through his prepayment. so that he will have met his total tax burden at the end of the year. what i am saying is that it makes sense . in an era when we are trying to encourage savings. to put this burden. which will fall essentially on the small taxpayer who will  owe the tax at the end.
. this amendment which i have sent to the desk would eliminate the additional funding for this year. fiscal year 1980. that is included for the tennesseetombigbee waterway project in mississippi and alabama. may i review the bidding a minute.
.  benign neglect. yet. the carter administration continues to balk at positive action toward resolving these problems. it is said that an individual tax cut would be too stimulative. too inflationary8 billion tax cut will offset less than half the $42 billion tax increase americans can expect in 1981 from inflation. rising social security taxes and windfall profit taxes. we are  exactly plucking the drowning taxpayer out of the water. it is more like throwing him a life preserver. on the other hand. it is accurate to say that the businessrelated tax provisions in my proposal would be stimulative. but who would argue about the need to increase our level of productive business investment to create jobs and buy more efficient tools for our workers. who could disagree about the need to provide tax relief to small businesses. the primary source of new employment in this country. and who would shun the opportunity to increase u.s. exports. the commerce department estimates that every $1 billion of new exports creates a minimum 40.000 jobs. the provisions in my bill would address these important issues. and they are the very issues that must be solved if we are to cut the underlying rate of inflation and regain our strength among trading nations. i sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in placing constructive and effective tax reduction at the top of the senates priority list this year. positive action must be taken .  bandied about as just aher campaign promise.o by mr. warner:
. the proposal i make today is important  only to my state of rhode island. but to many others in the industrialized theast and midwest regions. those states  in debt include: connecticut delaware d.c. illis maine massachusetts michigan minnesota................... montana new jersey pennsylvania puerto r ico ----------------------rhode island million $370.9 44.4 65.5 946.5 36. 4 231.7 330.0 1.9 7.1 651.9 1.390.4 88.7 121.2 vermont -----------------------40.7 virgin islands --------------------- 8.9 according to current ecoic estintes. at least 18 states are expected t3 borrow over the next 2 years. including 4 states  currently in debt (arkansas. virginia. west virginia. and new york). this bill is a reasonable. fair and straightforward way to lesscn the impact of escalating taxes on states which are already hard hit by ecoic downturns. . urge the speedy adopting of this bill. by mr. nelson (for himself. mr.
well. the senator will have plenty of time. i am deeply concerned. . that the senate is being asked to spend $208 million on only the first portion of a project which ultimately will cost $3 billion and probably more. the commitment of this money we are making today. if we make it. will lock us into yearly appropriations in excess of $200 million for each of the remaining years of the 1980s. my conclusion that this is a $3 billion project whose scope is twice that originally authorized is based on the official documents provided this congress by the corps of engineers. which is currently constructing the project. first. let me say that i join in the highest esteem in which the corps of engineers is held by all in this chamber. i read with some interest the senate hearings before the committee on appropriations in which high tribute was paid to general morris and that is deservedly so. i k general morris associate. general ellis. he was good egh to come with me last sunday. we spent an excellent day with general ellis and colonel ryan. they are all top ch. they are doing their job and they are doing it in an absolutely outstanding fashion. so whatever we say today on the floor of this senate in criticism of this project is  criticism of the corps of engineers. which is one of the great prides of the u.s. military services. and justifiably so. budget data submitted by the corps during january this year shows quite clearly that the tenntom consists of an "initial" project with a price tag of $1.9 billion and an "ultimate" project with a price tag of over $3 billion. according to the corps figures. about $868 million has already been spent. less than half of the cost of the initial project and less than onethird the cost of the ultimate project. we will hear bandied about on the floor of the senate today. and i heard it last evening. that 70 percent of the funds have already been committed. do  stop . i do  k whoever came up with that 70 percent figure because in the testimony before the committee on appropriations. if one looks in that material. on page 7. general morris testified: at this point in time we have actually spent on this project $805 million. we have obligated $867 million through july 31. i do  k how you can have any more current figure than that. then he goes on to talk about the remaining costbenefit ratio. and so forth.
. if a firstcome. first. - serve procedure is used during fiscal yea: 1981. there is a good possibility somi states will be unable to obligate fund - quickly egh before the collective ob ligation ceiling is reached. after octobe 1. 1980. states will have apportionment: available totaling over $15 billion with ar obligational limitation for fiscal 198] somewhere around $8.4 billion. rhod island is a state which could potentiall3 be adversely affected if funds are obligated on a firstcome. firstserve basis for a variety of reasons it has. in the past. been a slow obligating state. this allocation formula contained in this amendment will allow states like rhode island to carefully plan their highway priorities throughout the fiscal year.
. because if it does . i am afraid we will  see final passage of a tax cut package for 6 to 9 months. even if such a delayed tax bill were made retroactive effective january 1. 1981. american taxpayers would be unable to make accurate financial plans or project the real costs of making much needed new investments next year. for these compelling reasons. i will cast my vote in favor of taking up the tax reduction act and urge all my colleagues to do the same.
. i believe that we have higher priority than assuring that all americans have the opportunity for the best possible education. the future progress of any nation depends on a welleducated population. one can dispute the importance of a solid base of federal support for higher education. but i believe we can assure needed support for postsecondary education. and still live within the budget which the congress has set for itself. even though we may  all agree with every provision of this bill. i believe it is a fair and equitable compromise which balances many diverse views and opinions. it continues the many valuable programs which assist institutions of higher education. and provides financial aid to many students. at the same time. it is consistent with the budget which the congress has previously approved. i believe it deserves the support of the senate. and hope my colleagues will vote for its passage.
. i have great trouble with this amendment. it seems to me that the people can get some satisfaction in voting for a cap. but if we really want to get at the problems of the program that are suggested to existand i am  espousing an argument that there are  all kinds of problems in the program. it is expensive. and it is expensive because there appear to be a lot of poor people out there in americathen let us vote on the criteria. let us vote. have a vote. on who is eligible. should such and such a person be eligible. we have had such votes here in the past. we voted 2 years ago. i believe. that there would  be any cash payment required for the stamps. we voted in connection with students. and we have had all sorts of votes. and i think that is the correct way to proceed. but i do  think it is correct to proceed with this cap business. which can only cause trouble. cause misery. for those who are eligible under the present criteria. and who will lose out in the closing months of the fiscal year when there is more money but the people are still -there. . one of the problems that is raised is in january of this year there will be an 11percent costofliving increase for the beneficiaries of the program. i am  sure that that has been taken into consideration in this cap. but i am just opposed to this business of placing a cap on what is. in fact. an entitlement program. and let us get to the entitlement part if we so choose. but  proceed in this manner.
. i also want to express my deep appreciation to senator long and senator dole for their tireless efforts to bring this legislation to a vote in the senate and their assistance in obtaining interim extensions of the 1979 tax return filing deadline for those americans this bill benefits. i thank my colleagues for their support.
. this provision has been approved by the finance committee and it has the support of the treasury department. the revenue loss is expected to be minimal more than $200.000 if all the eligible landowners elect to defer their capital gains taxes by reinvesting in other property. i thank my colleagues for their support.0
. the bill i introduce today is extremely important to my state of rhode island as well as 15 other states. located in the industrialized theast and midwest regions. those states  in debt include: connecticut. delaware. district of columbia. illis. maine. massachusetts. michigan. minnesota. montana. new jersey. pennsylvania. puerto rico. vermont and the virgin islands. the unemployment compensation tax cap is a reasonable. fair and straightforward way to protect jobs and industry in these states. i urge speedy enactment of this bill.*
. i welcome all my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this measure with me. the issue at stake is  simply cleaning up a messy provision of the internal revenue code: it is removing a significant u.s. export disincentive so we can expand our commercial efforts overseas and provid jobs to american workers here at hon i. i ask that the text of s. 408 co printed at this point in the record.
madam president. today i am pleased to join my colleagues on the senate finance committee in introducing the reagan administration tax cut bill. president reagan is absolutely correct in calling for substantial tax reductions beginning this year. coupled with a major reduction in the rate of government spending growth. a wellstructured tax cut will be.the key to reviving ecoic productivity. reducing unemployment. and. most importantly. bringing inflation under control. like many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. i have differences with some aspects of the administrations proposal. i have serious doubts. for example. about the wisdom of enacting 3 successive years of individual income tax cuts at 10 percent per year. i.firmly believe that a savings incentive should be included to increase personal savings and help make more capital available for mortgages and business investment. and i want to take a close look at the depreciation revisions to assure that these investment incentives are well balanced. differences aside. the most important point is that by introducing this tax cut bill. we are starting the ball rolling toward enactment of a major tax bill this year. i will be iworking closely with the president and his advisers to deliver the american people a much needed tax relief measure.
i just want to get the record straight. . the distinguished senator from wisconsin has been constantly saying that every federal agency is in support of this. constantly citing the federal reserve board. let us see what mrs. teeters. who came before the committee when the senator from wisconsin was there. said. i said: and yet. you are saying by law you are goingyou were going to restrict cash discounts to 5 percent. which in your own testimony you say hasnt worked. and at the same time. you are going to permit the merchant to impose a surcharge on the customer.
. this legislation is ecoically sound. fiscally. responsible and absolutely necessary. it is one more positive step toward scaling down government costs and reducing the federal budget deficit as we continue to wage our war on inflation.
i thank the senator. . i say to members here that if this spro amendment addon for $1.5 billion passes that reduces the chances it seems to me for the addons that i have proposed. and i personally feel that we can get along without the additions to spro. to the strategic petroleum oil reserves. that have been suggested and feel that these items that i have proposed in this package along with my chief cosponsor. senator heinz of pennsylvania. are more important to the citizens of our country in the fiscal year 1982 and the fiscal year 1983. so i urge my colleagues to reject the amendment proposed by the senior sen. ator from alaska. i wish to thank the lady senator fror kansas for allowing me this opportunity
. on february 5 of this year. i introduced s. 408 e to reduce and simplify the taxation of e americans working overseas. this bill will help put americaie workers back on even ground with their foreign comd petitors by changing sections 011 and s 913 of the internal revenue code. s because the original printing of 8. 408 contained three drafting errors. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be reprinted with the corrections i am  sending to the desk. i also request that the names of the cosponsors be included on this star print: senators tsongas.
. it is important to e that this legislation has a strong bipartisan group of sponsors. it is very similar to a proposal i made last year which was adopted by the finance committee. also with bipartisan support. our bill includes the following provisions: an exclusion from u.s. tax for the first $50.000 plus half of the next $50.000 of earned income. the maximum exclusion. therefore. would be $75.000. an exclusion from u.s. tax for housing allowances or costs which exceed 16% percent of the salary of a gs14 step 1. in 1981. this would exclude foreign housing costs which exceed $5.785. a residency requirement reduced to 11 out of any 12 consecutive months. the current residency requirement is 17 out of 18 months and must include a full tax year. and repeal of the complex and confusing costofliving deductions under section 913 of the code. current tax policy affecting americans who work abroad continues to plague our efforts to increase u.s. exports. it is becoming more widely understood in congress that our tax laws must be changed if u.s. companies. which employ americans in their foreign operations. are to remain competitive in the world market. the task of strengthening u.s. export policy and improving the competitive position of u.s. industry is simply  a partisan issue. it is a matter of national interest. better explanation of the current problem and more compelling argument for correcting it has been put forth than by the general accounting office in its february 27. 1981. report titled. "american employment abroad discouraged by u.s. income tax laws." for those of my colleagues who have  had a chance to study the gao findings. i ask unanimous cofisent that a brief digest of the report be printed in the record following my remarks.
finally. . i am happy to annce that the finance subcommittee on taxation and debt management will be conducting a hearing on our bill later this month. on april 24. we urge all our colleagues to join us in seeking removal of this export disincentive from the tax code this year. there is reason to delay any further
. today i am introducing. at the request of the administration. its proposed legislative reforms to the construction grants program of the clean water act. although i can support all of the pieces of the reform package. i agree with the message it conveys. the construction grants program lacks a focus and has raised expectations unrealistically high that the federal government will commit to it $100 billion. those kinds of fiscal resources simply are  available. the highlights of the proposed amendments are: limiting fundfug to secondary or advanced secondary. or any cost effective alternative thereof and interceptor source. and to meet backlog needs only: eliminating liability for future reimbursement of projects constructed without federal funds. allowing states discretion as to whether they will set aside for rural. inative. or alternative projects. and expanding the authority of a gover to lower . the federal share allocated to categories of projects: tying states administration grants to actual workload of the state program as reflected by uligated funds. requiring that orojects included ohi a states priority list result in significant water auality benefits. particularly in areas of large urban. industrial concentrations. and revising the allotment formula to reflect only the actual treatmeit needs of each state. this package of amendments is clearly an initial step in the legislation process that we expect to have completed by the end of september. as many of you k. the administration has already requested a rescission of $1.7 billion of uligated funds which have been appropriated since 1977 and the total elimination of budget authority for next year. this body is  on record in support of that action. although this is drastic action. it is necessary. currently the states have available to them approximately $2.5 billion. this is more than egh to carry the program forward while we work on the necessary reforms. after enactment of these reforms. the administration has committed to request $2.4 billion for 1982 to keep up the momentum that has built upon the program. the construction grants program has been beset by difficulties from its very beginning. it has been marked by delays. impoundments. and various moratoriums on funding so that the single. most crucial needstabilityhas been missing in the program. the states originally were  effectively staffed and were. in effect. drowning in federal dollars.  the states arpear to be in a position to use the funds that we appropriate efficiently. indeed. we have come full circle. since the federal water pollution control act was passed in 1972. congress has authorized $44 billion and appropriated $35 billion to assist states in the construction of treatment facilities. the states have obligated $29 billion to approximately 17.000 projects nationwide. this is a significant public works program. second only to our interstate highway program. but. as everyone agrees. times are changing. and we need to reassess the strategy by which we are going to achieve the goals of the clean water act. the environmental pollution and resource protection subcommittee. of which i am chairman. will be scheduling hearings in early summer on changes in the program. because of the need to work within the budget process .and move quickly. these hearings will focus only on the construction grants program. later this year and early next year. we will address the rest of the act through both oversight and legislative hearings. while the administrations requested amendments are useful for focusing discussion. it is necessary for me to take exception to parts of them. the first exception i have is with the total elimination of eligibility for federal funding of the control and treatment of combined sewer overflows. first and foremost. the construction grants program is a water quality program. such an inflexible approach may  address true water quality needs. in some areas of the country. municipal treatment works receive and have to treat waste flows from combined sewers. many of these plants need upgrading in order to treat flows that occur during periods of heavy rainfall when the combined sewer flows are beyond plant capacity and are simply bypassed into receiving water. providing only for secondary treatment at these plants is almost throwing money away. during our hearings. we will take testimony on the need to preserve some flexibility for the administrator to be able to deal with these special water quality problems as the need dictates. this problem is most significant in areas where waste is discharged into ecologically fragile bays and estuaries. the other exception i have is with the section that would repeal the administrators authority to reimburse states and localities that move forward with projects on their own in order to get a jump on inflation. during the past several congresses. i have worked on behalf of rhode island to enable my state to move ahead with a needed upgrading of the treatment plant at provicence. i sponsored an amendment. enacted last year. to enable states like rhode island to begin needed work and be reimbursed for it. but only after they were certified to do so by the administrator. other safeguards were also built into that prograii so that the federal government was  exposed to undue risks. future outlays would be managed by the administrator carefully. this provision is only used when the administrator feels that it is in the interest of water quality and fiscal integrity to do so. it is  openended. i simply tan support efforts to repeal it. later this session. i will offer my own suggestions on the municipal wastewater program which will focus on providing stability to the program and determining its future direction. at this point in the record. i want to include a sectionbysection analysis of the proposals. the environmental pollution and resource protection subcommittee will be holding hearings soon to make sure that the $2.4 billion. which will be requested by the administration when reforms are enacted. will be available in the next fiscal year.
. while i will vote for the resolution. i must express my deep regret about the funding level for function 500education. training. employment. and social services. the senate passed budget resolution called for the fiscal year 1982 budget level in function 500 to be $26.2 billion in budget authority and $26.85 billion in budget outlays. while this may seem like a great deal of money. i am  confident that it will allow for adequate funding of education programsespecially for the elementary and secondary education programs. the budget level for function 500 in the conference report before us is $600 million in budget authority less and $550 million in outlays less than the senate agreed to. when the senate considered the reconciliation bill. senate resolution 9. in march of this year. i offered an amendment to restore funds to a number of programs. including the elementary and secondary education program. although my amendment had significant support. it failed to pass the senate. i am hopeful that this interest and support will be reflected when final funding decisions for the elementary and secondary education program are made later this year. the budget figures we are considering today are targets for spending in broad areas. withstanding the spending targets included in this bill for function 500including educationi hope that the elementary and secondary education program will be funded at a level which will present the least disruption in services in our schools and the most help for our young people.*
 reagans goal that the federal exposure in this program should be reduced gradually over time. these amendments do that by anticipating the completion of this program and reducing federal share. states that have operated under the illusion that all projects will eventually be completed will have to make difficult choices about which projects will receive priority. it may  be easy. but it will be necessary. what we accomplish this year will set the tone for the next decade. my goal is to trim the program. but at the same time make certain that whatever budget trimming is done also improves our nations water quality. these amendments. if enacted. will greatly address both those issues. hearings are scheduled in june. and we expect to complete action on this program by the end of this fiscal year in order to have appropriations for fiscal year 1982 in place so that states and local governments can plan accordingly. at this point i would ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the record.
. on march 26. 1981. the acting administrator of the environmental protection agency requested an additional $2 million in fiscal year 1982 to carry out the functions under section 111 of the marine protection. research. and sanctuaries act. in documents submitted to the committee on environment and public works to support this request. the agency indicated the increased authorization was necessary to continue the programs authorized by title i. to meet the agencys obligation under a stipulation agreement and to establish and implement plans to phase out the dumping of sewage sludge and industrial waste in ocean waters prior to january 1. 1982. as required by public law 96572. 1 title i of the marine protection. research. and sanctuaries act. regulates the transportation and disposal of materials in the ocean. as part of the title i program. the environmental protection agency reviews ocean dumping permit applications and. where appropriate. issues special. general research. or emergency permits. the agency also reviews permit applications for the disposal of dredged material. and evaluates and acts on waiver requests by the army corpsof engineers. the program evaluates potential and current dumping sites and designates dumpsites for specific discharges. the vast majority of the sites designated are for the disposal of dredged material. although sites for other materials are assessed and designated where appropriate. finally. in implementing title i. the agency participates in the international ocean dumping convention. this bill increases the existing fiscal year 1982 authorization to support the programs under this title. the primary focus of the program sup. ported by this increased authorization is the evaluation and designation of ocean dumping sites for the disposal of dredged material. the corps has indicated a continuous and growing need for such sites. and the environmental protection agency has the responsibility  only to designate new sites as required. but to evaluate on a regular basis the impacts of all sites currently in use. this requires field studies and analyses of areas of the ocean which are  currently used for ocean dumping but which are potential ocean dumping sites. as well as of areas which are currently used. or have been used in the past. as either interim or final sites for dredged material. s. 1213. which the committee ordered reported by a unanimous voice vote on may 11. provides increased authorization for title i of the marine protection. research and sanctuaries act. as requested by the administration. in the amount of $2.000.000. this makes the total authorization for fiscal year 1982 $4.218.000. the committee did  extend the authority for title i beyond fiscal year 1982. the bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading. read the third time. and passed. as follows: be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that section 111 of the marine protection. research. and sanctuaries act. as amended (33 u.s.c. 1420). is amended by striking "and fiscal year 1982." and inserting in lieu thereof "and  to exceed $4.213.000 for fiscal year 1082.".
dr. jack ewalt. the vas director of mental health and behavioral sciences. testified recently that hing had changed his view. expressed during the committees january 25. 1979. hearing on the original enabling legislation. that a 5year eligibility period was needed. extending the application period 1 year longer than the veterans affairs committee has recommended is estimated by the congressional budget office to cost only $26.9 million in fiscal year 1984. a very modest sum in comparison to. the benefits that this program provides. in my judgment. the readjustment counseling program has been well received by both vietnamera veterans and the communities in which vet centers are located. the program is a visible and meaningful symbol of our determination to provide assistance to those vietnamera veterans who still need help. at a time when the military is plagued with manpower problems. and the allvolunteer force is facing increasing challenges in recruiting adequate numbers of quallfled personnel. we must meet our obligations to the veterans of the last war. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes to a vote. exmiarr i
the senator from louisiana. who has as much experience on taxes as anybody else in this chamber. is absolutely right. as inflation goes up. what do we do. we have tax cut after tax cut. and that is what put us in this problem we are in today.
the senator could  be more right. if there are to be tax cuts. as we are doing here. in these times of inflation. they have to be tax cuts that are targeted in a particular direction the tax cuts we are enacting under this bill are targeted toward industrial recovery. that is why in the finance committee. and indeed on the floor of the senate. we will make every attempt to fighz off a whole host of amendments to this bill. because this tax bill we are considering is targeted. but this proposal. this wildeyed scheme that was presented to the senate today. does hing such as that. the worse inflation gets. the greater the tax cuts are.
i could  agree with the senator more. here in these past 5 months. . we have made sincere eff orts to meet this problem head on and we have approached it. in my judgment. in absolutely the right manner. we are trying to cut the budget or reduce the rate of increase in the budget. we are trying to hold down spending. our tax cuts are targeted tax cuts in order to improve the industrial competitive position of this nation. we have resisted all sorts of panaceas that have been proposed to uts. but to adopt this proposal. with hearings on it. a proposal that certainly is attractiveindexing is always attractiveleads us in exactly the wrong direction. i urge my colleagues to vote " on the amendment.
if you want to ellmlnate oil. obviously. japan has done way better than we have in exports. but the distressing part is that the united states. for the first time in its history. in 1978 experienced a deficit in manufactured goods balance of payments. in other words. this great manufacturing nation of ours imported more manufactured goods for the first time in its history in 1978 and that increased in 1979 and increased in 1980.
the reason that this measure was adopted is that in testimony after testimony. witness after witness. it was pointed out that since the measures that were passed in 1978. which applied the full u.s. tax to americans working abroad. what american companies have done rather than compensate the american with additional moneys for the taxes that were  imposed on him for serving indo  choose london and paris because they are subject to the domestic taxes anywaywhat we might truly call hardship posts. i mentioned amman. i mentioned iran. nigeria. wvherever it might be. maybe it is  right. but americans just will  go there without additional compensation: this has clearly been documented in hearings and in visits that  only i made but the distinguished senator from texas. senator bentstn. held similar hearings in the far east. as did senator roth. it clearly came home. the fact that american companies. rather than have this added expense which would lose them a competitive edge. instead of sending americans abroad. would send canadians. citizens of the united kingdom. west germans. swiss. swedes. whatever they were. but worse than losing the job or just as bad as losing the american job. we also lost the orders that an american in that position would send home. again that was documented. this is particularly so in the construction cases. what happens when you have a canadian there in a top position or a west german. it is  because these people are antiamerican but because they are used to the equipment from their own countries. they k its performance. they k the delivery schedules can be met. they tend to order that type of equipment from their own home countries. the testimony was absolutely dayastating on the lost orders that the united states was experiencing. the chase ecoetric study mentioned by the senator was  relied upon by me. in my own judgment. that went too far. i viewed that with a grain of salt. we had testimony from a host of other witnesses. on that basis. we acted very wisely. in my judgment. i might say many of the senators wanted to go further. as i mentioned. the house exempts the first $75.000 and we exempted $50.000. maybe we ought to do more. it was pointed out that this covered. i think they said. 75 percent of the americans working abroad. the other point. from a revenue viewpoint. was raised by the treasury. in which they said if we exempted all earned income. if we had limitation. never mind $50.000. never mind $75.000. but if we exempted it all. the total loss to the treasury was $700 million. currently under the law as it is on the books. which the senator from wisconsin mentioned previously. the deductions total $400 million.
. i appreciate the views of the senator from wisconsin. and i k he isvery sincere. july .18. 19 81 he has voiced his views on this floor many times when we have debated this measure and its predecessors. however. what we- are trying to do is increase opportunities for americans. the present tax poicies have resulted in the loss of jobs. and these jobs have gone to canadians. germans. french. britainswhatever they might be. this is confirmed by the gao study. the way to reverse this is to do as suggested in this measure. i do  consider it a giveaway. as a matter of fact. until 1960. we had a $20.000 exemption. when $20.000. 1 suppose. was equal to $60.000 . so the results of the act we changed in 1978 1 consider to be disastrous. and this will remedy it. we hope.
. i shall also add something if i might to that. the rule of thumb is that $1 billion of exports creates 40.000 jobs in the united states. one billion dollars of exports we gain or we lose equates into .40.000 jobs. what this measure does is. as i pointed out.  only gets jobs for americans abroad hopefully but also in the orders that those americans place home is a tremendously important part of this whole equation. so that is one of the great pluses that comes out of it. in both the chase ecoetric study. that the senator from wisconsin mentioned. which i do  completely subscribe to. and in the gao study. it says that by having more americans abroad we will increase jobs at home.
sure. there is n6 question about that. so an aimerican might. as the senator from wisconsin suggested. be working for toyota in japan. but in the testimony we had it was the american companies that were trying to stem the loss of american jobs abroad that they were principally talking about. and frankly i do  want to be overly optimistic about this. i have some worries whether indeed we are going to be able to reverse it. it is going to take a while.  these companies have hired these canadians and brits. or whatever it might be. and i do  en:pect they are going to turn around and fire them all and replace them with an american. but at least we can stop the exodus of the americans from these jobs and then come back. but we will  come back right away. we suff ered a big loss.
. the passage of this tax bill will be a historic occasionhistoric because it is the largest tax cut in american history and because it signals a fundamental change in the way the federal government conducts its business. but i do  rise on this occasion to preach the virtues of what we are about to do. i wish. instead. to take this time to ackledge the initiative. the leadership. and the responsiveness which senator roth has shown as the architect of the ecoic recovery act of a little over 4 years ago. hie introduced legislation that is the foundation of the tax bill we are considering today. since then. my distinguished colleague from delaware has worked relentlessly to build a national consensus for a tax cut that would provide real relief for the american taxpayer. from the beginning. and despite early opposition. senator roth has responded to the clear needs of the overburdened taxpayer and our struggling ecoy. as a result. the nation can  look forward to relief from higher taxes. excessive government spending. and uncontrolled inflation.
. i ask unanimous consent that we might make one mi correction in the tax measure. those of us on the finance committee who are present will recall that it dealt with the effective date of t he capital gains provision. it will be recalled that we agreed that it would be as of that date. june 10. we looked up at the clock. i believe that the distinguished senior senator from virginia and the chairman of the committee will recall that we said. "as of . the capital gains rate takes effect." that was for some peculiar reason. under the writeup of the measure. it provides that it is effective as of june 11. at 1 a.m.. or the start of the day of june 11.. it is  a mammoth point. but it seems to me that we did sa agree in committee. so i ask unanimous consent that transactions as of june 10. which was what we all agreed to. will be the effective date for capital gains treatmentthat is. for the reduction from 70 to 50 percent.
. i wish to express my concern that we were unable to include funds in this bill for the section 201 wastewater construction grants program in fiscal year 1982. as my good friend the senator from utah ks. a cutoff in funding for this program would have a devastating impact. particularly on cities already under court order and on projects already under construction. i k that the chairman has already brought his concerns to the attention of the appropriations committee members so that they are aware of this need. the committee is. understandably. reluctant to act in the absence of reform legislation for the program and assurances that such funding would be within the ceiling set by the senate budget committee in the second budget resolution.
as the senator from utah ks. the environmental pollution subcommittee has sent to the full committee on environment and public works legislation to reform the construction grants program. i anticipate that a full committee markup will occur immediately after the august recess. with floor action to follow shortly thereafter. i have discussed this matter with the chairman of the budget committee in the past and ask at this time for further clarification of this matter. if this reform bill is  acted upon by the full senate by september 15. will this preclude the budget committee from considering inclusion or budget authority of $2.4 allion for the program in the second loncurrent budget resolution.
. between  and 1986. it will cost the taxpayers almost $12 billion to grant these favors to the owners and producers of americas oil. what is most distressing is that these favors. have been handed out so easily and so soon after cuts in many social programs were made with such difficulty. while i am disappointed that these oil giveaways have found their way into the ecoic recovery tax act. i believe strongly that the overall legislation is very important and should be enacted without delay. a billion dollars taken in any context is obviously a lot of money. but $12 billion for oil in the context of a $700 billion total package will have to be accepted so we can get on with the ecoic recovery program.*
i thank the senior senator from utah. . under present law a deduction is allowable to an employer for a tangible item of personal property. such as a watch or a service emblem. that is awarded to an employee in recognition of length of service or safety achievement. but only if1 the cast of the item does  exceed $100. such items are awarded to motivate employees. cement employment relations. recognize loyalty. employment longevity. or achievement. or for other purposes of the employer. change has been made in the dollar limit for such deductions since 1962. however. and during that time the consumer price index has nearly tripled and the price of gold. silver. and other basic raw materials has gone up more than 1.000 percent. unless this 20yearold ceiling of existing law were raised. it would continue to impose an outmoded and unrealistic restriction upon the recognition of employee loyalty and achievement. furthermore. under current law deduction is allowable for any item if the cost of it exceeds $100. and provision currently exists for productivity awards. finally. altaough such awards are often made as part of a broadbased plan which recognizes achievement without regard to compensation levelsfor example. by recognizing service with increasingly attractive awards at 5year intervals with the most meaningful award. frequently a gold watch. at retirementdeductions for recognition awards can currently be taken on an average cost. planwide basis. the measure that was introduced in the senate by the distinguished senior senator from utah. and that i cosponsored. would resolve these problems. under that amendment (up  325). first. the per item deduction limit would be raised from $100 to $400. as thus amended. the code would continue to impose a reasonable dollar limit on recognition awards. but it would also at least partially recognize the increased cost of materials used in the manufacture of such awards. second. the amendment would allow a deduction for the first $400 of each item even if the cost of that item exceeded $400. this removes an unintended technical problem under prior law. third. the amendment would allow the per item cost of awards to be computed on a planwide. average cost basis. as long as the plan doev  discriminate in eligibility or benefits in favor of offcers. shareholders. or highly compensated employees. this provision recognizes that average cost is the logical and reasonable way to calculate the deduction limits when a broadbased. discriminatory plan is involved. in addition. to prevent any possibility of abuse. deduction will be allowed. even on a planwide basis. for that portion of any award that exceeds $1.600. finally. the amendment would allow deductions for productivity awards as well as length of service and safety achievement awards. this addition is consistent with the overall purpose of the ecoic recovery tax act of 4981. for it will make it possible to provide meaningful. tangible incentives for icreased productivity. such as efficiency. attendance. and achieving goals.
. we take this opportunity to reassure both the purchasers and manufacturers of energy equipment qualifying for the various tax credits that they may proceed with their investment plans with the certainty that congress will stand behind these tax incentives. at this point. i would like the record to show that the following senators are firmly in support of the existing energy tax credits: mr. chafee. mr. matsunaga.
. i support senator wzrckeas amendment to add $200 million to the lowincome fuel assistance program. the administration has proposed a budget of $1a4 billion for the program and the senate has proposed $1.65 bilion as compared to the funding level in fiscal year 1981 which was $1.85 bilion. as a cosponsor of the weicker amendment. i want to express my concern about the adverse consequences of cutting the program funding below the fiscal year 1981 level. in my own state of rhlode island. the program provided assistance to nearly 30.000 households this year. the number of eligible households is expected to rise to nearly 34.000 in the next year. if the administration figure is finally approved. rhode islands share of program money will drop from $12.4 million. which is the amount received in 1981. to $8.4 million. if the senate figure is adopted. the states share will drop to approximately $9 million. even the selnate figure of $1.65 will have a devastating impact on the states ability to help the truly needy this winter. i realize that if the weicker amendment is adopted. it will put the continuing resolution level nearly $700 million over the administrations september budget request. however. we should  be trying to balance the budget from social programs alone. i urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the weicker amendment.o
. i would like to annce for the information of the senate and the public. the scheduling of public hearings before the consumer affairs subcommittee of the senate committee on banking. housing and urban affairs. the hearings will take place on wednesday. march 3. 1982 beginning at 9:30 a.m.. in room 5302 of thedirksen senate office building. testimony will be received regarding the extent of the federal governiments involvement in the operation of the nations payment systems.over the past decade. the federal reserve system has played a major role in the development of electronic. funds transfer tef1) industry. operating all but one of the nations automated clearinghouses. (achs) as well as the fedwire transfer network. in 1978. the federal reserve established a nationwide linking of the individual automated clearinghouses. the federal reserve is currently in the process. of procuring a new and sophisticated nationwide telecommnunications network to be kn as fr~cs80 (federal reserve communications system for the 80s). growing concern has been expressed about the federal governments increasing operational. as opposed to regulatory. role in the eft marketplace. the subcommittee will examine the impact of the federal reserve service offerings on private sector service providers. depository institutions. and commercial and private consumers. the committee will also explore the costs of the systems being acquired as well as the other costs of providing each of its payments services. and how the explicit pricing of services required by the act will affect the marketplace. for further information regarding the hearings. you may wish to contact annette fribourg at 2242921. those wishing to submit a written statement for the record should write to the committee on banking. housing and urban affairs. room 5300. dirksen senate office building. washington. d.c.
. if i might ask a question. are we  letting the horse out of the barn. what chance do we have to impose any restraints in the program once we have consented to the tax increase. in other words. we have let the inducements. as it were. be granted at this time without imposing the socalled reforms or sufficient reforms. i personally have difficulty understanding it. maybe we should let the program go along and run up these fearful deficits. so that there is at least some incentive to bring us to the table to try to enact some reforms. but if you give the benefits without enacting the reforms. the incentive for the reforms. of course. is gone.
. i support this miscellaneous tax bill reported by the finance committee. and i want to congratulate our chairman. senator dole. for putting together a vackage of provisions. all of which have had hearings and have support of the treasury. occasionally. we have a situation where tax legislation enacted by congress will require conforming amend . ments to the tax code so that consistency in tax policy is maintained. such a situation arose last .year when the small business incentive act of 1980 was reported from the banking committee and passed into law. this legislation created a new. simplified regulatory structure for venture capital firms kn as small business development companies. however. those companies electing to register under this new act will lose their tax deduction for dividends passed through to share-
. the law on the subject of business tax deductions should be neutral. members of congress should enjoy special tax privileges  bear any added burden. having consistently voted with these objectives in mind. i urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support my bill.*
. i have further comnnts. i would like to thank all who have worked on this. i particularly tip my hat to the distinguished senator from alabama. who has worked hard. i express my appreciation to his staff. and to quentin crommelin. the staff director of the senate judiciary committee. i thank the junior senator from washington for the interest he has taken in this matter. he has shown an extraordinary diligence in this. as he has in other matters. i serve on other committees with him and i think it is extraordinary that he is able to devote so much time and constructive effort to various matters. whether it is the budget committee or the clean air act or this act. i would also like to thank the senator from iowa. senator orassley. for his remarks yesterday. in conclusion again i say to that happy warrior from the other side. the senator from delaware. that i have enjoyed this. from it i emerge one luncheon richer than when i started. it has been a pleasure. i would hope that in the future we could be able to blend our talents nd work together on legislation as we have in the past and as i am confident we will in the future.
. the law on the subject of business ttx deductions should be neutral. members of congress should enjoy special tax privileges  bear any added burden. i shall vote for senator specters amendment because. as my own proposal. it puts members of congress on the same footing as every other american taxpayer who has to substantiate business expenses. should it fail. i feel compelled to vote for the armstrong amendment. which restores the standard $3.000 deduction for congressional business expenses. clearly. this is  the best solution to the problem at hand. but it is preferable to the present situation. which permits unsubstantiated deductions of up to $75 a day for each member of congress.
the budget resolution. which we will take up next week. will contain a recommendation for a specific amount of cuts. but the essence of this amendment is that before any binding amounts. changes. or corrective actions are taken. the congress will have the commissions report. furthermoreand i stress thisit leaves us. as individual senators. free to offer amendments to the budget resolution. indeed. this senator might well present an amendment to eliminate the $40 billion.
we make it very clear that any corrective actions taken shall soley be for the preservation of the fund. and that is the important point. more than is required for the preservation of this fund based upon the report of the commission. that is what we have before us today. and which i support. what we do later. whether we amend the budget resolution is a separate matter and. indeed. i shall undoubtedly support something to change the $40 billion.
. today i am introducing the small issue industrial development bond reform act of 1982 which will limit the excesses and abuses of tax exempt financing  allowed under current law. this bill is offered as a replacement for the administrations proposal which puts such severe restrictions on idb financing that i believe it would kill most of the program. senators tsongas. danforth. and heinz are joining in cosponsoring this bipartisan effort. it is based on recommendations of the coalition of theastern govers (coneg) and is strongly supported by the national govers association (nga). the legislation embodies a 6point reform plan to assure the proper and legitimate use of taxexempt industrial development bonds (idbs) to finance needed industrial expansion and ecoic development projects. this plan is designed to preserve the positive private investment and job creation benefits of state and local idb programs. while eliminating widely perceived abuses of idbs. major elements of the legislation include: first. elimination of idb financing for certain controversial facilities. with the exception of commercial projects located in ecoically distressed areas. the legislation would prohibit the use of idbs to finance certain commercial. recreational. or entertainment facilities. specifically excluded from idb financing would be such things as golf courses. tennis clubs. racetracks. skating facilities. nightclubs. automobile dealerships. restaurants. office buildings. retail stores. and shopping centers. second. special assistance in distressed areas. commercial projects. such as restaurants. office buildings. stores. and shopping centers. would be permitted only in areas defined as ecoically distressed under the legislation. in addition. the maximum amount of idbs that could be used for a project in a distressed area would be increased from $10 million to $15 million as a means of encouraging the revitalization of ecoically distressed areas. third. umbrella financing for small business. the legislation would provide an exception to recent irs regulations to permit states to continue to issue idbs under umbrella programs. provided all projects financed by an umbrella bond issue are located within the same state. this provision will enable states to continue specially designed ide programs to help smaller firms obtain needed capital for growth and expansion. fourth. incentives for research and development. certain research and development expenditures would be excluded for purposes of calculating the capital expenditure limit under the idb program. this provision would eliminate current disincentives for research and development. and would enable growing high techogy firms to make use of idb financing. fifth. public review requirements. a "sunsbine" provision. which would require public ice of proposed idb issues and approval of such issues in an open public meeting. is included in the legislation. in addition. before an issue could be approved. the issuing authority would have to determine that the financing will result in the creation or retention of jobs. will benefit the local ecoy. and will be a significant inducement to the construction. rehabilitation. or improvement of the facility to be financed. sixth. annual reporting requirements. state authorities would be required to submit an annual report to the treasury department detailing the amount of idbs issued during the previous calendar year. by the state and its political subdivisions. the number of projects financed. the number of jobs created or retained by each project. and the names. of the firms using idb financing. . the effect of these changes will be to reduce the overall growth in the volume of taxexempt idbs. while focusing the program more directly on meeting the job creation and econr.nic development needs of the 1980s. we have two important reasons for introducing this reform legislation: first. is that the permissiveness of current law has led to emous increases in the use of private purpose idbs in recent years .nd has resulted in what most senators believe to be abuses of taxexempt financing. among the biggest users of idbs have been major national corporations which franchise fast food restaurants and own retail store chains. in many cases. taxexempt financing used to assist such commercial projects is drawing businesses to health suburban areas at the expense of our declining center cities. is this how we want to use our scarce tax dollars. to subsidize fast food restaurants. shopping centers. and office buildings. is this an intentional element of our national ecoic development strategy. i think . our reform bill. as stated earlier in my remarks. would eliminate industrial small issue idbs except in ecoically distressed areas defined as udag eligible. in these places. idb financing for office buildings. stores. and restaurants would be allowed. the second reason for our industrial development bond reform bill is that we find a compelling need to offer the senate an alternative to the administrations idb restriction proposal. the treasury has outlined a plan that would  only cripple the small issue idb program. which is used primarily to assist the expansion of smaller businesses. but it would also apply restrictions to taxexempt bonds issued for student loans. hospitals. educational facilities. nursing homes. low income multifamily housing. pollution control. and other legitimate purposes. our bill does  apply any restrictions to these uses. we propose to limit only the commercial use of small issue industrial development bonds. we feel strongly that our bill makes the kind of responsible reforms necessary to assure the idb program can continue in its traditional and important ecoic development role. this is particularly important in the context of todays high interest rates. small business. who are the beneficiaries of 93 percent of all small issue idbs. are experiencing bankruptcies at depressionera levels because of high market interest rates. the idb program is one of the only tools we have to counter the severe effects of this problem. in my state. like many others. there would have been ecoic growth in the past 2 years without industrial development bonds. i urge all our colleagues to join in supporting this bill and ask unanimous.consent that the small issue industrial development bond reform act of 1982 be printed in the record at this point.
. i am very pleased that our amendment has been included in the budget committees modified language. the committee modification deletes the $40 billion mandated social security savings yet retains the solvency provisions requiring finance and ways and means committees action by december 1 this year. the committee language completely encompasses the purposes of the amendment offered by myself and my distinguished colleagues. the committee modification is directly responsive to the expressed desire of a great many members of this body that we  mandate specific 6hanges in the social security system in order to achieve budgetary objectives. by deleting the requirement for changes in the social security system providing $40 billion of savings over 3 fiscal years. and- by removing the requirement that legislation implementing such an amount of savings be reported by the finance and ways and means committees. we make inalterably clear that any changes that may be needed to.keep the system solvent will be based on the findings of the bipartisan commission on social security reform. the modification insures that the finance and ways and means committees will report any needed changes after receiving the commissions report and after hearings and public discussion of the recommendations. it will help /assure that decisions taken by the committees will be based  on an arbitrary estimation of the needs of the system but on thorough study and analysis. i and those who cosponsored the chafeedurenberger amendment had intention of sweeping the problems of the social security system under the rug. out of sight. and thus by requiring the finance committee and ways and means committee to report by december 1 as our amendment provided. the modification ackledges that the congress may have to reconvene in december to deal with social security. i believe the committee amendment is appropriate. i am delighted it so completely embraces my objectives with regard to social security.
. i e the presence of my colleague from kansas. the chairman of the finance committee. would the senator answer a few questions about medicare and medicaid. senator dolz. it is my understanding that the present budget resolution would require savings of $4.7 billion in medicare and medicald in fiscal year 1983. $7.1 in fiscal year 1984. and $8.5 in fiscal year 1985. this is $1.2 billion less in savings in fiscal year 1983. $2 billion less in fiscal year 1984. and $3 billion less in savings in fiscal year 1985 than the original budget resolution reported by the cojnmittee would have required. r is that correct.
is the level of cuts in the present resolution acceptable to my colleague from kansas. and does he think that the level presently in the senate budget resolution will hold up after the conference with the house. if . what is an acceptable level of cuts.
. i would like to argue against the special treatment that the senior senator from wisconsin is seeking to obtain for members of congress. i think it is an outrageous provision that he has in there. i think the provision that the senators or representatives get this windfall without docum:.ntation whatsoever is something unheard of in our tax laws. the provision that is in the bill before us  provides that we must come forward with a rationalization for our deductions just like every other citizen. that is the legislation that should be before us. i find it extraordinary that he would seek a special benefit for senators. i wonder if he would be good egh to explain that to me. s 6294 co why are we entitled to this. what is he seeking. why should we get $3.000 without documenting it.
. today i am introducing legislation regarding irss proposed regulations on section 385 of the internal revenue code of 1954. if congress takes action. these regulations defining corporate debt and equity shall take effect on july 1. 1982. and. as currently drafted. will sharply curb the flow of capital to small and growing american businesses. this bill blocks the proposed regulations and directs the secretary of the treasury to take into account relevant legislative histoy if new regulations under section 385. are promulgated. to understand the rationale for such regulations. some background is help. ful. federal income tax law requires that a distinction be made between debt and equity for at least two reasons. first. interest on debt is deductible by the borrowing corporation while dividends on preferred stock are . second. the holder of a debt instrument when receiving the principal pays taxes while the owner of preferred stock who collects the original purchase price for the stock may pay taxes on this amount as ordinary dividend income. over the past 50 years. the question of deciding whether an instrument was debt or equity has fallen to the federal courts. the courts have developed .reasonable approaches to the debtequity issue. reviewing such factors as whether a corporations shareholders held the instrument in generally the same proportions as their holdings of common stock and whether the lender acted as an independent creditor. the situations in which this issue arises are disparate. and the courts have  established any rigid tests or formulas for distinguishing debt from equity. instead passing upon each concrete. factual situation. of course. this case law. which represents the courts judgments in many situations. has left gray areas in which litigation is often necessary to reach a conclusion. in 1969. responding to the conglomerate merger wave. congress enacted section 385 of the code. granting the secretary of the treasury authority to promulgate regulations which "shall set forth factors to be taken into account" in making the debtequity determination. the senate finance committee report specifically stated that the secretary of the treasury was granted the "authority to promulgate regulatory guidelines * * * [which] are to set forth factors to be taken into account" in making the debtequity determination in "a particular factual situation * * " the report used the words "guidelines" six times and the word "factors" seven times in the onepage explanation of the new section 385. because the congress. like the courts. recognized that the debtequity question arises in a myriad of contexts. a rigid set of formulas or definitive rules for making this determination were  set forth either in the law or contemplated in regulations. rather. congress intended that the regulations should codify and clarify the reasonable approach of the case law. establishing the general guidelines and specific factors relevant to making the debtequlty determination. while leaving to the courts the applica. tion of these guidelines to the concrete situations when disputes arose. in short. providing clear guidelines would establish an equitable way for determining whether a financing were debt or equity and would reduce greatly the need for litigation. nevertheless. the section 385 regulations  scheduled to take effect on july 1the revised product of rules first published in 1980go far beyond congressional intent and. indeed. constitute a needlessly complex maze of highly technical and complicated rules. there are more than 40 pages of confusing and arbitrary rules. sub. rules. definitions. exceptions. safe harbors. and rules of convenience. a businessman can read one portion of the proposed regulations without reading and analyzing dozens of other definitions. exceptions. etcetera. the comilexity of these proposed regulations will require small businesses to hire substantially more expert professional assistancemore legal and accounting feesand will entail longer delays in the making of investment derisions. while the tortuousness of these regulations is a significant indictment. especially in light of the administrations commitment to simplified government regulation of business. the real danger of the present section 385 is that they will halt much of the flow of additional capital to small business. es. a simple example can perhaps best illustrate this point. a common practice in small firms is for a major shareholder to lend to the company on a shortterm basis in an informal manner. for instance to meet payroll or expand inventory. if a loan were made and neither repaid with any interest  within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year. the regulations mandate that in most cases the irs could tax the repayment as a dividend. indeed. if this same sum were loaned for the same time over a successive number of years. each repayment could be considered a dividend and taxed at a rate of up to 50 percent. should this issue be raised on an audit. the individual could also owe interest at a 20percent annual rate on the tax deficiency. with this source of shortterm financing put off limits except at a burdensome penalty. perhaps only a bank will loan a cashstrapped business the needed money and then only at the record interest rates  prevailing. the chilling effect of these regulations as written on capital formation exists  only for established small businesses but also. and perhaps more importantly. for brand new firms with an inative product or service. a companyor individualwith an important new techogical advance is a particularly risky investment for there is  yet a market for its product. traditional financial institutions will usually  bankroll such risky businesses. and often the only source of financing for expansion is a venture capitalist. in order to risk money on such young corporations. though. a venture capital firm must share in the potentially high profits by holding traditional debt instruments which are convertible into stock or provide for an interest rate contingent on a corporations earnings or financial performance. yet. the proposed regulations allow such hybrid debt instruments to qualify as debt only if they meet a byzantine set of conditions. for example. a hybrid instrument  held proportionately will be treated as debt only if the present value of the instruments straight debt payments is more than 50 percent of its fair market value. to compute this present value. one iges any convertibility feature. assumes the smallest possible payment at the latest possible date. and discounts such payments by a rate "within the mal range of rates paid to independent creditors * * * on similar instruments by corporations of the same general size and in the same general industry. geographic location. and financial condition [as the corporation issuing the instrument]." the 50 percent present value test ingores  only the practical difficulties of determining this hypothetical interest rateit is generally impossible to determine accurately the rate at which such a corporation could make subordinated loans without any conversion or contingency featurebut also the fact that slight variations in the fair market rate are often critical to ascertaining whether the instrument is considered debt or equity. * in my opinion. impeding the flow of capital to these companies on the frontier of techogy will have important dynamic ramifications for our eomy. the american ecoy is  going through a major wave of change restructuring the face of american business. our country is moving from its predominant reliance on capitalintensive heavy industry toward kledgeintensive companies. the businesses which will be the general motors. du pont. and alcoa of the next generation are shaky young firms today or may  even exist. if the congress allows these proposed regulations to take effect. the venture capital players will stop investing their money in longshot companies. which. while admittedly the most risky. may become the foundation of our ecoy in 20 or 30 years. indeed. if congress accepts the treasurys rationale that "the advantage of objective rules in providing certainty outweigh the disadvantage of  providing the theoretically correct outcome in every case." the subsequent development of our ecoys struc.ture may result in less ination and lower productivity and growth. one other important point bears mentioning. the treasury has stated that these regulations are "revenue neutral". the federal treasury will  lose money if the proposed section 385 regulations are  in place. but allowing these rulesdrafted from the moaniacal view of setting "good tax policy"-to take effect could seriously disrupt the essential capital formation for small and growing american businesses. the bill which i introduce today la relatively simple. it recognizes that a distinction must be made between debt and equity but. unlike the proposed section 385 regulations. ackledges the relevant legislative history and the negative effect of these regulations on small independent businesses. this legislation blocks the current regulations from taking effect. directs the secretary of the treasury to take cognizance of this legislative history if he chooses to adopt new regulations under section 385. and prohibits new regulations from affecting any stock or instrument issued or obligation made until 180 days after the treasury submits then to the congress. my bill. then. will block these unduly tortuous section 385 regulations which will hinder the creation and growth of small business. perhaps more importantly. however. enacting this legislation will signal continued congressional recognition of the iportance of small. growing companies. the engines of job creation and ination. to the weal of our ecoy. over the past few years. congress has acted on several fronts to reduce the bur. dens on small business. for example. by passing the small business investment incentive act of 1980. which loosened some unnecessary strictures on the operation of business development companies and by cutting the maximum capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent as part of last years ecoic recovery tax act. permitting the treasury to put in force the proposed regulations would create a new and significant artificial burden for small business. particularly onerous and illadvised in light of the skyhigh interest rates and greatly increased small business bankruptcies of the present recession. such action would also be diametrically opposed to the policy course congress has taken in the last few years to ease the barriers preventing small business from thriving. i. therefore. urge my colleagues to join me in seeing that this modest legislation passes the senate as soon as possible.e
yet i e on page 23 of the conference report the level of outlays in function 500. that is the s t319 education. training. and social services. is cut by about $800 million from the level of the senate resolution. i would appreciate it if the chairman could explain how we can retain and even increase funding levels for these education programs. yet experience an outlay cut $800 million for the coming fiscal year.
. i want to express a concern that the new restrictions on safeharbor leasing may discourage u.s. corporations from repatriatng overseas earnings and reinvesting them in the united states. i do  believe it was the intention of the finance committee that such an effect should occur. a major employer in my state. for example. has foreign operations from which it repatriates a substantial amount of its foreign profits each yearmore than 50 percent. in fact. that revenue is then invested in rhode island to upgrade plant and equipment. to create more jobs and more competitive products. last year. 30 percent of this firms domestic capital expenditures were financed with foreign earnings. because the company is bringing home overseas profits. it is entitled to a foreign tax credit. the foreign tax credit is a longstanding principle in our tax laws. however. changes in the safeharbor leasing provisions of h.r. 4961 will require a firm to calculate its foreign tax credit based on taxable income without regard to any safeharbor lease transaction it may have entered. while the purpose of the leasing changes is to prevent abuses. this particular provision appears to restrict the ability to use foreign tax credits and. thereby. discourages the repatriation of foreign earnings to be invested in the united states. it .s my hope that this unintended problem can be resolved during conference between the senate and the house on h.r. 4691. i k the chairman of the finance committee is aware of the situation. and i would be happy to work on it with him at the appropriate time.. several senators addressed the chair.

. i support the provision in h.r. 4961 requiring an adjustment to the basis for depreciation equal to onehalf the investment tax credit. there is justifiable concern that the incentive to perform certified historic restorations rather than historic rehabilitations will be reduced when the 50 percent basis adjustment is applied. the fine tuning we made last year in the rehabilitation tax credit provisions that increased the value of the credit for historic preservation will be lost. as my colleagues will recall. the ecoic recovery tax act of 1981 provided a 25 percent investment tax credit for certified historic rehabilitation projects. we also adopted a 20 percent investment credit for rehabilitations of buildings over 40 years old. and a 15 percent credit for structures over 30 years old. for the 15percent and 20percent -categories. however. we required a full basis adjustment in order to create a wider margin between them and the 25percent category. reflecting the higher costs of doing historic rehabilitations. under h.r. 4961. a basis adjustment will also be required for property eligible for the 25percent credit. experts in historic preservation believe that this change will make it relatively more attractive to do historic restorations of valuable and irreplaceable historic properties because such restorations are less expensive. and the difference in tax benefits is  that great. while i do  propose an amendment to correct the problem at this time. i think it raises a serious egh concern to warrant thorough review by the finance and ways and means committees of the rehabilitation tax credit provisions in the tax code. it would be a tragedy to find our nations historic treasures being irreparably damaged by improper commercial reations simply because of an imbalance in tax incentives. there are a number of ways to remedy this imbalance. and i will be working with my senate colleagues and the historic preservation community to find the best solution.e
well. in answer to that question of the distinguished senator from connecticut. i would say that it is my beliefand i believe that he shares thisthat when congress wishes to do it. we can create a balanced budget. we can create a balanced budget this -aftern if we want. we do  need any special majorities. we do  need 60 votes. we can do it with 51. if there is the desire. we will do it. if there is . it will  be accomplished. so the answer to that is. yes. that clearly a balanced budget should be better derived from current processes than from a constitutional amendment.
. i oppose this resolution because i believe it is vrong to impose on the constitution a provision that is plainly unworkable. debate has shown that even senators who support the resolution have doubts about its workability. many are determined to vote for the resolution etheless. in the hope that somehow it will be made to function. they are. in my view. permitting hope to overcome the lessons of experience. the amendment just will  work. it will  work because of the emous difficulty of cutting outlays to maintain balance as a fiscal year is in progress. thus requiring us either to gut important social and defense programs. or to raise taxes. the result: taxes will be raised and those will be excise taxes. taxes on the consumer because it is only those taxes that will produce revenue swiftly. and that is what is required under this constitutional amendment. it will  work because the budget actions we would have to take to attempt to maintain budget balande could worsen recessions. generating more unemployment. it will  work because the provision for super majorities could create stalements in which a willful band of only 41 senators could by their absencethey do  even have to be presentprevent spending in times when a strong majority of 59 consider that a national ecoic or military emergency requires it. it will  work because it will be evaded by congresses determined to invent new ways to spend by using off budget agencies and ingenious new budgetary inventions. it will be avoided by congresses determined to achieve its objectives by making states and local governments. and the private sector. pay for them. proponents of the amendment see it as an important step toward ecoic stability and budget sanity. i see it as destabilizing and as the cause of even deeper public cynicism about congress. i simply am  willing to take the risk of abusing the constitution by a provision whose warts are so big and so plain. if we want to balance the budget. we have the power to do it  or whenever we decide. we do  need to use the constitution as a prop in this grand show of our dedication to fiscal responsibility. several senators addressed the chair.
. my second. third. fourth. and fifth amendments. which are at the desk. are also extremely important. as i stated earlier. the interior department. under section 341 of the omnibus budget and reconciliation act of 1981. is moving forward with prohibiting federal flood insurance in areas on its maps. s. 1018 originally contained a provision prohibiting federal fund insurance for new or substantially improved structures. but because we were able to get the federal. flood insurance cutoff provision in the omnibus budget and reconciliation act of 1981. we deleted flood insurance from the other prohibitions found in s. 1018. these amendments reinstate the flood insurance prohibition in s. 1018 and repeal the authority of the secretary of the interior to designate undeveloped coastal barriers. the amendments insure consistency and clarity by making the flood insurance prohibition and the other prohibitions of federal assistance found in s. 1018 applicable to one set of congressionally approved maps.
. recently enacted legislation. provides tax breaks for the donation of private property to the government for public purposes. and there have been indications that the secretary of the interior will recommend that the owners of land included within the coastal barrier resources system be offered certain tax concessions. could a landowner take advantage of these breaks or concessions simply by placing his property in the sytem by way of this amendment.
. that in working through this matter. we were very. very grateful and appreciative for the splendid support and understanding of the objectives of the legislation that the senior senator from south carolina demonstrated. he is a proconservationist. he was for this bill. he worked with us carefully to achieve the objectives. and i think the citizens of south carolina and. indeed. the citizens of the nation owe him a deep debt of gratitude for his very. very helpful work as we proceeded through this intricate piece of legislation. i personally am very grateful to him.
i certainly would agree with that. the senator from missouri has restricted himself to jobs that would be lost in additional highways that could be built if we did  have to pay so much for this steel. but it does far beyond that. 13 percent of the jobs in the united states of america are exportrelated. 1 out of of every 7 workers in rhode island has a job which is dependent upon exports. what the sponsors of this legislation are saying is: we do  care about you. we do  care about you. you 13 percent. in the greed to get this for this special little group of workers. they say: we are going to trample on you. on everybody else and endanger their jobs.
oh. there is question. in answer to the senator from missouri. that the amendment of the junior senator from pennsylvania is fraught with trade matters. i am sure he will admit that. that is what it is all about. at this time. i am favored by the presence of aher study on this subject. which is called. from the federal trade commission. "staff report on effects of restrictions on united states imports. five case studies in theory." by morris e. morkre and david g. tarr. from the bureau of ecoics. june 1980. i am torn between which of these important books to read first. because they are both significant and they both bear on the issue. why do i  start on the first one. so that we can k what we are dealing withit is a significant issues series of papers that are written for and published by the center for strategic and international studies at georgetown university. the views expressed in these papers are those of the authors.  necessarily those of the senator. (the significant issues series. vol. ii.  5.) before taking the substance of the book. i think perhaps it would be well to read the foreword so we can understand just what it is about. because this bears on the ecoic importance of exports to the united states. this is the foreword. which i believe my colleagues will find of interest: the united states faces a chronic crisis in its international trade accounts that adds to inflation. buffets the value of the dollar. contributes to unemployment. and heightens the increasing pressures for protectionist import policies. . we use 30.000 jobs for every $1 billion of exports. in other words. for every $1 billion that the u.s. exports 30.000 jobs are created in the united states. and i believe that is an important figure to remember. there is a lot of talk around here about jobs and protectionism and. of course. the chief sponsor of this amendment i believe would freely ackledge that it is protectionism. the ultimate in protectionism. what more protectionism can you get than buy american. wrap it up in the american flag. serve it to the american public. take care of the highest paid workers in the united states of america. do in the rest of the workers. the lower paid workers and call it good legislation. by whatever name it travels under it is protectionism and it is bad legislation. overall. nearly 1.2 million jobs in manufacturing in the united states are directly related to exports and aher 1 million jobs are involved in producing components and parts for use by plants producing for exports. a further 1.3 million employees in manufacturing industries supply materials and services to the manufacturing sector for export production. in all. nearly 3.5 million jobs are associated with exports of manufactured goods.
continuing: during this period nearly all the jobs in the boeing commercial aircraft company. the commercial jet division of the boeing corporation. were dependent on exports. as the share of exports in total production of u.s. manufactures increases. the stabilizing role of export markets could become even more important. a more detailed breakdown of these industries having the largest number of exportrelated jobs in manufacturing within each state is given in table 13. . i believe the junior senator from pennsylvania would like to explain his amendment. if he is prepared to go forward
. as we continue our deliberations on the administrations budget package. i hope more of my colleagues will join me in rejecting efforts to increase federal revenues through the imposition of a fee on domestic and imported oil.e
i certainly agree with the danger we run. i find it difficult to understand why this was brought forth. i am  questioning the motives of anybody. i k those involved feel strongly about it. but here is a jobs bill that is important across the countryit is important to michigan. to pennsylvania. to every state in the nation. we ought to get on with it. we are trying to get out of this place. we want this jobs bill to pass and pass quickly. to become effective quickly and to create jobs. and  we are risking that. how i vote today is  to be construed as my final position on withholding. as i indicated previously. i voted against it. withholding is h ing new. the democratic president. president carter. proposed withholding years ago. and we resisted that. i resisted that. but i certainly am going to resist this amendment which threatens to drag down the jobs bill with it. furthermore. i think the distinguished chairman of the finance committee has made a very valid point. we are in a recession. we are coming out of it . everything. it seems to me. hinges on this deficit. if we can bring down the deficit. which greater compliance will bring about. then the better chance of holding down the interest rates. and do  anybody think these interest rates are going to continue to go down on a slide. of course. they are . there is the threat of a curve upward. everybody says that by yesterdays paper. we are  home free. sure. the oil cartel is breaking up. opec prices seem to be coming down. all that looks favorable as far as we are concerned. but we can walk into homeplate by a long shot. the difficulty is that we need every cent we can get. we need to hold down these deficits. if the deficits stay down. then the interest rates will stay down. and that leads us to what we are most of all concerned with. reduc. ing the joblessness in the country. so i support what the chairman of the finance committee is doing this aftern. we are going to have our opportunities on other days to look at withholding. to look at it in the finance committee further. there will be other bills that it could be attached to. but this is certainly the wrong vehicle. i commend the chairman of the pinance committee in his. efforts this aftern.
. where purpose is served by retaining this tax. and industry and jobs can be helped by its elimination. there is question in my mind what we must do. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
i want to thank the distinguished senior senator from new york. who is the chief sponsor of this amendment. i should like to stress some of the points that he has made. madam president. this is a jobs bill that we are dealing with. that is why it is on the floor. this proposal is  a regional proposal. it is  going against one section of the country in favor of aher. as a matter of fact. under this proposal every single state in the nation re. ceives additional funds for their wastewater treatment facilities. what we are saying. as the senior senator from new york has just indicated. is that in the bill that has come over from the house it provides moneys that just plain can be obligated in time to create jobs. furthermore. we have taken care of the administrations proposals regarding the bureau of reclamation. as the chief sponsor of the bill just mentioned. every single cent that the administration has requested in its supplemental request dealing with the bureau of reclamation is provided for in the amendment that we are discussing this morning. hing has been taken out of the supplemental request. what we are saying is that $200 million should be taken from these funds. which are unauthorized. which can be obligated in time by the corps of engineers. and put into projects that can be obligated. that can be funded. that is the whole purpose of it. let us take a state. let us take louisiana. louisiana under this amendment receives $2.24 million for their wastewater treatment facilities. these are obligations and requirements that are backed up in louisiana. . i k that some will say that there is money already in this program that has  been obligated. the fact of the matter is that the epa in tracking this is behind. and epa. as you k. has been occupied with other things than tracking the spending and obligations of moneys under wastewater treatment. we have received word from the national league of cities. we have received word from the american metropolitan sewage agencies. which is made up of the 85 largest cities in the country. that they need these moneys. that they can use them. furthermore. madam president. i will make a statement that those in opposition to this amendment will  be able to make. that is. every cent of this money that is  obligated by the end of the fiscal year. september 30. goes back to the general treasury. . there is a claim that the supporters of the legislation as it stands on the floor can make because they k that the funds in this piece of legislation that we are considering can possibly be obligated in the required time. madam president. there came over from the house a very. very large bill dealing with water resources-$545 million. . even for those of us who are used to rather large sums. that is over a onehalf of a billion dollars. it provides $404 million for the corps of engineers. in the legislation that the senate has before it. it is $329 million. so we k there is going to be a compromise somewhat higher than the senate figure. what we are saying is that that money just can be obligated and will  end up in jobs. whereas the money we have will be obligated. we are prepared to stand behind that statement by saying that if it is  obligated by the end of this year. september 30. then it goes back into the general fund.
i just want to say briefly. . that in discussing this legislation. we can ige what the house has done. that is the point the senior senator form new york has made. inevitably. this legislation is going to go to conference. in the conference. the senate legislation is going to be increased. we k that. the house is  going to retreat completely. so what is going to happen is mammoth sums are going to end up going into the projects that the proponents of the senate bill are in favor of. they are going to get theirs. what we are saying is let us slice off a portion of this for highly needed projects that will produce jobs in every state in the nation. i thank my colleague.
 reagan has endorsed this concept and has used many of our ideas in proposing his own enterprise zone employment and development act of 1983. today i join senator bo cfwztz and a bipartisan group of 3) other senators in introducing the administrations bill. this bill is very similar to enterprise zone legislation that was favorably reported out of the senate finance committee last year. its objectives are to create jobs in targeted distressed urban and rural areas. particularly for disadvantaged workers. and to revitalize the geographic zone areas themselves. the underlying concept of this experimental program is to encourage jobcreating investment and entrepreneurial activity in the zones. this would be accomplished by providing relief from federal. state. and local taxes. and from federal. state. and local regulations. while improving some local services. the combination of all these elementsthe municipality. the state. the federal government. and the private sectorcan. we hope. create the environment necessary to revive rundown areas. because the revitalization prpgram is based on removing government burdens rather than providing government grants. it will involve federal appropriations. it will be an important complement to existing ecoic development tools. such as community development block grants. udag. job training. and antirecessionary jobs programs. eligibility of an area for enterprise zone designation will be based on criteria of poverty. unemployment. and ecoic distress. however. this will  be an automatic entitlement. rather. an eligible area will have to be inated by the city and state government. and then officially designated by hud. the federal designation process will be competitive. with 75 zones selected over 3 years. the purpose of this is to move ahead slowly. to get some experience. to see whether we are embarking down the right road before we start on a fullblown program with zones all across the nation. fourteen states have already enacted enterprise zone legislation and some have even started designating areas eligible for state and local government incentives. it is my hope that we can enact this federal legislation quickly and implement this program as soon as possible. with the active support of the administration and the 32 senate cosponsors already on board. i am confident this goal can be met. my finance subcommittee on savings. pensions. and investment policy will conduct hearings on this bill on april 22.
i do  understand the reason that the proponents have brought this legislation up . we thrashed around. lost a whole week last week. and finally got it set aside while we went to the jobs bill. and  we are on one of the most important pieces of legislation we will consider in this congress. namely saving of the social security trust fund. i personally believe we have to get on with this. we are running up against deadlines.  only are we running up against deadlines. but we have a series of other serious amendments that are going to come up. am i correct in asking the senator from kanssthere are some major amendments that are going to be proposed on the floor dealing with social security. is that  correct.
i think my real question to the senator from kansas is. as i see it: there is a sense of urgency about this matter because we have got to pass it. the conference has to pass it. we have a conference on the jobs bill to wrestle with. and we have a goodsized menu before we get out of here for the easter recess. if we do get out. and i would presumewell. i think the house is going to go anywayso the longer we take here the greater it seems to me we endanger the prospects of these two very important bills. would the senator agree with me on that.
that is the theory of it. that is the theory. that one shifts into tax exempts and his income is reduced. it is  always so. i have here a clipping from the washington post of last friday: try new investment formula. 10.13 percent. taxexempt money market and municipal bond fund. just $2.000 to open an account. total liquidityin other words. short term. unlimited checking. these are tax exempts. it says if you are in the 50percent bracket even in the 24percent bracket. 1033 it does  always work out that way.
. on april 8. 1983. four of my republican colleagues and i unveiled an alternative federal budget proposal. we believe that this spending plan. which increases revenues. lowers the rate of defense spending and restores money for many necessary social programs. will protect the ecoic recovery and provide new jobs. i ask that the summary of this budget proposal be entered into the record.
s purpose: ecoic recovery. ours is a prudent. sensible. fair and responsible budget proposal that i hope will provide the basis for a bipartisan consensus as the senate begins its debate on the 1984 budget.
. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the supplemental retirement benflit act of 1983 be printed in the kecorn at this point. there b.tti objcttion. the bill was orlermi to be printed in the recora. &r fol.ows: s. l0006 be it enuateud by the senate and house of reptesentatiue of he united states of america in congress assembled. that section 1. short title.-this act may be cited as the "supplemental retirement benefit act of 1983". sec. 2. (a) section 401 of the internal revenue code of 1954 (relating to qualified pension. profitsharing. stock bonus plans. etc.) is amended by inserting after subsection (1) the following new subsection:
. these distinguished individals call our attention again to the need to reduce deficits. i and four other republican senators. have presented an alternative budget that would accomplish this objective by reducing thb deficit to $102 billion by 1988. the budget committees resolution would reduce it to $123 billion in the same year. other senators have proposed plans. the important thing is  to get on with the work by beginning consideration of 4he budget resolution and resolving the issues of deficits. spending. and revenues that such consideration entails. i ask unanimous consent that the report referred to be included in the record.
 has an important stake in strengthening the congressional budget process. his own program of spending cuts and tax cuts could  have been enacted in 1981 without the recontiliation procedures provided by the budget process.
. today senator bentsen and i are introducing legislation amending the internal revenue code of 1954 to repeal the 30percent tax on certain interest payments received by foreigners. this bill exempts foreign persons and corporations from u.s. income and withholding taxes on interest income from debt obligations guaranteed by domestic corporations. current law levies and withholds a 30percent income tax on resident aliens and foreign corporations receiving interest payments from u.s. corporations. this 30percent tax effectively operates as a tariff. preventing the influx of foreign capital to help finance american business. one result of the current law is that in order to sell bonds and other obligations abroad. u.s. corporations must assume the cost of the withholding tax by increasing the rate of interest. accordingly. to blunt the effect of the withholding rule. u.s. corporations have established offshore finance subsidiaries that take advantage of favorable tax treaties. the most prominent of the tax havens is the netherland antilles. these financing subsidiaries erode confidence in the integrity of the u.s. tax system. promote treaty shopping. and may interfere with treaty negotiations. foreign investments provide needed capital for our own domestic business expansion and for the creation of new jobs. it is important to have access to this source of capital. repeal of the withholding requirements would benefit the u.s. ecoy in the following ways: first. more capital at lower longterm rates. increasing investment. r&d. jobs. and lowering treasury bor. rowing costs: second. reassertion of u.s. control of a large part of the offshore dollar bond market: third. allow all u.s. companies and treasury access to the worldwide dollar bond market. thus effectively ending the use of tax havens for tax avoidance. and fourth. revenue increase to treasury. estimated to be as much as $50 million. the bill applies to the following three categories of u.s. issuers: first. interest paid on obligations sold to foreign persons by finance subsidiaries prior to the enactment of this bill and later assumed by a domestic corporation. second. interest paid on new obligations sold directly or through underwriters under arrangements designed to insure their initial sale only to foreign persons. third. interest paid on obligations  in bearer form where the withholding agent has received a statement to the effect that the beneficial owner of the obligation is a foreign person. exempted from the bill is interest on commercial bank loans with foreigners. this bill has had bipartisan support in the house and senate: congressmen gns and conable have introduced a similar bill this year. the treasury departments support is demonstrated by its letter to congressman gibbons. which i ask be printed in the record following my remarks. moreover. the finance committee unanimously reported this measure in i request unanimous consent that the bill appear in the record following my remarks.
. on june 27 senator symms and i introduced a bill that would amend the internal revenue code of currently. a number of foreign countries tax income from technical services performed in the united states that relate to construction projects in that country. at that same time. income from such services is frequently taxed by our government. which results in double taxation. the added cost puts american firms at a significant disadvantage when competing for foreign projects. this .s an inequitable and unintended result of current tax laws. accordingly. our bill. s. 1550 would remove this unfair penalty by permitting u.s. firms to deduct the foreign tax on u.s. construction services. thus. we would avoid double taxation as do countries which have tax structures similar to ours (for example. canada. united kingdom. the netherlands). s. 1550 will be in the best interests of the united states. american construction firms will be on a competitive par with u.s. firms competing internationally. this means more u.s. jobs and an improved balance of trade. in addition. the ecoic stimulus of eliminating double taxation will result in an estimated increase of $100 million in annual tax revenues for the u.s. treasury. according to a study by the national constructors association. i request unanimous consent that the following two reports be printed in full in the record. the first is a study completed by arthur young and co.. while the second is an analysis undertaken by the national constructors association. both conclude that s. 1550 is a necessary reform of current tax laws.
. on june 28. senator bentsen and i introduced a bill (s. -1557) that would amend the internal revenue code of 1954 by repealing the 30percent tax on certain interest payments by u.s. corporations to foreigners. the bill has had bipartisan support in the house and senate. in addition. the treasury department supports the repeal of the withholding tax. i request unanimous consent that a report by the section of taxation of the american bar association be printed in full in the record. it highlights the need for the repeal of the 30percent tax because of the increasing abuse of international financial subsidiaries for the purpose of avoiding u.s. withholding taxes. the report also points out difficulties that the united states encounters when trying to renegotiate tax treaties with other countries because of the current 30percent tax.

. i would also like to mention that section 8 of s. 1887 increases the fiscal year 1984 authorization for title xx. the social services bloc grant. from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. the first concurrent budget resolution allowed for a $300 million increase in the program. senator bradley and i offered this amendment during the finance coinmittees consideration of the unemployment compensation extension. senators durenberger. hieinz. matsunaga. and moynntan cosponsored thle $200 million increase. this measure would provide additionalauthorization for those who are concerned with the social services block grant. namely children. providing day care centers for those who are lowincome working families and to women with work or training programs. the 1981 budget cut in title xx decreased its funding by 21 percent. one result of the cut has been welldocumented by the childrens defense fund. according to cdp. fewer children are receiving title xx child care. those hurt most by these cuts have been those lowincome working families and women in work or training programs. states have made. through necessity. the difficult choice between providing title xx assistance either to children from severly troubled families. or to children from lowincome working families. unemployment and budget cuts have added to the pressures already felt by lowincome families. the result has been an increase in reported child abuse. neglect. and requests for foster care placements. the importance of title xx can be overstated. title xx provides vital funds for a range of services for children and their families. disabled persons. and the elderly. the committee amendment will certainly help to meet the original goals of the programnhelping people attain or maintain ecoic selfsufficiency.
. i am pleased to join senator bentsen in intraducing thle life insurance tax act of 1983. this bill is identical to thle proposal which was recently considiered and approved by thle house committee on ways and means. i am introducing this measure today to bring this important piece of legislation to thle attention of my colleagues. so that a hearing can be held and the taxation of the life insurance decided by the end of this year. the ilfe insurance industry has been operating under a socalled stop gap system of taxation during this past year while a suibstantial revision of the taxation of the industry was being considered and debated. this stopgap measure expires on december 31. 1983. and thus action on the proposed revisions is necessary to prevent the disruption that further uncertainty as to the taxation of the industry could cause. thle bill contains a complete revision of the very complex laws governing the taxation of life insurance companies and represents the first such substantial revision since 1959. the main goals of this proposal are: first. to provide for a more accurate. and hopefully less complex. measure of the true ecoic income of a life insurance company. second. to strike a proper balance between the tax burdens on the two major segments of the industry and assure an appropriate level of taxation for the industry as a whole. third. to establish appropriate tax treatment for some of the new consumeroriented products being offered by insurance companies. in introducing this legislation today i want to make it clear that i am  endorsing every single provision in this very complicated proposal. rather. i am giving my support to the basic system of taxation established by the legislation and the major principles that are at the heart of this compromise proposal. i expect that this bill will be subject to careful examination during the hearing process. and it may be that changes are necessary to accomplish the goals i have outlined above. especially with regard to the appropriate level of tax that should be paid by the life insurance industry as a wvhole. i urge my colleagues to consider this matter seriously before the close of the year.*
. i send to the desk an amendment to s. 1283. a bill to amend the solid waste disposal act to authorize funds for fiscal year 1984. ca]lndar  144. and ask unanimous consent that it be printed. on may 16. 1983. the committee on environment and public works reported s. 1283 to the senate. rhat bill contained a simple 1year reauthorization of the solid waste disposal act and was reported by the committee to comply with the requirements of thle congressional budget act. a more extensive bill was developed and. on october 28. 1983. the committee reported s. 757 to the senate. calendar  500. as stated on page 1 of the report accompanying s. 757. senate report  98284. it is the intention of the committee of offer the text of s. 757 as a committeesponsored amendment to s. 1283. when the senate adopts the committeesponsored amendmnent to s. 1283. the legislative history of s. 1283 shall then include report  98284 and s. 1283. as amended. will be kn as the solid waste disposal act amendments of 1983.0
yes. . i support the work of the finance committee. it makes an important contribution to deficit reduction. and it makes necessary revisions in current law. although i. and several colleagues. will introduce shortly a comprehensive budget plan that will achieve much more substantial budget deficit reductions. i. etheless. strongly support the finance committee package.
the senator is correct. . some say we should have this. maybe we should. it is a lovely piece of candy. and i am  going to take it away from anyone. all i am saying is let us postpone it for 3 years and then we will have a chance to look at it. maybe we will be a great big wealthy country with that balanced budget we have all been seeking and. wonderful. we will take it. but how in the name of any sense of fiscal responsibility can we do it .
let me say this to the senator from arkansas: the point he makes is a valid one. but i do  have the language to do that right . here we are with a head of steam up. and i would hate to get diverted at this particular point. could i say this to the senator from arkansas: would he and his allies. those who believe as he does. pitch in and help with my amendment. then tomorrow if this passes. we would be glad to have a further amendment to the tax bill to accomplish what the senator from arkansas proposes. and i would support it. it makes sense. and i an  out to hurt anybody who mally would  be in the tax brackets if the inflation situation should continue to such an extent.
i appreciate that. let me say one other thing to everybody gathered here tonight. there are those who say. "oh. this is part of the presidents program." . that is  so. the president did  have this in his program.  when he campaigned in 1980  when he sent his proposals up to the congress in 1981. indexing was never part of it. indexing crept in. as a matter of factand the chairman of the finance committee can correct me on thisit is my memory s 4224 co that when we brought that tax bill to the floor it did  include indexing. would the senator from kansas correct me. am i right in that.
let me finish. in answer to the senators question. the answer is  if you want to pr sent something tomorrow or whatever you want to do. that is the senators business. the amendment that i have before the senate tonight only deals with the indexing of the tax code. which was an afterthought in the 1981 tax package.
i can tell the senator from idaho this: if he thinks my amendment has got tough sledding. if he added in all the provisions he has. that amendment would  even start sledding. it would be stuck before it could go anywhere. so i say let us do what we can right . if the senator wants to come forward with aher proposal. there is plenty of room. we are  going to finish tonight. as a matter of fact. i think we will probably be on this bill a good portion of tomorrow. so come forward with your measure then. but. in the meantime. strike a blow for freedom. strike a blow for fiscal responsibility. i have room for one more cosponsor. and i would be glad to have the senators name on it.
are they going to show us that the lower the taxes we pay the better off the country is. i suppose if you follow that argument to its logical conclusion. we would  pay any taxes and things would be great. we would just borrow the balance from somebody. but the truth of the matter is. ladies and gentleman. it does  take any genius to figure out that when you do  have any money. you should  embark on a $51 billion expenditure program. that is what we are doing starting in 1985. here is a chance to end that before it even starts. the people will  object one bit. i wonder how many senators have had people come up to them on the streets and say. "isnt it marvelous. in 1985 you are going to start indexing my taxes." one has said that to us. what people are interested in is how much it costs to finance their automobile and how much it costs for their children to buy a house. "when are you going to. get these interest rates under control." "when those are the questions people ask us. and are you going to do something about the federal deficit." here is a major effort to do something about it. in one single vote we will accomplish more than all that has been accomplished in about a monthandahalf in the finance committee when we struggled. huffed and puffed and finally. with herculean effort. come up with $48 billion.
. while i support the effort to obtain a deficit reduction of $100 billion as entailed in the socalled leadership plan or downpayment. i think we can do much more. and i think that the country would welcome it. the plan we offer today cuts spending by a total of $89 billion. including $24 billion of interest savings. it raises revenues by $117 billion through fiscal year 1987. the result is to reduce deficits to $164 billion in fiscal year 1985. $150 billion in fiscal year 1986. and $139 billion in fiscal year 1987. the deficit reductions thus accomplished are larger than those proposed in the socalled democratic caucus plan. or in the republican leadership plan. with regard to revenues. the plan presumes adoption of the finance committee amendment and the tax increases it entails. totaling about $48 billion. it also presumes adoption of substantial additional revenues which could be obtained in a number of ways. one of the obvious ways of raising substantial revenues is by postponing tax bracket indexing to calendar year 1988. we simply do  believe that we can afford what is effectively a tax cut of $51 billion at a moment of absolute crisis in budget policy. this is one means of raising additional revenues which seems especially appropriate. there are many others. with regard to spending. the plan projects spending cuts through fiscal year 1987 of $65 billion. of which $24 is reduced defense spending and $41 is reduced entitlement spending. the plan does  contemplate cuts in overall defense appropriations. with regard to defense spending. the plan provides a real growth rate of 3 percent. much confusion seems to surround discussions of defense spending. one major reason is that different people choose different baselines against which to apply cuts. the baseline that our plan adopts is the cbo baseline of 5 percent real growth. we use the cbos baselines for all the other accounts in the budget.  to do so for defense would be questionable. our plan cuts $24 billion in fiscal year 198587 from baseline defense spending by lowering real growth to 3 percent. for fiscal year 1985. this reduces outlays by only $3 billion. one can convince me that this is an insupportable. draconian amount. it permits total defense spending for fiscal year 1985 to be $260 billion. an increase of fully $25 billion from fiscal year 1984. with regard to entitlements. the largest single element of the budget. the plan provides a 3year reduction of $41 billion. this could result from reforms in revenue sharing. unemployment compensation. farm programs and medicare and medicaid. for example. the cbos recommendation that general revenue sharing be limited only to thowe jurisdictions experiencing fiscal distress would save $4 billion over 3 years. reforms in unemployment compensation could result. in savings of nearly $3 billion. changes in the medicare and medicald programs could include those programs already reported by the finance committee as part of the tax package. i believe there is a very substantial opportunity for savings in farm programs. saving $41 billion in entitlement spending etheless permits total entitlement spending for fiscal year 1987 to rise to $470 billion. compared to the $400 billion spend in fiscal year 1984. with regard to defen.e appropriations. the plan accepts the cbo baseline. providing therefore cuts or increases in total projected spending for these programs. relative to defense and to entitlement spending. the appropriated defense programs are a small share of the budget. particularly considering their scope. they encompass every area of domestic spending from the national parks to housing. education. and health research. yet these accounts have borne the main burden of the effort since 1981 to reduce the growth rate of government spending. and. in fact. the share of total spending taken by these programs has fallen from 24 percent in fiscal year 1980 to 17 percent in fiscal year 1984. our plan therefore provides for baseline funding. but it would also permit increases in certain high priority programs. to be offset by compensating cuts in other. lower priority programs. the result of this plan would be a substantial threeyear reduction of the deficit by $206 billion. double the reduction of the leadership plan as estimated by the cbo. on the democratic caucus plan. we believe this to be a responsible program which is needed to achieve the deficit reductions that are necessary to insure ecoic prosperity. i ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of remarks by my colleagues senators mathias. stafford. and weicker. a summary of our budget plan and an explanation be included in the record.
the senator is correct in the latter part of his statement. this was a component part of a very difficult measure. to assemble the social security compromise. there was give and take. there was a very substantial tax increase on the workers. there was a postponement of benefits for the recipients. in that there was a delay of a year in their costofliving adjustment. for those who were future retirees. as the senator remembers. everybody swallowed hard. but voted for it. there was an increase in the retirement age. starting in the year 2020. up to 66. and then to 67. taxation of benefits was also one of the integral parts.
i was listening to the debate. the question was about the effect of the tax on american wines. american wines have been suffering in competition with the imported wines but. clearly. any federal tax increase placed on american wines obviously applies to imported wines as well.
. let me say aher thing. in backing up what the senator from louisiana said. the way this thing is being paid for is through depriving the inner cities of the tax credits that have been used for the rehabilitation of older buildings. that tax credit has been one of the great incentives for the rehabilitation of the older buildings in the core cities all over the country. that is being reduced. as the senator said. we were  getting anywhere with trying to preserve those buildings and have them adopt a new life through hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in them before we went to these tax credits. but that is being whittled away under the proposal here tonight. so i join the senator from louisiana. and i hope we can prevail in this vote.
with regard to the comments of the distinguished senator from new mexico. i would comment that we can discuss this in many ways but to suddenly accuse our plan of lacking fiscal responsibility is an unusual charge because our plan costs $17 billion less than the leadership plan. if ours is fiscally irresponsible. that leaves the leadership plan fiscally irresponsible plus $17 billion. many charges can be made against our plan. we are open to those charges. and expect to be beaten over the shoulders with all sorts of accusations. but let us  use the one of fiscal irresponsibility. when we are running $200 billion deficits-$200 billion deficits for each of 3 years. which is 3 times 2 and makes it $600 billionand we come in with a downpayment package that of only $100 billion. if we can add $17 additional to that and reduce the deficit. there ought to be three cheers. if we want to argue that there is  egh for defense. or that there should be more for defense. or that we are spending too much on defenze discretionaries. ok. let us hear it. but any attack along the lines of fiscal irresponsibility i do  think holds water.
 should avoid imposing a remedy which will result in retaliation by our trading partners or make the debt situation in developing countries even worse. i ask that these editorials be printed in the record. the editorials follow: (from the washington post. june 13. 19841
. where purpose is served by retaining this tax. and industry and jobs can be helped by its elimination. there is question in my mind what we must do. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
ial or congressional appointees. it is a private groupwas set up. as i understand it. to draw building codes for the country. this was back in 1974. it was further my understanding that this group was to become selfsupporting after a certain period. instead. this budget provides a supplemental appropriation for the remainder of this fiscal year of a quarter of a million dollars. that is all right. i am  going to argue about that. whatever it is for. but thereafter it follows that there is an entitlement program set up for this group whereby it will receive up to $500.000 a year. that is half a mil. lion dollars a year in perpetuity. they autgust 8. 1984 are  supervised by anybody. i k that the appropriations committee will take a look at them  and then. but i think this is bad business. i would like an explanation by someone as to what this group does. if it is a legitimate organization then let us make an annual appropriation for them. if it is . then let them go on their way and support themselves.* sowhoever is cognizant of what this group does. i would appreciate hearing more about it.
 reagans enterprise zone initiative. the bill introduced is similar to my original proposal. first introduced in the 97th congress as s. 2298. the enterprise zone tax act of 1982. however. the bill introduced yesterday has been modified and it is identical to the provisions the senate passed this spring as part of the deficit reduction act of 1984. the senate has passed enterprise zone legislation twice since 1983. but the house has refused to consider the bill. during the recent conference on the deficit reduction act of 1984. the house conferees refused to aicept our enterprise zone provisions. even though the enterprise zone bill in the house had 257 cosponsors. yesterdays proposal is a modest experiment which may prove to be of tremendous ecoic importance to the most financially distressed areas of our country. the proposal authorizes the secretary of the department of housing and urban development to designate up to 25 areas per year. for a period of 3 years. as enterprise zones. these zones would then qualify for certain special federal tax treatment. areas would be inated by state and local governments and would have to meet certain criteria of ecoic distress and population. have a continuous boundary. and receive a commitment from the sthte and locality to take a course of action designed to remove impediments to ecoic development in the area. enterprise zones would be designated before january 1. 1985. once designated. enterprise zones would receive the following federal tax relief: an additional investment tax credit of 3 or 5 percent for personal property and 10 percent for real property for capital investment in the zone. a 10percent tax credit to employers for increases paid to zone employees over the previous year. at a maximum of 2v/ times the employers futa wage base. a tax credit for employers for wages paid to disadvantaged zone employees. equal to 50 percent of wages paid to such employees counting federal subsidies for job training. this credit would be available for 7 years and drop 10 percent per year beginning in the fourth year. a 5percent tax credit to employees in the zone for income earned in zone employment. maximum $450 per employee. capital gains tax would  be imposed on the gain from the sale of any interest in a zone business or any property used in the conduct of a zone business. the restrictions on the use of acrs for idbfinanced property. and the sunset of the small issue exemption. would  apply to idbs used to flnance zone small busness. in addition. enterprise zones would be given preference in establishing foreign trade zones. and they could qualify for limited federal regulatory relief. federal contributions would last 20 years with a 4year phaseout. the sabre foundation has conduct. ed a study of statedesignated enterprise zones. twentyone states have enacted similar enterprise zone prograins. and enterprise zones are  operational in nine states. the sabre foundation conducted interviews with and mailed questionnaires to state and local officials to assess the record of active enterprise zones in 182 communities. i am requesting that a summary of the findings of the sabre foundation study be included in the record immediately following my remarks. the study revealed that at. a state level. the enterprise zones are working to create new jobs. especially for the previously unemployed and disadvantaged. the survey also seems to indicate that the principal gains in employment are coming.  from the relocation of companies to the zones. but from the expansion of established firms and startups of small businesses. the zones also seem to have a disproportionately beneficial effect on manufacturing as a sector. the sabre foundation study is certainly  conclusive. but it does give us reason to continue to pursue this proposal on a federal level. it just may work. and i urge my other colleagues to join with us today in this experiment to revitalize and create jobs in some of the most ecoically distressed areas of our country.
i thank both senators. i say to the chairman and the ranking miity member that i was pleased that in the legislation before the senate they already have provisions dealing with "green mail"-that is. management protecting themselves by buying off threatening stockholders. furthermore. the committee has provisions in the bill dealing with the "golden parachute." which of course is outrageousand which we dealt with in the tax bill. so we are taking steps toward making management more responsible and for making the directors realize that they have duties. they are  just there as tools of management. to sit at the board meetings and sweep up  only the hoaria they mally receive but also their fees as directors for attending the meetings. it is my hope that directors in the united states will become more responsible. and certainly that is what we are striving for. . i have hing further to say on this matter. and i suggest the absence of a quorum.
madam president. today we are adopting the conference report on the defense authorization bill. this report. which represents the product of many hours of dedicated effort by the committee conferees. the senate and house leadership. and the administration. contains a number of important provisions in addition to the overall defense spending figures. several features of this bill are especially eworthy. first. the total amount of spending authorized. $297 billion. is considerably below the initial amount requested by the administration. as part of our related actions on the budget resolution and in the appropriations process. the congress will agree to an actual defense spending figure of $293 billion. compared to the administrations original request of $313 billion. our action represents a substantial reduction in defense spending. while i do  wish to detract from the fine efforts of the leadership and other senators in reaching this agreement. i do want to point out that 5 months ago this option was available to us. and had we acted upon it at that time we could have been spared much of the intervening effort and concluded our business in a much more orderly fashion. in may of this year. i and five of my colleagues introduced an amendment to the budget resolution then under consideration which would have pegged the defense appropriation at $291 billion. our proposal was narrowly rejected at that time. but it had great meritindeed. it has been adopted for all practical purposes by the congress. i applaud this action. it represents a more reasonable balance of fiscal and defense priorities. providing for roughly 5 percent real growth in defense spending while. at the same time. reducing the deficit over the next 3 years by $27.3 billion compared to the senatepassed version of the budget resolution. i believe this action affirms the merit contained in the budget amendment i offered last spring. and i congratulate the conferees on this action. the conference report also contains the substance of the amendment i cosponsored with senator bumpers and others calling for continued adherence to the policy of abiding by the unratifled salt ii treaty. the two reports which are required by this amendment in 1985 should serve as important elements in the critical discussions on arms control policy which will be held next year. both in this body and in the country at large. i am pleased that the conference had the good judgment to retain this amendment. and i congratulate the conferees. aher part of the conference agreement concerns the mx missile. as is well kn by . we will have two more opportunities next spring to examine the missile and its basing mode in the light of progress in arms control and other developments concerning the basing mode. this method of proceeding represents a responsible and prudent course. enabling us to examine carefully the issues surrounding the mx before proceeding further with deployment of the missile. i also want to mention that the conference report contains limitations on antisatellite testing. and it retains the senate amendment concerning ratification of the threshold test ban treaty. the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty. and efforts to negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty. these are important measures. and i am pleased to support them as part of the overall defense authorization.
. i am today introducing legislation that will be an alternative to the surtax that has been proposed by some as a means for raising revenue next year. i think that it is secret that the next congress is going to be faced with some very difficult choices as it attempts to reduce the growing federal deficit. spending cuts alone will  suffice. and revenue increases will in all likelihood be necessary. it is my hope that any revenue raising next year would be done in the context of tax reform. by "tax reform" i mean revising the current tax code to disperse more equitably the burden of taxation. we are all awaiting the recommendations of the treasury department study of alternative systems of taxation which is due in december. there have already been a number of major tax reform measures introduced. such as the bradleygephardt and kempkasten proposal. which i hope the congress will continue to debate and consider seriously next year. all these proposals should be examined carefully. unfortunately. i fear that the debate on tax reform may take quite a while and the pressilre to raise revenue may push the congress into considering a surtax as an immediate solution to the problem. the proposal i am introducing today is an alternative to that sort of quick fix. it is what some have called a reverse surtax. a surtax would increase the taxes of those who are already paying taxes. a surtax simply exacerbates the inequities and disparities in the levels of taxation in the current system. those who are taking advantage of the many deductions. credits. and exemptions in the tax code to reduce their taxes will continue to enjoy lower taxes. those who are paying the maximum will pay even more. before we raise the rates again to over 50 percent of any taxpayers income. i think we should call upon those who are paying less tax. as a result of all those deductions. credits. and exemptions. to make a contribution. the bill i am introducing today will take a little10 percentoff of all the socalled tax preferences. it is a "haircut." it is  designed to scalp anyone. i just want to shave a little off of all these breaks.  gouge any one industry. it will be an acrosstheboard cutback of 10 percent on most tax expenditures. this proposal should  be confused with tax reform. i have  evaluated each and every one of these deductions. credits. and exemptions and attempted to decide on the merits which should stay. which should go. and which should be modified. that would be tax reform. this legislation is aher method for a tax increase. it raises the taxes of those who are taking the most advantage of all the special tax breaks which we have put in the code. it raises the taxes of the 40 percent of all taxpayers who itemize. but it does  affect the 60 percent who file the socalled short form. many of the tax preferences. or tax expenditures in the code are working very well. for example. the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions have succeeded in encouraging home ownership and charitable giving much more efficiently and less intrusively than any federal direct spending program could ever have done. however. there are undoubtedly some of these tax breaks which may need to be revisited and examined to see whether they are working as originally intended. that process of examination will be the tax reform we will undertake next year. in the meantime. this legislation simply proposes a 10percent cutback on all of them. for example. an individual filling out his or her income tax returns will calculate all the deductions on schedules a and b as usual. but instead of deducting 100 percent of all those items. the individual will simply deduct 90 percent of the total. everyone should still have 90 percent of the tax breaks he or she had before. this sort of belttightening may pinch our personal or business budgets but it shouldnt kill anyone. this bill is very similar to a bill introduced in the house by congressman stark. h.r. 6308. and like mr. stark. i am introducing it as a discussion draft. i we).iome the comments and suggestions of my colleagues and of the public. ]."or example. i think there is still a question as to whether the cutback on credits and deductions should be the same. perhaps the cutback on tax credits should be less in order to have the same ecoic effect. in addition. this legislation has  proposed cutbacks in some business deductions. such as the deduction for salaries paid employees or the cost of goods sold. on the basis that these deductions are  tax incentives or preferences. but rather are the basic deductions necessary for calculating the actual profit of the business. this legislation is  an alternative to tax reform. it is simply a more eqilitable measure for raising revenue temporari .y if we need to while we are debdting thoroughgoing reform. i intend to work separately on tax reform measures. but in the meantime i will continue to refine this legislation. so that it can be used as an alternative to any surtax proposals.9 by mr. deconcini:
. during this congress. i have tried at various points to pass a bill which i introduced. s. 1550. to deal with the problem of the double taxation of services performed here in the united states by both the united states and foreign countries. we held hearings on this bill in the finance committee and i considered adding this measure to the deficit reduction act of 1984. however. the treasury department. while recognizing the problem. has consistently opposed the solution proposed in s. 1550. as a result. i requested that the treasury department do a study and report on the foreign taxation of fees paid to domestic companies for services performed here in the united states. the treasury department has finished this study and report which i would like to submit for the record today immediately following my remarks.
. i also do hope that we can revisit this next year. obviously. there are several parts of this bill that are deeply troubling to many of us here this evening. it seems to me some of the problems are such as the difference in the interest rate that the government borrows at and that the government loans at through the rea. i hope these matters could be addressed. and the criticisms of the congressional budget office. the administration. and some of the members of the council of ecoic advisers. there is a whole series of people who have given this very thoughtful attention. during the forthcoming year i hope these matters can be addressed. those of us who are opposed to this particular bill are  opposed to rea. we recognize the tremendous contributions it has made to the nation. we recognize the differences that come with trying to string a line out to farms that are 2. 3. and sometimes 8. 10 miles apart compared to the cost to string a line in a city where there are so many drops to houses close by. but it seems to me approaching it this way is  the best approach. so therefore. . i commend those who.have suggested we give it some careful consideration next year.
. i think we would all do well to reflect on this aspect of the intelligence profession whenever we debate or consider a matter of controversy in u.s. intelligence. we as a nation owe a debt of gratitude to people in the intelligence community that we can name. for accomplishments that can be trumpeted. i salute the men and women of our intelligence communitythose who have served. those who are presently serving. and those yet to comeand thank them for their unique sacrifice.
madam president. i would have liked to have been able to offer for consideration today a bill which i previously introduced as s. 1380. however. in view of the lateness of the hour. i have decided  to do so. this bill was passed by the senate in 1982 as part of h.r. 4717. however it was dropped in conference on the bill because the house had  held hearings on the corresponding house bill. the house committee on ways and means has  held hearings on the bill. and i think there is an excellent chance for passage in the next congress. the hearings in ways and means were held on october 3. 1984. and the treasury department testified in support of the identical house bill. h.r. 2686. in substance. my bill is designed to fully implement a piece of legislation which the congress passed in 1980the small business investment incentive act of 1980 (pl. 96477). this legislation allows certain venture capital companies. which had previously been required to register under the investment company act of 1940. to register instead as a business development company ebdc]. registration as a business development company imposes less burdensome regulatory requirements that the registration under the 1940 act. unfortunately. some companies are  taking advantage of the new registration as a bdc because if they do they will lose the beneficial tax treatment they have as a registered investment company [ric]. rics enjoy conduit tax treatment under section 851 of the internal revenue code. and thus avoid the double taxation of their earnings. this bill would allow business development companies [bdcs). which would otherwise qualify as registered investment companies. to retain their beneficial tax treatment. the treasury department supports this legislation. and the senate previously passed the legislation in 1982. it would entail a revenue loss of less than $50 million a year. the treasury department in its testimony before the house committee on ways and means on october 3. 1984. suggested three changes in the original bill which i agree should be made. and i intend to make these changes before introducing the bill again in the next congress. october ii. 1984
. i ask consent to insert text of my letter to secretary baker. urging the administration to drop the proposal limiting the tax deductibility of charitable contributions. the letter follows: hon. james a. baker. secretary of treasury. washington. dc. dear jim: my purpose in writing today is to express my very deep concern about one element of the treasury departments tax simplification proposal. namely the effect it would have upon charitable contributions. i fear that if this proposal is adopted. it will have severe repercussions upon a host of organizations in the united stateschurches. schools and universities. museums and other charitable entitieswhich rely either in whole or in part upon the generosity of taspaying americans. while limiting the deductibility of charitable contributions would  bring an end to philanthropy. such limits could very well jeopardize the programs of many private organizations and. in the case of some. put them out of business. if this were to happen. the irony would be that congress could well be deluged with new calls for increased government aid and support. thus defeating the goal of this administration to cut spending. a few figures about charitable contributions have begun to emerge since the treasury proposal was unveiled. private colleges and universities. for example. receive. on average. 11 percent of their operating funds from gifts. and the fear is growing that this percentage would fall if the deductions that could be claimed for such contributions were limited. given the administrations call for futher cutbacks in student aid. such fears are legitimate. other organizations rely far more heavily upon private gifts. ably churches and such community charities as the united way. which estimates the donations it receives could fall as much as 20 percent if the treasury proposed is adopted. i realize that a debate is  going on within the administration over the final scope of the tax simplification plan to be submitted to congress later this year. i would urge you to use your influence to drop the provisions relating to charitable deductions. i believe such provisions will  find favor with congress and will merely divert attention from the larger issue of tax reform. if. by chance. such provisions were to be adopted. they would  only cause a great deal of harm to countless private organizations which rely upon charity. but would also be counterproductive. setting off new demands for increased federal government aid which we can afford. i look forward to hearing from you on this matter. sincerely.
 would be required to submit a report to congress within 1 year of enactment of this legislation explaining steps that the united states could take to promote cooperation by other countries to prevent bribery. let us  waste aher congress. aher year. or aher month. we are losing overseas business and jobs each day we delay. u.s. trade representative brock has testified before the senate that this law alone has cost u.s. industry billions of dollars in sales and thousands of jobs. our mounting trade deficit makes further delay unjustifiable. in countries such as indonesia. and the philippines. u.s. companies are hamstrung by the fact that japanese and south korean firms frequently make large payments or provide special deals to local officials or businessmen in return for import licenses or approval of investments. such payments are subject to stiff penalties under the u.s. law. i am certainly  advocating bribery but as presently worded. the law is vague and cumbersome and has become a severe impediment to american trade. i do hope that the house subcommittee on telecommunications. consumer protection. and finance will produce a bill this spring so as to make full congressional approval a reaility before the end of this year. action of this matter is long overdue. i remain committed to the enactment of this bill and will do all i can to achieve that goal this year.o
s efforts to do this. and i think in the long run. tax reform will bring more ecoic efficiency to the marketplace and more respect for our tax system and our government in general. my bill proposes a temporary acrosstheboard reduction in tax expenditures. it has been called a reverse surtax. individual itemized deductions and other tax preferences would be reduced by 15 percent. the legislation attempts to be as broad as possible. it reduces the investment tax credit by 15 percent. stretches out the depreciation periods by 15 percent. and carries this 15percent reduction through to all of the myriad other exemptions. deductions. and credits in the code. such as incentive stock options. fsc benefits. deferral of tax on income of controlled foreign corporations. disallowance of certain shipping income. the caps on idbs and mortgage subsidy bonds. intangible drilling costs. percentage depletion. rehabilitation tax credits. special life insurance company deductions. and the possessions tax credits. just to name a few. the legislation is intended to be temporary and would be in effect for what i call the revenue enhancement years -of 1986 to 1990. the proposal would have almost impact on the over 60 percent of the americah people who do  itemize. but file the socalled short form. because it would  reduce the personal exemptions or the. zero bracket amount. rather it would have the greatest effect on those who are currently taking the most advantage of all the special deductions. credits. and exemptions to reduce or shelter their income under current law. in short. it raises revenue from those who  escape taxation through tax shelters. rather than from those who can avail themselves of loopholes and pay at the maximum rate for their income. the proposal generates its revenue in the following manner:
. that is why i am in favor of this resolution.  because i want strict equality in trade levels. i think a $37 billion deficit in our trade with japan is bad. but it is up to us to close the gap in our trade balance by selling goods which are competitive in terms of price and quality. if we have access. the trouble is we do  have that access. hopefully this will help gain the access that both the senator from -missouri and i care so much about. i would have preferred this senate to take a more direct and meaningful step than a binding resolution to make our views perfectly clear to the government of japan. one such direct step is a bill i introduced on march 20. s. 728. which would deny entry into the united states. of japanese telecommunications products until we are satisfied that we have true and equal access to the soon to be privatized japanese market. april 1 will come and go without any major concessions. i urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of s. 728 and request hearings be held immediately. this matter is urgent and this kind of narrowly defined retaliation has become necessary.
 reagan has requested $3.7 billion for the sdi in fiscal year 1986. this request is $2.3 billion over last years level and would more than double the programs budget in a single year. under the administrations longterm projections. total costs for the sdi will go over $60 billion before deployment occurs in the early 1990sif deployment occurs. estimates of the cost of fullscale deployment range from several hundreds of billions to over $1 trillion. we propose to cut the administrations $3.7 billion request to $1.86 billion. this appropriation would still be a 33percent increase over the fiscal year 1985 level. this bill provides a realistic approach to achieving the goals of the sdi while at the same time ackledging the constraints of the federal budget. funding at the $1.86 billion level will provide a comprehensive and vigorous research program to explore the potential of newly emerging techogies. at the same time. it will reaffirm congress commitment to the antiballistic missile treatythe principal accomplishment of strategic arms control to date. to achieve this. we would hold demonstration projects within the sdi to a 4percent increase. this would avoid creating a dangerously unstable international situation in the near term. the critical question which sdi research must answer is whether a militarily effective defensive system can perform in the face of the soviet offensive threat and countermeasures. this bill. therefore. funds the system survivability and lethality and hardening research projects at the rate the administration requested. additionally. a new program would be created called threat analysis. to research soviet countermeasures and offensive nuclear response. i urge my colleagues to view this bill as a complete package for a more realistic pursuit of the strategic defense initiative. i call for your support.e
. today i am joining my colleague. senator moynihan. in introducing a comprehensive minimum tax bill for both corporations and individuals. although the current tax code has an alternative minimum tax for individuals and an addon minimum tax for corporations. neither of these tax provisions is doing the job of insuring that all americans and corporations pay their fair share of revenues. there will be a great deal of discussion in congress this year about the need for tax reform. if congress does  achieve reform of the tax code. i believe we will face a tax revolt of major consequence in this country. while the legislation we are introducing today can by itself provide comprehensive tax reform. it does address one of the major issues in the tax reform debatethe issue of fairness. it is thus an interim step pending full consideration of comprehensive tax reform. the need for fairness is far and away the most pressing reason why we need to overhaul the u.s. tax code. the american public has kn for a long time that too many individuals and corporations do  pay their fair share. every time an american citizen reads in the newspaper that a major corporation pays income tax despite millionsor even billionsof dollars in profits. it reinforces popular distrust of the present system. polls have consistently indicated that a vast majority of the taxpaying public would  mind paying their current level of taxes if they thought that others were paying their fair share. when we read in the newspapers that this or that massive corporation pays less than the average wage earner in america. even though each reported large profits to its shareholders. we k something is wrong. according to a study by citizens for tax justice. 128 multinational corporations paid taxes for at least 1 of the years between 1981 and 1983 despite their having received $57 billion in combined profits. on the individual side of the ledger. the picture is different. statistics from the treasury department indicate that in 1983. 9.000 people earning at least $250.000 legally avoided all taxes. thousands of others came close. in 1969. when outgoing treasury secretary joseph w. barr revealed that 154 people getting more than $200.000 a year had paid federal taxes in 1967. the public was outraged. today. many americans brag about tax avoidance. the cover of a recent magazine. money. for example. featured a picture of three wealthy citizens. all sporting formal attire and holding up champagne glasses. under the headline "these three people have made fortunes but paid taxes last yearheres how you can slash yours." this perception of inequity in our tax system hurts compliance with our tax laws. as with any other law. people do  tend to obey those which they do  respect and which they do  perceive as fair. the bill i am joining in the introduction of today is designe4 to correct this situation. it would compel wealthy individuals and profitable corporations to pay a minimum tax of at least 15 percent for income over the threshold amounts-$50.000 for individuals and $100.000 in the case of corporations. the current corporate addon minimum tax would be replaced by a new alternative minimum tax. the minimum tax would apply only to income in excess of $100.000. and would work very much like the current alternative minimum tax for individuals. the corporation would compute its regular tax liability. compare it with the minimum tax and pay whichever tax is greater. the corporate minimum tax would still allow a deduction for certain net operating losses. but tax credits would be allowed to reduce the minimum tax. except the foreign tax credit and any refundable tax credits. carryovers and carrybacks of "unused" credits would be allowed. the 15percent tax rate would apply to the adjusted gross income of the corporation less the special net operating loss deduction and certain itemized deductions. preliminary estimates are that the corporate minimum tax provisions would raise $13.5 billion in the first 3 years: $3 billion in the first year. $5 billion in the second year. and $5.5 billion in the third year. the individual minimum tax provisions would raise approximately $1 billion a year. these are preliminary estimates which are subject to change and refinement. the new individual minimum tax would work very much like the current alternative minimum tax except that the number of socalled preference items would be increased and the rate would actually be lowered to 15 percent from the current 20 percent. this approach is consistent with the theory of tax reform  under consideration. namely. that we should try to broaden the base and lower rates. it should be ed that the new individual minimum tax provisions puts forth a new controversial measure for making certain that we truly have a minimum tax that works. this new approach requires individuals who earn more than $50.000 in salary or from interest or dividends actually pay a minimum of 15 percent of that income in tax. even if they subsequently go out and invest their income and lose a portion of it. there may be some harshness in this approach. but we have seen that the current system is  assuring that everyone earning over $50.000 pays at least a minimum amount in tax. this approach will be subject to heated debate. but it is -certainly worth considering. this bill thus "puts it on the table" for discussion. i look forward to the upcoming debate over comprehensive tax reform and i think the bill which senator moynihan and i are introducing today is consistent with that effort. i urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this proposal. e by mr. bentsen (for himself and mr. wallop):
. i want to express my support for the budget packagethe socalled leadership planwhich is  before us. reducing the nations massive budget deficit is the single most important action which congress can take this year to insure prosperity for our citizens. i have differences with this package and will try to have those adjusted. but it is important that we get on with the task. the goal we strive for in public service is to build a better future for our childrento turn the country over to the next generation in better shape than we found it. we  have an exciting opportunity to attain that goal. if we succeed in taking decisive action to bring down the federal deficit. our nations ecoic future will be a brilliant one. the federal deficit is clearly the most pressing problem our country faces today. perhaps that sounds like an exaggeration. looking at the national problems we debate here in the senate. which is the most serious. is it our relations with the soviets. trying to contain nuclear weapons. americans industrial competitiveness. the danger of hazardous waste. the conditions of our public schools. all of these are serious matters and each is receiving all the careful attention we are able to devote to them. but the most threatening peril to our country. because it is  yet being attended to. is our inability to live within our means. we are. this year. spending over $200 billion that we do  have. and this will grow to nearly $300 billion by 1990. our nation is borrowing one out of every four dollars we spend. it took us 196 years. which included seven major wars and the great depression. to incur a national debt of one trillion dollars. we will double that in 6 peacetime years. 1981 to 1988. we are  spending $143 billion13 percent of total federal expendituresjust to pay for the interest the principal. just the intereston the national debt. unless we do something. in 1988. interest will require 20 percent of our taxes. and upward if the deficits continue. is this the legacy we want to leave our children and future generations. but the federal deficit is  simply a problem for our children to deal with. it threatens each american. here and . large deficits threaten our ecoic recovery. they make it defficut for manufacturers to compete in the international marketplace. they discourage industrial expansion. and more importantly. they mean fewer jobs for american workers. there are some bitter pills in this package that i am  eager to swallow. if it were up to me. i would give everyone on a government retirement program a raise. but just stop and think for a moment. if a deficit reduction package is  passed. who will be hurt the mostthe ones with the least to begin with. the elderly on fixed incomes. if the deficit continues. inflation will surely rise. interest rates will go up and the essentials of lifefood. clothing. and shelterwill increase in cost beyond what any government program could protect. what kind of future will this be. remember the demographics of this country are changing. people retire  in their early sixties. their average life expectancy is for aher 15 years and probably more. today our seniors must plan for the future as never before. if the deficit grows and grows. how will these people plan for these years. if we do hing with the deficit. we are telling these people. dont plan for your retirement years. just try and get by as best. you can. this is the most unfair option before us. the federal government  has to borrow so much money to finance the growing national debt that it sops up much of the available capital. competition is keen for the small supply of available funds. this results in higher interest rates. higher interest rates make it extremely difficult for people. especially younger people. to afford to buy a home or automobile. higher interest rates also mean a slowdown in investment. making it hard for businesses to expand. this means fewer jobs and a decline in productivity. and when productivity declines. so does our standard of living. federal deficits are having a devastating effect on the ability of industries in rhode island and throughout the country to compete in world markets. the biggest threat to our ability to compete is underinvestment. in order to keep up with raid techogical changes taking place in the world today. american companies must make new investments. in modem equipment and facilities. high interest rates have led to an extremely strong dollar. causing our exports to be expensive and imports cheap. this has been extremely damaging to our exportoriented industries. we have spent a great deal of time this year discussing the difficulties in the farm belt. it is important to remember that those problems are to a considerable degree the result of our loss of agricultural sales abroad due to the strong dollar. our trade deficit was $123 billion in 1984. compared with $39 billion in 1981 and surpluses in the 1970s. this is very harmful to rhode island. where 12 percent of our manufacturing jobs are dependent on exports. manufacturers. in order to compete  only with sales overseas but sales in the united states. are moving their manufacturing facilities abroad so they can produce competitively. during hearings in the senate finance committee this past january. three distinguished ecoists from both republican and democratic administrationsmartin feldstein. charles shultze and alan greenspanall agreed on one thing. reducing the deficit is the most important step we can take to assure ecoic growth in this country. we have a precious opportunity right here and  to solve our problem. our country is relatively prosperous. but recently there have been several signs that we must act soon to resolve the deficit problem or our ecoic recovery could unravel. last week the commerce department reported that ecoic growth has slowed to 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this yearthe slowest advance since the 1982 recession. our trade deficit for the first quarter is estimated at $30 billioncompared to $26 billion for the first quarter of 1984. american factories operated at 80.8 percent of capacity in march. down from 81.2 percent in january. while these signs may  be cause for immediate alarm. they do indicate that our ecoic recovery can go into a tailspin unless we bring down interest rates and lower the dollars value abroad. we have to begin by curbing government borrowing. and that means attacking the deficit problem head on. in order to keep our ecoy on track by reducing massive government borrowing. ecoists agree and the leaders of both political parties agree that we must reduce the deficit to 2 percent of the gross national productor $100 billionby. 1988. here is a plan to do just that. the leadership budget package will reduce federal deficits by nearly $300 billion over the next 3 years. it will provide a sound foundation for continued ecoic growth that will benefit every americanwithout raising taxes. the passage of this budget plan represents far more than a challenge to reduce the deficit. it is a magnificent opportunity as wellan opportunity to assure that prosperous times will continue. an opportunity to assure that our children and future generations will continue to find productive jobs. an opportunity to assure that young couples will be able to afford homes. an opportunity to assure that small businesses will be able to expand and remain competitive. an opportunity to assure that the pruchasing power of american families will  be eroded by inflation. the approval of this package is important to the ecoic vitality of the state of rhode island. the effect of the cheap dollar brought on by massive federal deficits. is having an extremely harmful effect on our exportoriented industries. which affect the jobs of 18.000 rhode islanders. deficits cause our exports to be expensive abroad. imperiling the jobs of those who work in our export industries. the deficits are also making it difficult for our other industries to compete effectively here at home due to competition from lowcost imports. industries which employ large numbers of rhode island workerscompanies like cranston printworks. taco. and bostitch to name only a feware finding it increasingly difficult to compete with inexpensive foreign goods. the budget plan  before us will provide a more secure future for those employed in my state and every other state by making american goods more competitive. the leadership plan will also help to make it possible for young people in rhode island and in other states to afford a home. i find it extremely discouraging that the current mortgage interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage is 13.5 percent. with added "points" up front. high interest rates brought on by the deficit are placing the american dream of home ownership farther and farther beyond the grasp of our citizens. if we take positive action to reduce the deficit we will help to assure lower prices for home buyers. it has been estimated that even a 1 percentage point drop in interest rates will reduce the annual mortgage payments of the average home buyer by $600. or $50 a month. that same 1 percentage point decline in interest rates will mean an additional 300.000 home sales each year. reducing the deficit and bringing down interest rates will also improve the climate for prosperity of small businesses in rhode island and across the nation. high interest rates discourage expansion and ination. when interest rates come down. the net income of small businesses rises. and so does productivity. and this means american jobs remain secure. when interest rates decline by 2 percentage points. the estimated net increase in income is 18 percent for firms with 19 or fewer employees. and 26 percent for firms with between 20 and 99 employees. for most small businesses this can make a crucial difference in their ability to stay competitive. the choice for the future is clear. if we do hing and allow these deficits to continue unabated. every american stands to lose. but if we seize this opportunity to keep our ecoic recovery on track. every american stands to gain. this is an opportunity we can afford to pass up. we k what it is to have 21 percent prime interest rates. 12 percent inflation and 10.5 percent unemployed. e of us want those bad days to return. but if we are prepared to take action on the deficit  by approving the leadership plan. these good times can become far better. interest rates will decline. our products will compete abroad. there will be more jobs. the best is ahead. i urge my colleagues to join in supporting this package so that these goals can be realized. in closing. i want to talk directly to rhode islanders for a moment: i have worked on your behalf for many years. both as your gover and your senator. we have always shared the same goals and aspirations for ourselves and our state. as the senate works on this package in the days ahead. i will be facing many difficult choices. i will be voting on the side of those who have always wanted a chance for a good job. for our young people who want to start a family and buy a house in rhode island to keep their families together. i will be voting so that our children in high school will have a chance to go to college instead of being saddled with an emous debt. in short. my vote will be for all rhode islanders. each of whom has a dream for the future.
. i support the hatfieldgrassley amendment to reduce the level of spending for defense in the federal budget for fiscal year 1986. the adoption of this amendment is essential in order for us to succeed in cutting the federal deficit.  only will it further reduce outlaysit will demonstrate congress resolve that segment of the federal budget should be exempt from savings as we attempt to bring the deficit under control. as soon as it became apparent that decisive action was needed this year to attack the deficit problem. every senate committee began to examine the programs within its jurisdiction in the search for savings. the compromise budget package which we have adopted achieves these savings through a combination of spending freezes and reductions which touch virtually every federal program and every segment of society. programs such as mass transit. rural housing assistance. education. ecoic development. health research. and many others have been asked to help shoulder the burden of.reducing the deficit. i have supported the budget package  before us because reducing the deficit is absolutely critical in order to keep our ecoic recovery on track. one of my chief concerns has been to assure that the reductions be balanced. it is essential for the public to k that congress has acted. to the greatest extent possible. to assure that all elements of our society share in the burden of deficit reduction. the administrations original spending request for the department of defense called for an increase of 6 percent in terms of real growth in the next fiscal year. i believe such an increase would be excessive. and am pleased that the compromise plan which we have adopted reduces that increase to 3 percent. however. at a time when the deficit crisis compels sacrifice from every sector of society and every segment of the budget. we must do more. the amendment i am supporting will further reduce defense spending to zero real growth in the next fiscal year. resulting in budgetary savings of $21.5 billion next year and $115 billion over the next 3 years. this provides an additional 3year saving of $17.7 billion beyond the compromise plan which has been adopted. i do  think it is fair to ask the public to support stringent reductions in domestic programs and exempt the military from sharing part of the burden. our national security will  be imperiled if. for 1 year. we tell the pentagon to live on a diet of zero real growth. while a military "freeze"that is. providing the same number of actual dollars in 1986 as we provided in 1985would undoubtedly do harm to our shipbuilding. modernization. and conventional arms programs and could require shortsighted manpower reductions. i am convinced that the defense department could survive zero real growth with real harm to essential components of our national security. every action we take in this budget debate will affect our nations ecoic vitality. if we succeed in reducing the deficit. our ecoic future will be a brilliant one. by adopting this amendment we will help to complete the job of reducing the deficit in a way that is truly balanced and fair. i hope my colleagues will join in supporting this amendment.
 when he submits his proposal later this month. and to working with the chairman of the finance committee. who stated tonight that he plans to do everything he can to get a tax reform bill passed by the end of this year. however. in the meantime we can ige the leaky roof. enacting a minimum tax should  divert our energy from true tax reform. it is simply necessary maintenance. senator packwoods proposal would confuse tax reform with necessary repair of the tax code. he proposes to enact a minimum tax on corporations and individuals and then use the revenues raised to reduce the tax rates for individuals. reducing the tax rates and broadening the tax base are the key components of tax reform. interjecting rate reduction into the process of enacting a workable minimum tax is inappropriate and possibly counterproductive because it steals some of the themes and thus the thunder of real tax reform. in addition. any additional revenue that will be raised by fixing the current minimum tax provisions of the code should be used to reduce the federal deficit. certainly we are all aware of the agony of the. past few weeks as we struggle to cut spending programs to reduce this deficit. it simply makes sense to refuse to apply the revenues that might be raised from fixing the existing provisions in the tax code to reducing the deficit. especially since the minimum tax is directed precisely at wealthy corporations and individuals   making even a minimum contribution to deficit reduction. i support the adoption of minimum tax. but  in the form proposed by senator packwood tonight. in the context of the current budget crisis and the beginning debate on tax reform. it is  necessary or appropriate to require that a minimum tax proposal be "revenue neutral."
. it is my understanding that under the b people living off the bases who. therefore. are in houses that are paying taxes or else they are paying rent and the landlord is paying taxes to the local community. that is a typical b situation. is it .
. i rise today in support of the amendment offered by the senator from arizona . the wic program has proven emously effective in battling malnutrition among women. infants. and children. and it is important that congress assure full funding for this program. at the $1.5 billion level already appropriated for the current fiscal year. congress was clear in its intent that the wic program be funded at $1.5 bmion in fiscal year 1985.  we must act to urge that these funds be made available. or face the consequences of malnutrition in expectant mothers. newborns. and children under the age of 5consequences that last a lifetime. if action is taken. the wic program will face a shortfall of approximately $70 million. with the result that 250.000 nutritionally atrisk women and children will be removed from the rolls. for some wic recipients. it is already too late. at least eight states have already begun to remove mothers and their children from .the rolls. three more have started cutting back on the amount of food they provide. nearly all states are drawing up plans right  to take people off the program. the medical problems associated with malnutrition are already in the making. and are irreversible. we can act . or pay a very high price later. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.
. i hope this package is adopted tonight and the other body moves quickly and responsibly to get this deficit under control. if we act . interest rates will come down. we can export goods instead of jobs once again. and inflationthe cruelest thing of all to those on fixed incomeswill be held in check.
it is our intent that the section 319 funds be available to the states for the implementation by the state of its approved point source control program. by this. we do include. for example. administrative costs. educational material. technical assistance in the field at the project or land parcel level. and environmental monitoring. we do  want these funds to be used for the basic type of planning work that the federal government paid for previously with grants to states and areawide planning agencies to prepare point source programs pursuant to the provisions of section 208. we are beyond that stage . if states have  prepared those programs. then they may use either section 205(j)(2) or section 106 funds for program development. but that is  the intended use for section 319 funds. this is  a planning.program. this is an implementation program. on the subject of costsharing. these funds shall  be utilized for individual landowners to implement best management practices on their land. many states require bmps through a regulatory process. such as for sediment control. stormwater management. or mining. bmps for other sources such as agriculture are predominantly implemented through a voluntary program. we expect the existing federal programs such as the acp program. the rural clean water program. the surface mining reclamation program. and the clean water program. to be the vehicles through which the federal contribution is made to these costsharing efforts. of course. state and local governments are  precluded from using their own sources for costsharing and many of them are doing so. some states are using general obligation bonds. others are using sales taxes others are using special bond issues. there are a variety of funding alternatives which states may use to secure revenue to pay for costsharing. the exc6ption to this general policy. which we have provided for in the bill. is for demonstration projects. we also want to encourage the states to develop inative best management practices. as yet unproven in terms of their effectiveness in reducing pollution.
ial as well as congressional review. the amount of financial assistance will depend on the severity of the crisis. the revenues would come from the general fund and would likely be offset by additional revenues resulting from the disruption: increased revenues from windfall profits taxes along with revenues from the sale of spr oil. the funding would be approved in congress in an emergency supplemental appropriation. let us take steps . rather than in_ the midst of a crisis. to assure that assistance will be available for lowincome americans and emergency governmental services. i hope the senate will give this amendment favorable consideration.
you have to recall we are dealing solely with the tax on the individual. marriott corp.s tax situation is left out of this. it is the individual that escapes the tax. in other words. the individual puts up the $90.000 and the individual. in the heinz language in the legislation. if he is in a continuing care facility. he pays tax on it. if he is living with a son and the money is down at the local bank. the $90.000. he pays a tax on it. if he has managed to hang onto his or her home. and the money is in a money market certificate. he or she pays the tax on it. but if it is in one of these arrangements that the senator from pennsylvania has carved out here. that indeed includes the marriott corp. at the top of his lungs he can declaim it has hing to do with the marriott corp. but. here is the brochure. and the person puts up the money and goes into this and pays income tax on his or her money. the point is. it is unfair.
that is like saying that when you have a deposit in the bank. your interest is credited. and you pay tax on it. and then you go buy some groceries. that the grocer is taxed on it. and. therefore. there is double taxation.
that is what they call equity. you go to the marriott. they have great facilities at the marriott. two hundred acres. only one golf course. wait until next year. tax free. come one. come all. you will like it. but that poor little widow with arthritis. she has food stamps and everything. but tax her. that was the vote in the committee. we got two votes on the chafee amendment to let everybody have the same advantage. there were two votes. the senator from pennsylvania said. " we can have that. that is a bad deal."
. earlier today. we debated the question of those in living care facilitieswhethe they would be able to deposit money there in a refundable account and receive the benefits of that tax free. i tried to restrict this. i started off by believing i could restrict it considerably. and that obviously was running into difficulty. then i moved to at least restrict it to the institutions for profit. since that decision has been made rather overwhelmingly. that the senate wishes to permit those deposits in continuing care facilities to be tax free. i have an amendment which i send to the desk.
. this amendment would provide some equity. it says that anybody over 65 will be entitled to have a deposit in the amount of $90.000 and that the income from that investment would be tax free. this is to provide. as i say. some fairness. we have already decided that if you are in a continuing care facility. you can make this deposit and the interest would be tax free. for some peculiar reason. this does  apply to those in nursing homes. it does  apply to the little. old lady. arthritic. who is living by herself. it does  apply. either. in her own home or in rental quarters. so it seems to me that we should treat the elderly the same. and i think the amendment i have proposed would do this. the amendment does  discriminate against. say. only those who are in a living care facility. profit or profitmarriott or whoever else. that persons deposit of $90.000 is tax free. my amendment would provide this for everybody over 65. in the sense of equity. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
. i think we have real problems in accommodating the elderly in this nation. i challenge anybody in this senate to have more concern over the living conditions and fate of the elderly than i have. therefore. i think we ought to have hearings and see what kind of a path we can follow that really takes care of the elderly.  some little special gimmick that comes in and takes care of this select few that happens to be living in profit or profit establishments called continuing care facilities. we pointed out earlier in the debate the abuses that could come about here. a person could have $200.000 on deposit. the marriotts latest facility could require a $200.000 deposit and $1.000 a month. $500 a month. whatever. that person gets the first $90.000 of that tax free. what a bonanza for the wealthy. a person has other income of all sorts. but that $90.000. even if he is in the 50percent bracket. is tax free. the widow at home. barely getting by. just nursing along that nest egg of $90.000. all she has got. more. other income. in the 14percent bracket or whatever it is. 20percent bracket. and she is subject to the full tax. . if the manager of the bill can tell me that is fair. i challenge him to do so. when he chooses to respond. i would ask him. once we get by this tax reform measure. if we can have some hearings in the tax committee on some kind of a program that will encourage .the elderly to live in facilities. of varied kinds that might be concocted by the committee. in some way to better take care of themselves. maybe it will be an ira. the manager of the bill. the floor manager says. "what i proposed and the bill i have got before the desk is a $90.000 ira. individual retirement account act." sure. that is what it is. maybe we ought to do that. maybe it ought to be more. but clearly we have  let our imaginations function thoroughly in the legislation that is being adopted here today. bingo. in comes an amendmentody ks what it is. hearingsfor a special little group.  just the profits. the profits as well. and that is portrayed as fairness. so what i seek from the manager of the bill. the distinguished chairman of our committee. is a commitment or a promisehis word is good with methat we willhave some hearings. obviously. we can do them in the immediate futurewe are tied up with this tax reformbut thereafter dealing with this whole subject so we can do something constructive for a lot of elderly.  just that little group that is in these homes. these continuingcare facilities. but for the others that can afford to live in these facilities.
 has assigned the highest national priority to the effort of obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our men who are still missing in indochina. in this quest for a full accounting. we must  falter. vietnam. laos. and cambodia have all denied that they are still holding americans. yet these governments clearly have available to them considerably more information on missing americans then they have given to the united states. vietnam and laos. however. have recently agreed that accounting for the missing is a humanitarian issue and will cooperate in its resolution. let us hope that the information will be forthcoming. their assistance so far has been less than it should be. it would be irresponsible to rule out the possibility that live americans are still being held in indochina. we owe a. deep debt of gratitude to those who served our country in indochina. but we have a special obligation to account for those who did  return. those who serve our country. and in the futuremust k they will never be abandoned. even under trying and difficult circumstances. we must  rest until we have accounted for every individual who is missing in action.*
. i should like to read a resolution which was adopted by the republican conference of the u.s. senate today. this resolution was adopted unanimously. and we are grateful to senators armstrong and danforth for drafting what was the reflection of the views of all those present: whereas. the the republican conference of the senate of the united states expresses its appreciation for the outstanding leadership and tireless efforts of the majority leader. senator dole. and the chairman of the budget committee. senator domenici. in achieving the pending conference report on the budget resolution. and whereas. the conference finds that this budget resolution achieves significant spending reduction. but reduces the budget far less than needed. and whereas. the conference finds that. despite passage of this budget resolution. emous deficits are in prospect which threaten the ecoic future of this nation and the financial wellbeing of every family in america. and whereas. the conference finds that the magnitude of current debt and the compounding effect of interest on the national debt urgently require additional deficit reduction. and whereas. the conference finds that this budget resolution provides only a ceiling on permissible spending and that hing in this resolution is intended to prevent congress from spending less than the amounts reflected therein or from acting on the numerous and bipartisan proposals for further substantial deficit reduction. therefore. be it resolved that the congress should adopt further deficit reduction measures at the earliest available opportunity. in order to reduce deficits to more than 2 percent of the gnp in 1988 and balance the budget by 1990. that is the republican conference resolution.
s budget proposal. in addition. s. 1084 authorizes funding for the public telecommunications facilities program [ptfpi at $24 million for each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1988. this legislation will help to assure the availability of quality educational and cultural television programming in our nation. i hope my colleagues will join in supporting its passage.*
. i commend the senator from ohio for his concerns over this measure. they are concerns that i feel as well. and i have explained these concerns to the chairman of the finance committee. i was a conferee on this matter and had deep concerns over it. indeed. as the senator from ohio will remember. i presented an amendment on the floor dealing with the socalled life care provisions. and i felt very strong about that. as for the other provisions. namely. the imputed interest measures for seller financing which were reported out of the senate finance committee. i did  oppose them. however i did have concerns over the life care provisions. which i tried to strike on the floor. and i wanted to raise those concerns at the conference. well. as the senator from ohio and the distinguished chairman of the committee pointed out. we did  have a conference. there never was a conference. and that is why i refused to sign the conference report. this may be a customary procedure around here. and .i am  going to gainsay that. however. i have been here 10 years and have been named to many conferences. in my experience the conferees have actually met. or. if the conferees have  met. at least i have kn that the parties were talking back and forth and something was going on. unfortunately. that was  the case here. i was never alerted. i presume the chairmen of the two committees were talking back and forth. and i regret deeply that i did  have a chance to explain my views to the house members. my views may  have prevailed. but at least i would have received a great deal of satisfaction from addressing -these matters. about which i felt deeply. . it is  just some whim. we have a letter here addressed to the leader of the senate. senator dole. by the assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policynamely.  of the finance committee. were there conversations back and forth. to which the rest of us were  privy. maybe the other members ofthe conference committee were privy. but i certainly was . i never knew a conference was going on. whether the members of the house knew what was taking place. i do  k. that is my view of this conference report. i do  k whether the distinguished senator from ohio plans a rollcall vote or a voice vote on this conference report. but if it is a voice vote. i certainly want the chair to register that i voted ""
 and congress to reduce federal spending over the next 5 years. as we endeavor to meet these targets. it is my hope that savings will  be made at the expense of high priority domestic programs. i intend to work diligently. as i did during this years budget . process. to assure that programs serving needy americans. such as medicaid. maternal and child health. the women. infarits. and childrens nutrition program. head start. chapter 1. education of the handicapped. and othersdo  bear the brunt of efforts to reduce -the deficit. if the deficit. reduction targets are  achieved. an automatic sequestering procedure is set forth which requires acrosstheboard spending reductions for all programs. except for social security. both military and domestic spending must contribute to these savings. it is my hope that such a sequestering process will  be necessary. but the deficit crisis is an extraordinary situation. with deeply troubling consequences for our ecoy. it requires an extraordinary solution. this amendment offers us a solution. and i believe it would be irresponsible for us to ige it today. the passage of this bipartisan amendment offers us a magnificent opportunity to assure that our children and future generations will continue to find productive jobs. and buy homes. it will help to assure that small businesses will be able to expand and remain competitive. and that the purchasing power of american families will  be eroded by inflation.
. i would also like to point out that there is a great deal of support throughout our country for an increase in the excise tax on cigarettes. in february of 1984. a poll found that 77 percent of registered voters supported an increase in the tax to 32 cents a pack. that is only to 24 cents. i ask uanimous consent that the time magazine article describing these results be printed in the record at this point.
. i listed with interest to the accurate description the distinguished chairman of the finance committee gave. but i do  think he meant to give the impression that this is a bargain that everybody in the finance committee was involved in. certainly. i was never involved in any such agreement. indeed. as hast been pointed out. i made the motion for the 32 cents a pack and was defeated. but there was hing that subsequently transpired that -may be part of any agreement that the tax would remain at 16 cents.
i thank the chair. if the chair would alert me at 10 minutes. i would appreciate it. . we have here a report from the inspector general regarding the performance of eda in connection with a program that we passed in 1983. it does  pertain to the overall performance of eda in connection with every program. it is a report on edas performance in just one program. but gives us an indication of what kind of an agency it is. . that report deals with the emergency jobs act we passed 2 years ago. eda was handed $100 million. the goal of the jobs act was to stimulate employment quickly in areas suffering high unemployment. what have been the results. listen to these findings on that particular program: the eda jobs act program equated to employing 294 people for a year at a cost to the federal governmentthis is the report of the inspector general of the commerce department. -of $334.000 for every job created..nearly 2 years after the passage of the act. eda had only distributed about $54 million of the $100 million for the emergency jobs program. effort was madethis is  my language. this is the report language. effort was made to target the jobs to the unemployed. eda refused to heed warnings in a previous audit report which could have improved its administration of the program. the inspector generals report adds to the evidence that eda is  accomplising its  1 goal. which is the creation of jobs.  we move to the guaranteed loan program for various eda projects. it has been an unmitigated disaster. of edas $560 million portfolio of direct loans or acquired loan guarantees. 60 percent are  delinquent. it has approved loans for poor projects with little assurance about the borrowers ability to repay them and has given little attention to debt collection.
. we are in a situation in the united states of america where we are running a $200 billion deficit. the jobs in arkansas that the distinguished senator pointed out were lost because textile mills closed. those textile mills closed because of imports. why did the imports manage to overcome those plants in arkansas and cause threats throughout the nation as they do to my state. it is because of the high interest rates caused by the deficit. the high dollar. we just have to get this nations deficits under control or there will be repetition after repetition of closures in manufacturing industries.
. i am today introducing a bill which will make our tax policies and a number of the tax incentives that we have enacted in our tax code. consistent with some of our environmental policies. since i sit on both the finance committee and the environment and public works committee. i am involved in debate on both of these issues. and i fear that sometimes the right hand does  k what the left hand is doing in these matters. the legislation i am introducing today is designed to make our policies more consistent in these two areas. it seems only logical that we should  allow tax incentives which encourage unwanted development in areas we are seeking to protect through other tax related legislation. the bill i am introducing today would therefore eliminate various tax incentives that subsidize activities which harm certain designated natural areas of ecological significance. i have called these areas "environmental zones." important natural ecosystems are being degraded by development in many areas of the united states. for example. several hundred thousand acres of wetlands are lost each year. approximately 80 percent of this loss is attributable to agriculture. often in the form of cattle raising or forestry. and much of the remainder is linked to urban development. some of the activities which are iposing a threat to these ecosystems are encouraged and/or underwritten by tax credits and deductions. with regard to wetlands. for example. the office of techogy assessment has -concluded that: tax deductions and credits for all types of general development activities provide the most significant federal incentive for farmers to clear and drain wetlands. the bill i am introducing today would selectively deny special tax deductions and credits for activities in the designated "environmental zones." the bill would  eliminate deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses that are incurred in connection with activities carried on within these zones.  would it eliminate the ability of businesses to recover their capital expenditures in an unacccelerated manner . for projects within these zones. further. it would  limit deductions for interest or state and local taxes for businesses in* the zones. the bill is targeted to eliminate only the accelerated methods of cost recovery and the other special tax incentives. such as tax credits. for activities within the zones. you could say that i am proposing the purest form of tax reform for these zones. many of the deductions and credits i am proposing to eliminate in the zones may be cutback or eliminated as part of tax reform. if that happens. portions of this legislation may become unnecessary. however.. i suspect that any major tax reform bill will be unable to accomplish the pure reform which i am suggesting for these zones so the basic plan proposed by this legislation will be necessary even if we pass a major tax reform plan. in this bill. i am saying to wouldbe developers. "proceed if you wish. but you will get encouragement from the federal government in the way of tax breaks." there will be tax incentives for development in these zones because such incentives run directly counter to our efforts to preserve these natural areas. the areas covered by this bill are those that have already been clearly identified as important natural areas either by congress or. pursuant to other laws. by the secretaries of the interior or agriculture. aher criteria that was used to define "environmental zones" is the lack of existing authorities to manage a particular area in such a way as to assure that incompatible private activities are precluded. for example. areas designated for addition to the national wildlife refuge system are included as "environmental zones" unless such areas have been added to the system and are subject to the national wildlife refuge administration act. once such areas are subject to the laws governing management of the system. we have solved the problem of incompatible private activity being unkingly encouraged and allowed to go forward. in that instance. the special treatment .s 15118 provided by the bill would  be necessary. other areas that are included under similar conditions and for similar reasons are lands designated for addition to the national park. forest. or wild and scenic.river systems. the rationale for special treatment and the definition of "environmental zones" includes units of the coastal barrier resources act. critical habitat designated under. the endangered species act. and national natural landmarks under the historic sites. building. and antiquities act. there will be investment tax credit. accelerated depreciation. percentage depletion. immediate expensing of intangible drilling costs. special treatment for land crearing expenditures or soil and water conservation expenditures. capital gains treatment for timber. coal or iron ore. and exceptions to the at risk rule for activities in the zones. all these special tax benefits will simply be unavailable to those seeking to develop these protected areas. i look forward to holding a hearing on the bill and receiving comments from all interested parties. for example. is the definition of "environmental zone" clear egh. is it broad egh or too broad. it is time we looked at our environmental policies and tax policies together and tried to more carefully reconcile and coordinate the goals of each. i welcome the support and participation of my colleagues in this effort. i ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the record.
. i am pleased to support the outer continental shelf [ocs] revenue amendment to the budget reconciliation bill introduced by senators evans and metzenbaum. this amendment will. modify a provision in the bill to prevent a windfall revenue gain for seven states at the expense of 43 other states. section 8(g) of the ocs lands act provides for distribution of ocs revenue from the first 3 miles of federal ocs waters to affected states. this section was intended to protect states from the drainage of oil and gas underlying state waters by a federal lessee who is drilling in neighboring federal waters. in essence. states would be compensated for any dilution of their resources. the federal and affected state governments have never come to an agreement as to what constitutes fair and equitable distribution. the distribution of these funds. as provided for in the budget reconciliation bill. goes far beyond the intent of the ocs lands act. the law only requires the sharing of revenues when there is an oil or gas pool common to both federal and state submerged lands. the department of the interior estimates that only 1 to 4 percent of the oil and gas produced from the 8(g) zone comes from within the states offshore boundaries which extends 3 miles from their coastline. based on current law. the reconciliation bill provides for an overly generous distribution of revenue to affected coastal states. under a strict interpretation of drainage only. the states would receive little or distribution from the current 8(g) account and approximately $100 million over the next 30 years. in comparison. the reconciliation bill will pay coastal states $1.5 billion immediately and over $4 billion in the next 30 years. the energy committee has provided for the distribution of 27 percent of all accrued rents. bonuses and interest payments from the 8(g) zone. in addition. 27 percent of royalties would also be shared with affected states. this provision alone is expected to reduce federal revenues by $4 billion over the next 30 years. moreover. this measure provides for sharing revenues from tracts beyond the 3mile 8(g) zone. reducing federal revenues by aher $500 million. under this distribution plan. there is attempt to base the distribution on the impact of federal leases on the states resources. thus. states will share bonuses. rents and royalties where there is common pool. and. while these coastal states are benefiting from the plan. 43 other states will have to bear the tax burden. for example. if sharing future royalty revenues will reduce federal treasury receipts by $4 billion. rhode islands tax burden would correspondingly increase by $16 million over the next 30 years. this is certainly  very fair and equitable. the proposed amendment represents an effort to be fair to the affected states and responsible to the federal government and the american taxpayer. this amendment will distribute 27 percent of rent. bonus. and interest payments to the affected states. states. however. would  be allowed to recoup revenues from tracts outside of the 8(g) zone. in addition. the coastal states share of royalty revenues would be based on drainage. estimated between 1 and 4 percent. thus. royalty revenue would be shared only to the extent that the federal lease actually impacts state resources. states should  be entitled to royalty revenue unless the federal lease activity actually affects state resources. this proposed amendment follows the intent of section 8(g) of the ocs lands act. section 8(g) was  designed to be a general revenue sharing provision but rather was meant to address the problem of drainage. this amendment provides more than adequate compensation for drainage without being excessive. i urge my colleagues to join me in the support of this measure.
. dairy production has surged upward since the diversion program ended in march. there is very indication. that that trend will accelerate. as my distinguished colleague. from new york pointed out. in response to an excessive support price. dairy farmers are  only increasing their herd sizes but are also taking advantage of techogical advances to increase production per cow. just what the senator from new york said. thus thestage is set for a virtual explosion of new dairy production. . if we adopt the committee proposal without adding a 1986 price adjustment. we will simply continue along this path for a little short of 18 months. . this. according to the latest agriculture department estimates. would result in ccc purchases of more than 16 billion pounds in 1986. which gets us up to 44 million pounds a day. i want to point out that if we fall to adopt this amendment.. ccc purchases could run so high as to trigger a provision in the bill that the senator from vermont helped write. and the provisions that would be triggered would be as follows: it would require a dollar cut in the price supports in january 1988. and january 1989. . it seems to make far more sense to adopt this gradual approach than the dollar slice in 2 years. in 1988. and 1989. the amendment we propose will cut government purchases by 50 percent and dairy program costs by. we estimate. twothirds. and consumers will save about $500 million in the first yearthat is a half a billion. let us put it into billionsand $1.2 billion over the 3 years. this is what the consumers save. when the price of milk goes down. the consumers buy more. a recent study at purdue indicated that a 10percent decrease in the price of milk will increase consumption by 17 percent. that is what we all want. we want americans drinking milk. it is good for them. this amendment is straightforward and the case i believe for it is compelling. i hope my colleagues will jump at this chance to show we are serious  only about reducing our appalling budget deficit but about setting our agrliture policy on a more reasonable course. the committee. as i mentioned. has charted a. course but is  going to embark on it for more than a year and i think we can do better. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
. too often these days we hear the sentiment that america has more to lose to foreign trade than we have to gain from it. the cries for restrictions on imports assume that less trade means a better ecoic future for american industries and more jobs for our workers. hing could be further from the truth. our goal must be to generate higher levels of ecoic growth worldwide lowerso that american firms can export more. european and developing countries can better absorb our products into their markets. and third world debtors can repay their debts. e of this will come about if we contract world trade in an effort to achieve perfectly balanced trade statistics. there is question that our huge trade deficit is alarming on several accounts. in terms of trade policy. the deficit is leading to an erosion of u.s. support for open market policies. for a number of manufacturing industries. including textiles and steel. rising imports have meant a sluggish recovery from the recession rpsulting in only modest improvements in employment and profits in those industries. despite the ecoic recovery the nation has been experiencing. each of us in the senate is under pressure to solve these ecoic problems with instant gratificationprotectionism. the real solutions. though  politically attractive. are to reduce the domestic budget deficits and initiate measures aimed at greater savings in this country. aside from the attempt we are  making to balance the budget. we must also have a realistic. aggressive. reliable national trade policy. the trade enhancement act of 1985. *which i join in introducing today. is a comprehensive. bipartisan policy statement and plan of action. my reasons for  cosponsoring one of the bills titles are explained below.
 are unable to make hard choices. one of these choices may be to increase revenues. i believe it is imperative that we do everything possible to reduce spending before considering new taxes. but it will be irresponsible for us to exclude new revenues from discussion. such alternatives as a minimum corporate tax or a reduction in tax preferences would  only produce revenue to help cut the deficit. but would help to assure that the burden of deficit reduction is spread more evenly. the grammrudmanhollings plan is far from ideal. but the deficit crisis is an extraordinary situation. with deeply troubling consequences for our ecoy. it requires an extraordinary solution. this amendmentalthough far from perfectoffers us a solution. and i believe it would be irresponsible for us to ige it today. it has been said that the grammrudmanhollings plan means the end of the congressional budget process as we k it. this isa process which. though  perfect. does enable congress to assign budgetary priorities and. through reconciliation. achieve responsible savings in federal programs. it is my hope that the passage of the grammrudmanhollings amendment will instead strengthen the existing process. resulting in greater willingness to bring federal spending under control with the tools we already possess. the grammrudmanhollings plan thus poses to us an emous challenge: to pass a budget which imposes the burden of deficit reduction as fairly and swiftly as possible. it is also an opportunityto bring down the deficits and to assure that prosperous times will continue. this remains an opportunity we can afford to lose.
. you k. democracy is a pretty precious thing and the debate in this body is a pretty precious thing. i have talked with some on the other side when they have talked about debating motions to proceed and filibustering. and the answer is the rules permit it. all they are doing is acting under the rules. ladies and gentlemen. if we feel that we can go to the ultimate of the rules in this body every time and that there is comity. as it were. feeling of getting on with the business. if we are going to debate everything. have a fillbuster on the motion to proceed and then have a filibuster on the actual motion itself. and then use up our 100 hours. that is all permitted. but is that the way to do the business of the u.s. government. i do  think so. in the great issues. this hardly ranks as one of the great issues that has come before this body. in all fairness. what happens with conrail is  going to determine the future of this nation. but in the great debates in the past. those who have been involved with them and they were greater giants than we are. and i am talking about senator russell. and i am talking about those people who preceded us here. when the debate was over. when the cloture motion had been invoked. they went to the vote. the decision had been made. and we have to get on with the business of the people of the united states of america. and so i think that is the important lesson. the senator from michigan thinks we are all wrong. the rest of us do  k what we are doing. seventy of ushere are the votes: 5637. 5134. 6132. 7027. 6927. 91 to 5. that was a motion to instruct the sergeant at arms. and i suppose we got a lot of people we mally would  get on that. even though there were five who did  quite understand this business. and 63 to 33. what do you have to do to get on with the business of the united states. were we going to spend this week. next week. ad infinitum. on this business. i do  think so. let us get on. we have other tough things and the senator from michigan is a member of the budget committee and the problems with that budget make this conrail business pale in importance. that is the big measure that we ought to be dealing with. and let us get on with- it. so. i want to say i categorically reject this business that we are all guilty of participating in some conspiracy over here or we are all guilty of falsehood or untruth or illegitimate bidding was partook here or that there was defrauding. these are all statements that the senator who previously spoke used. i would hope that if people have votes. they bring them up and let us vote on it and see if we can settle" this matter once and for all and go on to other matters. thank you very much. .
. when i first came to the senate. i did  realize that senator proxmire was speaking on this every day. but when i would be here in the chamber. i would hear him speak about this geide convention. and day after day. i thought: does he speak on this every day. then i made inquiries and it turned out. yes.  only does he speak on it every day. but he has spoken on it every day for quite a while. for quite a while. how long is that. he has spoken on it every day since january 11. 1967.  there are  many senators who have even been in this chamber since 1967. so when somebody talks about dogged determination. the essence of it is right here in the senior senator from wisconsin. i wish to join in the tribute to him and also to my distinguished senior colleague from rhode island. senator pell. the ranking member of the committee. and senator lugar and the miity leader. they all have been important. but it seems to me where the credit is due really today for bringing this forward and having us vote on it is our majority leader. others have tried in the past. but he has brought it out and we are on the verge of passing it. i hope hing goes wrong. so maybe we all better  say much any more. i think we all owe him a deep debt of gratitude in the passage of this particular piece of legislation.
. before the senate recessed on february 7. i joined in as a cosponsor of this concurrent resolution disapproving the administrations request for rescission of fiscal year 1986 funds appropriated for the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention [ojjdp]. this rescission is just as objectionable as the freeze of fiscal year 1986 funds which hils been in effect for 2 months . causing undue hardship on existcontribution to our nation. further. we must  disappoint the adolescents of rhode island and many other states who need these programs to help them toward more responsible citizenship and useful lives in our society.o
madam president. in any measure. of course. there is a sense of compromise. this does  have everything that every one of us wants in it. but i think the important part is we are on the verge of getting reconciliation more importantly. in the out years. so. for that reason i am supporting the reconciliation measure and doing everything i can to forestall amendments that might result in its possible veto by the president. madam president. i do believe that this is a good measure. it is  everything that every one of us wants. but it is a major step ahead and it is reconciliation. something we have been trying to get for a long time for this fiscal year. madam president. i suggest the absence of a quorum.

 to analyze these fine recommendations and to inform the congress of the administrations plans for their implementation. for the past two decades the united states has exhibited a declining ability to compete. our productivity growth has been dismaloutstripped by almost all our trading partners. we are still the worlds strongest ecoy. yet. the question we must answer is where we will be tomorrow. we can blame all our competitiveness problems on foreign trade and the dollar. the deterioration of our trade balance began more than a decade ago. when the dollar was widely thought to be weak. some suggest that the best way to preserve american jobs is for government to erect protectionist fences to limit foreign competition in the united states. i strongly disagree. a far better alternative to protectionism is a policy that encourages american workers and industries to rise up and meet the competitive challenge. our primary problem is  the surge of imports. which always rise with strong u.s. ecoic growth. its a lack of growth in american exports. we must examine the ways in which the government hampers competitiveness through unilateral impediments to growthtax laws. securities laws. and other policies laws which inhibit research and development into new techogies and inative areas. this is what we want to receive from the administrationits overall strategy for reinstating the competitiveness of american. industry. in order to increase jobs and exports.
. that there is still a lot of fat in the budget which we should eliminate. it is clear to me that the choice grammrudmanhollings is forcing us to make should include an affirmation of educations importance. the federal budget plays a vital role in supplementing the efforts of local communities. and fine institutions of higher learning. all over the country. i k that in my state. for example. the education for the handicapped program is helping people with special needs gain the same quality education as any other child. those who administer this program. and the teachers who work with these students. make effective use of every penny they receive. aher fine example of where this money will go is the trio program. for bright high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds. trio programs. such as upward bound. have been outstandingly successful in equipping thousands of young rhode islanders with the skills they need to get into college. and to do well once they are there. as a final example. i would point out that this amendment will assist federal library programs. which are included in the education budget. in addition to the important traditional services they provide to readers. our libraries are making a strong effort to fight illiteracy. which prevents millions of americans from leading full. selfsufficient lives. i believe that as we make our difficult budget choices. these are the kinds of programs we must view as critical. and worth fighting for. education is about helping people make it in life. the programs which would benefit from the andrewshollings amendment represent investments in peoplepeople who will one day determine the course of this nation. and whom we must  neglect. i am happy to vote for this amendment. and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
 stated he sought for tax reform: fairness. simplicity. and ecoic efficiency. . let us just briefly talk about fairness. that is the overall most important achievement of this legislation. we wanted to ensure. as the senator from new york senator moynihan. pointed out previously. that persons with the same ecoic income are paying the same level of tax. and that corporations were escaping paying tax if they are profitable. that certainly is  true under the existing code. major corporations that are profitable are paying tax. that is wrong. the same is true for individuals. many extremely wealthy individuals with massive incomes are paying tax at all. this is an outrage. it is an outrage to the american people. and rightfully so. . the goal of fairness is achieved in two ways. first. by the elimination of the special deductions. credits. and exemptions that are available for certain groups of taxpayers. it is  everybody that can get these special breaks. just those who are wealthy egh to be able to invest in these tax shelters. the second major component of fairness in the legislation is the minimum tax20 percent for everybody. corporations and individuals. so this bill achieves the goal of fairness. what about simplicity. true. we have made a substantial stride toward simplicity. i do  think any tax code is going to be completely simple. and people will point out that this bill is over 800 pages. i do  k exactly how many pages it is but it is long. nevertheless. when it is all said and done. it is going to be a simpler code than we have . it will have only two rates for individuals15 percent and 27 percent. i think probably the greatest step toward achieving simplicity is the elimination of the differential for individuals between capital gains and ordinary income. i think a third of the code. and certainly a third of the time of revenue agents. is devoted to trying to distinguish what is a capital gain. what is ordinary income. that differential has been eliminated. it is all treated the same. it is counted as ordinary income what about the final goal. we sought fairness. we sought simplicity. but what about ecoic efficiency. has that been served by the proposed lower rates. gone as we have said so many times are the socalled. incentives. the purpose of these incentives was that we in the finance committee. and we in the congress thought it would be better for such and such activity to take place. thus we tried to encourage this activity through the tax code. we tried to encourage this type of exploration. this type of solar power. this type of investment in research and development. or whatever it might be. we tried to use the tax code to achieve these investment goals. what we have done in this tax reform bill is to eliminate many of those incentives. and say to the people of america. you invest your money in the fashion that you think makes the most sense to you. we believe you have some brains out there. mr. american and mrs. american. you can make the correct decisions. we are  going to have what we call an industrial policy that is dictated by the tax code of the country. with tax reform. capital should flow naturally to its most productive use. the government will  be intervening in the marketplace through the tax code.  we keep some incentives. we have carefully debated those. and members of the finance committee thought these were worthwhile incentives to keep. some are for research and development. some for historic rehabilitation. and some for lowincome housing. but we have learned our lesson about the efficiency of trying to run the country through the tax code. we ended up in this bill encouraging investment in far fewer activities than in the past because we say what we did in the past was  ecoically efficient. the current tax code provisions have resulted in too many boxcars. too many barges on the mississippi river. and too many buildings in houston that eventually ended up empty. over the last 20 years we enacted dozens of tax incentives to encourage every activity from oil wells to windmills. it happened gradually. i think most of us felt when we put these in the tax code that really they did  cost any money. we did  look at it that way. we did  realize. or perhaps did  pay as much attention as we might have. to the loss to the treasury as a result of this special incentive. this deduction. or this credit. i took a look into the history of this. i think people might be interested in these statistics. in 1970. only 15 years ago. the government collected $2.88 for every dollar of tax incentives. in other words. in 1970. there were some tax incentives in the code. but for every dollar of those incentives there was $2.88 of revenue that the government obtained.  that has been reversed.  because we have so many of these incentives. the government collects 98 cents in tax for every dollar of these incentives on the other side. i believe that as we debate this tax reform bill we ought to take to heart the lessons learned in the finance committee. the engine that is driving this legislation is the lower rates. we can start putting back into the bill a variety of special tax breaks. or we will see ineviably the tax rates climb. i am sure people are going to come and say this is a marvelous provision. it is going to create so many jobs. and all we will have to do is kick up the corporate rate 1 percent. what is the difference between 33 and 34 percent. pretty soon along will come somebody else with a wonderfully attractive provision. and all we will do is increase the top rate for individuals from 27 to 28 percent. once we start down that slippery path. we will lose the momentum we currently have. others will rise. there are 100 senators here with 200 ideas or more for incentives. and we will just be back in the pickle we were in before this legislation came along. the bill is  perfect. there are clearly going to be changes if  on the floor here. then perhaps in conference. nevertheless. i hope we can keep the amendments to a minimum. and of course act responsibly to make sure that all amendments are revenue neutral. in other words. if you want to propose amendment which loses revenue. then you will have to get the money to pay for it. one of the items that has been discussed here a lot is the individual retirement accounts. i support those. i hope some way can be worked out to preserve the individual retirement account [ira]. but i personally will  vote for a restoration of the ira if that means increasing the tax rates. i will  vote for them if it endangers the passage of this legislation. i have an amendment myself on a separate subject. it does  cost any money. that deals with the environmental matter. the socalled barrier islands.
. i oppose the amendment. the senators from the states that do  have an income tax but have a high sales tax clearly have a problem. as has ably been put forth by the senator from washington and the senator from south dakota. at the same time. in the proposed solution of their problem. they raise additional problems for the rest of us. in other words. it is the system for paying for their solution that i find objectionable. why am i opposed to their approach. for two reasons. first. because it puts the federal government back into the position. through the tax code. of choosing what is goodthat is. deductibleand what is badthat is. deductible. that is the first reason. the second reason. for specific factors that apply to the state i represent. is that what they are doing is once again. through congress. via the tax code. making the selection of what is a good deduction and what is a bad deduction. and the interest being deductible. one of the reasons why we have this tax reform proposal before us tonight and one of the reasons why it has received such high acclaim  only in the finance committee but also. i believe. on the floor of the senate and throughout the nation. one of the reasons why it has come so far. is that the people longer wish the congress of the united states. through the tax code. to be choosing what is good and what is bad. one of the major thrusts for tax reform is to get it out of that business.
. i shall restrict my remarks to that feature of the amendment of the senator from maine that restores the differential between capital gains and ordinary income. i think it is important to remember that that differential between capital gains and ordinary income was eliminated in the committee bill. let us briefly review the bidding.. the committee bill was truly revolutionary in that it eliminated practically all sheltersthose devices whereby taxpayers receive special deductions that caused certain portions of their. income  to be taxed. further. the committee bill reduced the number of tax brackets from the current 14 to 215 percent and 27 percent. that is all. six million taxpayers would be eliminated from the tax rolls. 80 percent would be paying at 15 percent. the personal exemption for lower- and middleincome taxpayers would be $2.000. finally. and most significantly. the difference in the treatment between capital gains and ordinary income would be eliminated. the committee bill thus achieves all three goals we sought when we embarked on tax reform: simplicity. fairness. and ecoic efficiency. what do we mean by ecoic efficiency. we mean by ecoic efficiency that individuals and corporations will spend their money for what they believe are the most productive purposes enticed by some tax reasoning that lures them into investments that make little sense except for the tax savings incurred thereby and the sheltering of some income. i believe it is important to k that the committee bill is a total departure from the past socalled tax reform measuresand we have seen a host of them come through here in the past 10 or 15 yearswhich tinkered with the internal revenue code. they canceled this deduction and that deduction and they added this incentive and subtracted that incentive. and they adjusted this rate up and that rate down. and they juggled the capital gains rate and they changed the amount of the individual exemption. that is what the house bill does. the house bill does this tinkering. the house bill retains capital gains. the house bill has four brackets: 15 percent. 25 percent. 35 percent. and 38 percent for individuals. the house bill does  deal with the most egregious shelters. the house bill is tax revision.  tax reform. and that is exactly what the mitchell amendment does. it is tax revision.  tax reform. the amendment of the senator from maine increases the number of brackets by adding a third at 35 percent. the senator from maine spends a good deal of time discussing the fact that some of the very rich will receive a tax cut of $53.000. and that is true. some few will receive such a cut because they are currently paying at the top rate and -thus they are paying a great deal of taxes. indeed. to receive a tax cut of $53.000 under the committee bill. the taxpayer would have to be currently paying $1.127.000 in taxes. assuming the 4.7percent average cut for those over $200.000. furthermore. if the rich are receiving 10 percent of the total tax cut. as has been stated on the floor. then i think the proponents of this amendment should at least ackledge that the group that is receiving 16 percent of the total tax cut is currently paying 22 percent of all taxes. the important point i wish to makeis that under current law. because of the shelters and because of capital gains. 67 percent of the rich60 percent of those are  raying less than 20 percent of their income in taxes. in other words. although the top rate is 50 percent. they are  paying it. sixtyseven percent are paying less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. and 43 percent of the very rich43 percent of all those with incomes over $200.000are paying less than 20 percent of their income in taxes. between shelters and capital gains. they avoid taxes and they cruise along very happily at rates far below the maximum. which is 50 percent. . the committee amendment eliminates all that. but by restoring the differential between capital gains -and ordinary income. the senator from maine is leading us into that old quagmire from which we are trying to extricate ourselves. much of the artful dodging that  takes place under our code will once again be encouraged. deal after deal will be structured to be a capital gain. the 25percent bracket will be reserved for those who are igant of the bonanza labeled "capital gain." . one final point. our nation has. over the history since the internal revenue code came into effect in 1913. been blessed with a population that traditionally has paid its taxes. . it is secret that compliance with the internal revenue code has been slipping to a discouraging and alarming degree during the past 10 or 15 years. . why is this so. why have taxpayers longer been paying with a high compliance rate. obeying the law. filing their taxes properly. the way they used to. there are two reasons. i believe. first is the intense irritation by taxpayers against a code that permits some people to pay very little or tax while the ordingy citizen. usually because of withholding on his or her wages. must pay his or her fair share. so that is the first reason compliance has failed. because of these shelters. because of capit)l gains out there which permit the rich  to pay to the extent they ought to be paying. . the second factor that has caused slippage in comiliance is that the irs agents are abie  to audit less than 2 percent of al. returns. . why is this so. why are so fei returns being audited. so few returns are being audited because the agents time is consumed to a considerable extent in trying to d.termine whether a transaction by these wealthy taxpayers is a capital gain or is ordinary income. it is estimated by treasury officials that 20 to 30 percent of the time of the irs agents is devoted to this complex task of trying to figure out whether the taxpayer has capital gain or has ordinary income. thus. the fact that. in the committee bill. we have eliminated the differential between ordinary income and capital gains means the irs agents time will be freed up so therelore they can devote it to auditing more of the tax returns that are  fiied. there is question. when there is an increased percentage of audits. there is going to be greater compliance. i think it is a fact that if most taxpayers realize they are going to be audited or might be audited. it certainly increases the chanes for compliance. . the mitchell amendment retreats from all this by restoring the capital gains differential because the amendment of the senator from maine provides all the manipulations inherent with capital gains including providing aher form of shelter for the rich. thaft is what capital gains are. i do hope that this amendment is defeated.
so that got rejected. then there comes the other possibility. about the consumer interest rate. and you get so high on the rate you lose the purpose of the bill. maybe it is as the senator from michigan is suggesting. unfair. all i can say is i personally believe that the primary objective of achieving the lower rates is a worthwhile goal and. fortunately. we have achieved it here. i will finally point out that when you are at the 15 percent tax rate. the value of the deductibility of the interest is greatly increased. if that is any solace.
$68 billion. . that money is coming from u.s. corporations. and it is coming from u.s. corporations that are able to remain competitive in the united states and in the world market because they have some international operations. this will affect all the companies that do some business abroad. some manufacturing abroad. even for parts that are integral to the unit that they produce in the united states and assemble in the united states. so it applies to the ibms. it applies to the fords. it applies to the cross pen co.. from my state that has a unit in ireland. what i think is terribly important to remember at this point. . the overseas taxes that are paid by the u.s. corporations can only receive a credit against their u.s. taxes on the same basis as their u.s. taxes would have been. in other words. if the country overseas levies a 70percent tax rate. those total dollars paid can be brought back as a credit against u.s. taxes. the taxes can only be a credit at the same rate that the u.s. company is paying taxes in the united states. 46 percent or 40 percent or whatever it might be.
. i k there is some opposition to this. and i am prepared to hear that opposition. in 1983. probably the finest step forward in the environmental field that we took was the protection of these valuable islands. which are important to the wildlife. to the ecology. to the bird life. and to human life. as a protection along our shores. they have been devastated in many instances. onethird of them are gone. but thank goodness. the u.s. congress saw fit to act in 1983 to protect those areas as best we could. if we had the money. we would buy them. but unfortunately we do  have the money. so we have taken the federal government out of the business of subsidizing the development. this is aher step in taking the federal government out of the business of subsidizing it through the tax code.
. the senator from th carolina said that we are changing the rules in the middle of the game. i would stress that under the amendment i have presented it is prospective. in other words. it does  apply to somebody who has a house there . if you have a house there  and the house is washed away. on a barrier island or a beach. you are entitled to a deduction as a loss on your income tax statement. so it goes for a developer. if his building is there already. he can take accelerated depreciation. it is prospective. etheless. i recognize the situation here. i k that the senators from south carolina and th carolina both have supported this effort when we formed those barrier islands and beaches. i remember an excellent speech that the senator from south carolina gave when we passed that barrier islands land legislation. i also remember the distinguished senior senator had objections and indeed might have been a cosponsor by the time we finished. i can recall. but. in any event. he certainly did  object. in that spirit. and recognizing that e of us want to hold up this tax bill and we want to achieve the goal. which is passage. at least in this instance. passage of the protection for these islands in the future through the tax code sections that i delineated. i would be willing to withdraw my amendment. i hope that both senators and those other senators that they mentioned would cooperate in trying to find a solution to this matter. we have a serious problem. it is true that we have given a good deal of protection through the steps we have taken. but these islands are important to the whole nation.  after all. i come from a state that has them. so i have as deep a concern as anybody. as the senator from th carolina has. likewise.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on finance be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on thursday. june 19. to conduct a hearing on the ination of lawrence gibbs to be commissioner of the internal revenue service.
 the tax bill contains a set of provisions designed to govern the taxation of socalled multipleclass mortgagebacked securities. the purpose of the provisions was to facilitate the secondary mortgage market. the provisions were originally introduced by me. and cosponsored by senator bentsen. in s. 1959. however. due to revenue considerations. the provisions as reported by the finance committee are identical to those in s. 1959. rather. the provisions as reported by committee have been sharply criticized in the industry. one of the main things that has alarmed the industry. i believe. is that the provisions in the bill prohibit the use of vehicles utilized under current law for issuing multipleclass mortgagebacked securities. i would hope that in the conference this could be changed to allow a phaseout of these vehicles over perhaps 5 years. it is my understanding that the treasury department indicated its support for some type of phaseout in testimony before the house ways and means committee on june 10. 1986. it is also my understanding that the treasury department in the same testimony suggested other changes in these provisions that would make them more workable. and i would like to pursue those suggestions as well in the conference.
. i want to bring to the attention of my distinguished colleagues a provision in the current bill which i believe is unfair. the bill eliminates cash or deferred arrangements for state and local government employees. these arrangements. also kn as 401(k) plans. allow employees to defei receipt of cash compensation and have this amount contributed to a qualified plan. under a 401(k) plan an employee is  taxed on the contribution until it is actually distributed from the plan. the current bill would eliminate 401(k) benefits for state and local government employees but retain them for the private sector and profit organizations. the recently enacted federal employee retirement system act of 1986 provides federal employees with benefits similar to those of 401(k). therefore. if this bill is enacted. every employee in this country will be able to benefit from section 401(k) except for those employed by state and local governments. there is logical explanation for the exclusion of state and local government employees from 401(k) benefits. it is unjust to discriminate against this one group. if we decide that it is a desirable policy to provide tax favored savings to employees. then i believe all employees should be able to share in the benefit equally. it is inconsistent with the goal of fairness and tax reform to provide a tax subsidy to one group of employees and to deny it to aher without justification. moreover. denying public employees 401(k) benefits it makes it far more difficult for a state or local government to attract and retain quality employees. we must  subsidize the private sector at the expense of public employers and their employees. state and local governments should be able to continue to offer 401(k) benefits to their employees. it is wrong to single them out for discrimination. i hope all my colleagues will join with me in urging the conference committee to reinstitute 401(k) benefits for public employees.
gore. humphrey. baucus. and dixon of 5 minutes each. we have routine morning business  to extend beyond 11:30 a.m.. and then at 11:30 a.m.. hopefully we will be back on s. 2638. the dod authorization bill. pending is the dole amendment 2417 in the second degree to the byrd amendment 2414. i assume by then maybe we could agree to set those amendments aside if it is all right with the miity leader and the managers could go on with whatever they had in mind. at 1 p.m.. it will be the intention of the majority leader to receive the articles of impeachment on judge clalborne from the managers on the part of the house of representatives. we have  quite worked out the second and third stages of that but we have agreed that at 1 oclock we will accept the message. and they will be here with the articles. also. it would be my intention. if there is a vote on the textile bill. if the presidents veto is overridden in the house of representatives. that we would take action on that today. i think that is the will of the principals. i have  yet had a chance to visit with the distinguished senator from south carolina. senator hollings. but i have visited with senator thurmond from south carolina. and others. it is my hope that we can reach some agreement on the two big issues that have been sort of hanging up everything around here the past couple of weeks. and that is south africa and contra aid. we had a caucus last evening. the republicans. with 41 members attending. i think it is fair to characterize that meeting as a willingness to proceed with these two issues. even some who are strongly opposed to south africa. i think would be willing to proceed if there could be some agreement on the contra vote. and some who are opposed to the contra vote would be willing to vote for cloture on the contra bill itself on the basis that we had it before the senate before. we passed it. and we should have the opportunity to vote on it again. so it seems to me that. on our side of the aisle. we at least have the seeds of potential agreement on these two highly controversial issues. i will be giving the distinguished miity leader the results of our meeting and see if we can work out some agreement. i certainly want to reiterate and underscore the comments of senator domenici last night with reference to the debt ceiling and the necessity of going to conference. hopefully today. if we could work out some agreement and release the debt ceiling from the contra and south africa controversy. then they could start the conference on the debt ceiling as soon as they could. because there are some major issues. in addition to all the christmas tree ornaments that were hung on the debt ceiling. there are some amendments that i assume will be seriously considered in the conference. one being the modification of grammrudmanhollings. that is aher reason i think it is incumbent that we try to reach some agreement on south africa and the contra aid problem. but. having said that. there is a 2 oclock vote scheduled on the cloture motion relating to s. 2638. again. there is a possibility that may be withdrawn or postponed if we can either reach an agreement or indicate that we are serious about reaching an agreement.
. however. i e that the housepassed continuing resolution includes $2.4 billion for fiscal year 1987 but does  release the remaining $600 million in fiscal year 1986 funds. the house bill also fences the money until such time as the authorizing committees complete action on the clean water act and subsequent appropriations are made. as i indicated. we are making good progress on the clean water conference. but i fear that action on the continuing resolution may be completed prior to completion of a clean water conference report. if that is the case. under the house bill. funds will be unavailable to the state due to the fencing provision. i would ask the distinguished floor manager to make every effort in conference to accept the house provision which includes $2.4 billion in fiscal year 1987 and keep the $600 million in fiscal year 1986 funds. but to oppose fencing the entire amount of money.
. h.r. 4531 extends the wetlands loan act through fiscal year 1988. allows for additional appropriations to complete acquisition of atchafalaya national wildlife refuge. la: and clarifies the language of the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act relative to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985. extension of the wetlands loan act under section 1 of the bill is a pressing national priority. we passed the wetlands loan act in 1961 to accelerate federal acquisition of migratory waterfowl habitat. this law. as amended. authorizes the appropriation of $200 million as a loan against future revenues from the sale of duck stamps. at the present cost of $7.50 per stamp. revenues are approximately $14.4 million per year. however. the acts authorization. of which about $190 million has been appropriated. expired on september 30. 1986. and. beginning october 1. 1986. 75 percent of the revenues raised from the sale of duck stamps must be used to repay the loan. only about $3.5 million would then remain available on an annual basis to purchase the necessary wetlands. this bill. h.r. 4531. therefore. is urgently needed in order to avoid a near shutdown of the nations wetlands acquisition efforts. using duck stamp funds and funds advanced against future stamp sales under the wetlands loan act. the fish and wildlife service purchased in fee title or easement approximately 1.9 million acres toward their goal from 1959 to 1977. acquisition of aher 1.9 million wetland acres for conservation of migratory birds was to be completed during the 10year period between fiscal year 1977 and fiscal year 1986. over the past decade. however. the fish and wildlife service will have acquired less than 25 percent of the 1.9 million acres of waterfowl habitat identified for federal acquisition. similarly the states have acquired only about 20 percent of the 2.5 million acres identified for state acquisition. clearly. we need to do a better job of meeting our goals. in may 1986 the united states and canada signed the "th american waterfowl management plan." which describes the actions and size of the task  believed necessary to achieve waterfowl population levels that will satisfy current public demand. the plan calls for the acquisition. protection. or improvement of approximately 1.9 million acres in the united states and 3.7 million acres in canada. the total cost for habitat protection in the united states identified by the plan approaches $500 million. the required waterfowl habitat protection and improvement in canada may reach $1 billion. the cost of providing this habitat protection will have to be shared by governmental and governmental entities in the united states and canada. section 1 of h.r. 4531 at least will allow 100 percent of the duck stamp receiptsapproximately $14 millionto continue to be used toward achievement of the goals of the plan. section 2 of h.r. 4531 makes technical changes in public law 98458. which authorized establishment of the atchafalaya national wildlife refuge. to facilitate acquisition of the refuge. the changes.allow the fish and wildlife service to alter the proposed boundaries of the refuge to incorporate those habitat areas that have been made available for acquisition and to use all funds provided under appropriations acts for acquisition of the refuge for that purpose. the atchafalaya national wildlife refuge legislation authorized the secretary of the interior to designate. with the concurrence of the state of louisiana. lands and waters considered appropriate for a national wildlife refuge within the atchafalaya basin. the lands were to be purchased with funds provided under public law 98396. a supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1984. since enactment of the refuge authorization legislation. the u.s. fish and wildlife service has been negotiating with landowners in the atchafalaya basin. the service recently reached an agreement with a large landholding company which would provide for the acquisition of over 15.000 acres of wildlife habitat within the basin for approximately $12.4 million. because some of the acreage to be purchased under this agreement falls outside the original area designated for acquisition and because additional funds are required to purchase the acreage. the legislation before us today is needed to clarify and facilitate establishment of the refuge. finally. section 3 of h.r. 4531 addresses potential technical problems relating to the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act. which were raised by passage of grammrudmanhollings. the technical change made by this bill in the migratory bird hunting and conservation ("duck") stamp act specifies that the u.s. fish and wildlife service is required to obligate only those duck stamp fund receipts which are available and that failure to obligate funds sequestered under grammrudmanhollings does  require reduction in the price of the stamp. under current law. 100 percent of the duck stamp receipts and wetland loan act appropriations from a given year must be obligated by february 1 of the following year. otherwise. the price of the duck stamp reverts to $5 from its current price of $7.50. the fear is that the sequestration of some funds in the migratory bird conservation fund under the grammrudmanhollings law could be characterized as a failure to obligate all available funds for that year and thereby require a reduction in the price of the stamp. consequently. section 3 of h.r. 4531 clarifies the language of the duck stamp act to leave doubt that the fish and wildlife service is required to obligate only those funds which are available and that failure to obligate sequestered funds does  require such a price reduction. funds in the migratory bird conservation fund which are sequestered in any given fiscal year become available. in any case. for obligation in subsequent fiscal years.
i thank my distinguished friend and colleague. the senator from maine. for those generous comments. throughout the work on this measure. working with senator mtchell has been  only an intellectual pleasure but also a great personal pleasure. he is a man who ks the act. is truly dedicated to improving the quality of the waters of our nation. at every step of the way. he was helpful and constructive. this act. -in which he generously said i had a major hand. was the result of com.bined efforts. and his part in it .was very significant. i also thank the senior senator from texas . who was helpful overall in this project. of course. our distinguished chairman of the committee. senator stafford. has made this a truly bipartisan matter. i thank the staffs as well. so it has been a thorough pleasure dealing with this matter. which has gone on for a long time. we passed the bill in the senate over a year ago. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a chart showing the fiscal years and funding levels.
i thank the senator from th dakota for making this point. the conferees recognized that many tribal governments. unlike state governments. do  yet have a regulatory program base. an underlying financial and budgetary foundation or a supporting tax infrastructure which could be used in costsharing on these programs. furthermore. funding assistance priorities should be established according to the severity of the problems identified in the epa survey.
. as we continue our deliberations on the administrations budget package. i hope more of my colleagues will join me in rejecting efforts to increase federal revenues through the imposition of a fee on domestic and imported oil.e
i certainly agree with the danger we run. i find it difficult to understand why this was brought forth. i am  questioning the motives of anybody. i k those involved feel strongly about it. but here is a jobs bill that is important across the countryit is important to michigan. to pennsylvania. to every state in the nation. we ought to get on with it. we are trying to get out of this place. we want this jobs bill to pass and pass quickly. to become effective quickly and to create jobs. and  we are risking that. how i vote today is  to be construed as my final position on withholding. as i indicated previously. i voted against it. withholding is h ing new. the democratic president. president carter. proposed withholding years ago. and we resisted that. i resisted that. but i certainly am going to resist this amendment which threatens to drag down the jobs bill with it. furthermore. i think the distinguished chairman of the finance committee has made a very valid point. we are in a recession. we are coming out of it . everything. it seems to me. hinges on this deficit. if we can bring down the deficit. which greater compliance will bring about. then the better chance of holding down the interest rates. and do  anybody think these interest rates are going to continue to go down on a slide. of course. they are . there is the threat of a curve upward. everybody says that by yesterdays paper. we are  home free. sure. the oil cartel is breaking up. opec prices seem to be coming down. all that looks favorable as far as we are concerned. but we can walk into homeplate by a long shot. the difficulty is that we need every cent we can get. we need to hold down these deficits. if the deficits stay down. then the interest rates will stay down. and that leads us to what we are most of all concerned with. reduc. ing the joblessness in the country. so i support what the chairman of the finance committee is doing this aftern. we are going to have our opportunities on other days to look at withholding. to look at it in the finance committee further. there will be other bills that it could be attached to. but this is certainly the wrong vehicle. i commend the chairman of the pinance committee in his. efforts this aftern.
. where purpose is served by retaining this tax. and industry and jobs can be helped by its elimination. there is question in my mind what we must do. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
i want to thank the distinguished senior senator from new york. who is the chief sponsor of this amendment. i should like to stress some of the points that he has made. madam president. this is a jobs bill that we are dealing with. that is why it is on the floor. this proposal is  a regional proposal. it is  going against one section of the country in favor of aher. as a matter of fact. under this proposal every single state in the nation re. ceives additional funds for their wastewater treatment facilities. what we are saying. as the senior senator from new york has just indicated. is that in the bill that has come over from the house it provides moneys that just plain can be obligated in time to create jobs. furthermore. we have taken care of the administrations proposals regarding the bureau of reclamation. as the chief sponsor of the bill just mentioned. every single cent that the administration has requested in its supplemental request dealing with the bureau of reclamation is provided for in the amendment that we are discussing this morning. hing has been taken out of the supplemental request. what we are saying is that $200 million should be taken from these funds. which are unauthorized. which can be obligated in time by the corps of engineers. and put into projects that can be obligated. that can be funded. that is the whole purpose of it. let us take a state. let us take louisiana. louisiana under this amendment receives $2.24 million for their wastewater treatment facilities. these are obligations and requirements that are backed up in louisiana. . i k that some will say that there is money already in this program that has  been obligated. the fact of the matter is that the epa in tracking this is behind. and epa. as you k. has been occupied with other things than tracking the spending and obligations of moneys under wastewater treatment. we have received word from the national league of cities. we have received word from the american metropolitan sewage agencies. which is made up of the 85 largest cities in the country. that they need these moneys. that they can use them. furthermore. madam president. i will make a statement that those in opposition to this amendment will  be able to make. that is. every cent of this money that is  obligated by the end of the fiscal year. september 30. goes back to the general treasury. . there is a claim that the supporters of the legislation as it stands on the floor can make because they k that the funds in this piece of legislation that we are considering can possibly be obligated in the required time. madam president. there came over from the house a very. very large bill dealing with water resources-$545 million. . even for those of us who are used to rather large sums. that is over a onehalf of a billion dollars. it provides $404 million for the corps of engineers. in the legislation that the senate has before it. it is $329 million. so we k there is going to be a compromise somewhat higher than the senate figure. what we are saying is that that money just can be obligated and will  end up in jobs. whereas the money we have will be obligated. we are prepared to stand behind that statement by saying that if it is  obligated by the end of this year. september 30. then it goes back into the general fund.
i just want to say briefly. . that in discussing this legislation. we can ige what the house has done. that is the point the senior senator form new york has made. inevitably. this legislation is going to go to conference. in the conference. the senate legislation is going to be increased. we k that. the house is  going to retreat completely. so what is going to happen is mammoth sums are going to end up going into the projects that the proponents of the senate bill are in favor of. they are going to get theirs. what we are saying is let us slice off a portion of this for highly needed projects that will produce jobs in every state in the nation. i thank my colleague.
 reagan has endorsed this concept and has used many of our ideas in proposing his own enterprise zone employment and development act of 1983. today i join senator bo cfwztz and a bipartisan group of 3) other senators in introducing the administrations bill. this bill is very similar to enterprise zone legislation that was favorably reported out of the senate finance committee last year. its objectives are to create jobs in targeted distressed urban and rural areas. particularly for disadvantaged workers. and to revitalize the geographic zone areas themselves. the underlying concept of this experimental program is to encourage jobcreating investment and entrepreneurial activity in the zones. this would be accomplished by providing relief from federal. state. and local taxes. and from federal. state. and local regulations. while improving some local services. the combination of all these elementsthe municipality. the state. the federal government. and the private sectorcan. we hope. create the environment necessary to revive rundown areas. because the revitalization prpgram is based on removing government burdens rather than providing government grants. it will involve federal appropriations. it will be an important complement to existing ecoic development tools. such as community development block grants. udag. job training. and antirecessionary jobs programs. eligibility of an area for enterprise zone designation will be based on criteria of poverty. unemployment. and ecoic distress. however. this will  be an automatic entitlement. rather. an eligible area will have to be inated by the city and state government. and then officially designated by hud. the federal designation process will be competitive. with 75 zones selected over 3 years. the purpose of this is to move ahead slowly. to get some experience. to see whether we are embarking down the right road before we start on a fullblown program with zones all across the nation. fourteen states have already enacted enterprise zone legislation and some have even started designating areas eligible for state and local government incentives. it is my hope that we can enact this federal legislation quickly and implement this program as soon as possible. with the active support of the administration and the 32 senate cosponsors already on board. i am confident this goal can be met. my finance subcommittee on savings. pensions. and investment policy will conduct hearings on this bill on april 22.
i do  understand the reason that the proponents have brought this legislation up . we thrashed around. lost a whole week last week. and finally got it set aside while we went to the jobs bill. and  we are on one of the most important pieces of legislation we will consider in this congress. namely saving of the social security trust fund. i personally believe we have to get on with this. we are running up against deadlines.  only are we running up against deadlines. but we have a series of other serious amendments that are going to come up. am i correct in asking the senator from kanssthere are some major amendments that are going to be proposed on the floor dealing with social security. is that  correct.
i think my real question to the senator from kansas is. as i see it: there is a sense of urgency about this matter because we have got to pass it. the conference has to pass it. we have a conference on the jobs bill to wrestle with. and we have a goodsized menu before we get out of here for the easter recess. if we do get out. and i would presumewell. i think the house is going to go anywayso the longer we take here the greater it seems to me we endanger the prospects of these two very important bills. would the senator agree with me on that.
that is the theory of it. that is the theory. that one shifts into tax exempts and his income is reduced. it is  always so. i have here a clipping from the washington post of last friday: try new investment formula. 10.13 percent. taxexempt money market and municipal bond fund. just $2.000 to open an account. total liquidityin other words. short term. unlimited checking. these are tax exempts. it says if you are in the 50percent bracket even in the 24percent bracket. 1033 it does  always work out that way.
. on april 8. 1983. four of my republican colleagues and i unveiled an alternative federal budget proposal. we believe that this spending plan. which increases revenues. lowers the rate of defense spending and restores money for many necessary social programs. will protect the ecoic recovery and provide new jobs. i ask that the summary of this budget proposal be entered into the record.
s purpose: ecoic recovery. ours is a prudent. sensible. fair and responsible budget proposal that i hope will provide the basis for a bipartisan consensus as the senate begins its debate on the 1984 budget.
. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the supplemental retirement benflit act of 1983 be printed in the kecorn at this point. there b.tti objcttion. the bill was orlermi to be printed in the recora. &r fol.ows: s. l0006 be it enuateud by the senate and house of reptesentatiue of he united states of america in congress assembled. that section 1. short title.-this act may be cited as the "supplemental retirement benefit act of 1983". sec. 2. (a) section 401 of the internal revenue code of 1954 (relating to qualified pension. profitsharing. stock bonus plans. etc.) is amended by inserting after subsection (1) the following new subsection:
. these distinguished individals call our attention again to the need to reduce deficits. i and four other republican senators. have presented an alternative budget that would accomplish this objective by reducing thb deficit to $102 billion by 1988. the budget committees resolution would reduce it to $123 billion in the same year. other senators have proposed plans. the important thing is  to get on with the work by beginning consideration of 4he budget resolution and resolving the issues of deficits. spending. and revenues that such consideration entails. i ask unanimous consent that the report referred to be included in the record.
 has an important stake in strengthening the congressional budget process. his own program of spending cuts and tax cuts could  have been enacted in 1981 without the recontiliation procedures provided by the budget process.
. today senator bentsen and i are introducing legislation amending the internal revenue code of 1954 to repeal the 30percent tax on certain interest payments received by foreigners. this bill exempts foreign persons and corporations from u.s. income and withholding taxes on interest income from debt obligations guaranteed by domestic corporations. current law levies and withholds a 30percent income tax on resident aliens and foreign corporations receiving interest payments from u.s. corporations. this 30percent tax effectively operates as a tariff. preventing the influx of foreign capital to help finance american business. one result of the current law is that in order to sell bonds and other obligations abroad. u.s. corporations must assume the cost of the withholding tax by increasing the rate of interest. accordingly. to blunt the effect of the withholding rule. u.s. corporations have established offshore finance subsidiaries that take advantage of favorable tax treaties. the most prominent of the tax havens is the netherland antilles. these financing subsidiaries erode confidence in the integrity of the u.s. tax system. promote treaty shopping. and may interfere with treaty negotiations. foreign investments provide needed capital for our own domestic business expansion and for the creation of new jobs. it is important to have access to this source of capital. repeal of the withholding requirements would benefit the u.s. ecoy in the following ways: first. more capital at lower longterm rates. increasing investment. r&d. jobs. and lowering treasury bor. rowing costs: second. reassertion of u.s. control of a large part of the offshore dollar bond market: third. allow all u.s. companies and treasury access to the worldwide dollar bond market. thus effectively ending the use of tax havens for tax avoidance. and fourth. revenue increase to treasury. estimated to be as much as $50 million. the bill applies to the following three categories of u.s. issuers: first. interest paid on obligations sold to foreign persons by finance subsidiaries prior to the enactment of this bill and later assumed by a domestic corporation. second. interest paid on new obligations sold directly or through underwriters under arrangements designed to insure their initial sale only to foreign persons. third. interest paid on obligations  in bearer form where the withholding agent has received a statement to the effect that the beneficial owner of the obligation is a foreign person. exempted from the bill is interest on commercial bank loans with foreigners. this bill has had bipartisan support in the house and senate: congressmen gns and conable have introduced a similar bill this year. the treasury departments support is demonstrated by its letter to congressman gibbons. which i ask be printed in the record following my remarks. moreover. the finance committee unanimously reported this measure in i request unanimous consent that the bill appear in the record following my remarks.
. on june 27 senator symms and i introduced a bill that would amend the internal revenue code of currently. a number of foreign countries tax income from technical services performed in the united states that relate to construction projects in that country. at that same time. income from such services is frequently taxed by our government. which results in double taxation. the added cost puts american firms at a significant disadvantage when competing for foreign projects. this .s an inequitable and unintended result of current tax laws. accordingly. our bill. s. 1550 would remove this unfair penalty by permitting u.s. firms to deduct the foreign tax on u.s. construction services. thus. we would avoid double taxation as do countries which have tax structures similar to ours (for example. canada. united kingdom. the netherlands). s. 1550 will be in the best interests of the united states. american construction firms will be on a competitive par with u.s. firms competing internationally. this means more u.s. jobs and an improved balance of trade. in addition. the ecoic stimulus of eliminating double taxation will result in an estimated increase of $100 million in annual tax revenues for the u.s. treasury. according to a study by the national constructors association. i request unanimous consent that the following two reports be printed in full in the record. the first is a study completed by arthur young and co.. while the second is an analysis undertaken by the national constructors association. both conclude that s. 1550 is a necessary reform of current tax laws.
. on june 28. senator bentsen and i introduced a bill (s. -1557) that would amend the internal revenue code of 1954 by repealing the 30percent tax on certain interest payments by u.s. corporations to foreigners. the bill has had bipartisan support in the house and senate. in addition. the treasury department supports the repeal of the withholding tax. i request unanimous consent that a report by the section of taxation of the american bar association be printed in full in the record. it highlights the need for the repeal of the 30percent tax because of the increasing abuse of international financial subsidiaries for the purpose of avoiding u.s. withholding taxes. the report also points out difficulties that the united states encounters when trying to renegotiate tax treaties with other countries because of the current 30percent tax.

. i would also like to mention that section 8 of s. 1887 increases the fiscal year 1984 authorization for title xx. the social services bloc grant. from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. the first concurrent budget resolution allowed for a $300 million increase in the program. senator bradley and i offered this amendment during the finance coinmittees consideration of the unemployment compensation extension. senators durenberger. hieinz. matsunaga. and moynntan cosponsored thle $200 million increase. this measure would provide additionalauthorization for those who are concerned with the social services block grant. namely children. providing day care centers for those who are lowincome working families and to women with work or training programs. the 1981 budget cut in title xx decreased its funding by 21 percent. one result of the cut has been welldocumented by the childrens defense fund. according to cdp. fewer children are receiving title xx child care. those hurt most by these cuts have been those lowincome working families and women in work or training programs. states have made. through necessity. the difficult choice between providing title xx assistance either to children from severly troubled families. or to children from lowincome working families. unemployment and budget cuts have added to the pressures already felt by lowincome families. the result has been an increase in reported child abuse. neglect. and requests for foster care placements. the importance of title xx can be overstated. title xx provides vital funds for a range of services for children and their families. disabled persons. and the elderly. the committee amendment will certainly help to meet the original goals of the programnhelping people attain or maintain ecoic selfsufficiency.
. i am pleased to join senator bentsen in intraducing thle life insurance tax act of 1983. this bill is identical to thle proposal which was recently considiered and approved by thle house committee on ways and means. i am introducing this measure today to bring this important piece of legislation to thle attention of my colleagues. so that a hearing can be held and the taxation of the life insurance decided by the end of this year. the ilfe insurance industry has been operating under a socalled stop gap system of taxation during this past year while a suibstantial revision of the taxation of the industry was being considered and debated. this stopgap measure expires on december 31. 1983. and thus action on the proposed revisions is necessary to prevent the disruption that further uncertainty as to the taxation of the industry could cause. thle bill contains a complete revision of the very complex laws governing the taxation of life insurance companies and represents the first such substantial revision since 1959. the main goals of this proposal are: first. to provide for a more accurate. and hopefully less complex. measure of the true ecoic income of a life insurance company. second. to strike a proper balance between the tax burdens on the two major segments of the industry and assure an appropriate level of taxation for the industry as a whole. third. to establish appropriate tax treatment for some of the new consumeroriented products being offered by insurance companies. in introducing this legislation today i want to make it clear that i am  endorsing every single provision in this very complicated proposal. rather. i am giving my support to the basic system of taxation established by the legislation and the major principles that are at the heart of this compromise proposal. i expect that this bill will be subject to careful examination during the hearing process. and it may be that changes are necessary to accomplish the goals i have outlined above. especially with regard to the appropriate level of tax that should be paid by the life insurance industry as a wvhole. i urge my colleagues to consider this matter seriously before the close of the year.*
. i send to the desk an amendment to s. 1283. a bill to amend the solid waste disposal act to authorize funds for fiscal year 1984. ca]lndar  144. and ask unanimous consent that it be printed. on may 16. 1983. the committee on environment and public works reported s. 1283 to the senate. rhat bill contained a simple 1year reauthorization of the solid waste disposal act and was reported by the committee to comply with the requirements of thle congressional budget act. a more extensive bill was developed and. on october 28. 1983. the committee reported s. 757 to the senate. calendar  500. as stated on page 1 of the report accompanying s. 757. senate report  98284. it is the intention of the committee of offer the text of s. 757 as a committeesponsored amendment to s. 1283. when the senate adopts the committeesponsored amendmnent to s. 1283. the legislative history of s. 1283 shall then include report  98284 and s. 1283. as amended. will be kn as the solid waste disposal act amendments of 1983.0
yes. . i support the work of the finance committee. it makes an important contribution to deficit reduction. and it makes necessary revisions in current law. although i. and several colleagues. will introduce shortly a comprehensive budget plan that will achieve much more substantial budget deficit reductions. i. etheless. strongly support the finance committee package.
the senator is correct. . some say we should have this. maybe we should. it is a lovely piece of candy. and i am  going to take it away from anyone. all i am saying is let us postpone it for 3 years and then we will have a chance to look at it. maybe we will be a great big wealthy country with that balanced budget we have all been seeking and. wonderful. we will take it. but how in the name of any sense of fiscal responsibility can we do it .
let me say this to the senator from arkansas: the point he makes is a valid one. but i do  have the language to do that right . here we are with a head of steam up. and i would hate to get diverted at this particular point. could i say this to the senator from arkansas: would he and his allies. those who believe as he does. pitch in and help with my amendment. then tomorrow if this passes. we would be glad to have a further amendment to the tax bill to accomplish what the senator from arkansas proposes. and i would support it. it makes sense. and i an  out to hurt anybody who mally would  be in the tax brackets if the inflation situation should continue to such an extent.
i appreciate that. let me say one other thing to everybody gathered here tonight. there are those who say. "oh. this is part of the presidents program." . that is  so. the president did  have this in his program.  when he campaigned in 1980  when he sent his proposals up to the congress in 1981. indexing was never part of it. indexing crept in. as a matter of factand the chairman of the finance committee can correct me on thisit is my memory s 4224 co that when we brought that tax bill to the floor it did  include indexing. would the senator from kansas correct me. am i right in that.
let me finish. in answer to the senators question. the answer is  if you want to pr sent something tomorrow or whatever you want to do. that is the senators business. the amendment that i have before the senate tonight only deals with the indexing of the tax code. which was an afterthought in the 1981 tax package.
i can tell the senator from idaho this: if he thinks my amendment has got tough sledding. if he added in all the provisions he has. that amendment would  even start sledding. it would be stuck before it could go anywhere. so i say let us do what we can right . if the senator wants to come forward with aher proposal. there is plenty of room. we are  going to finish tonight. as a matter of fact. i think we will probably be on this bill a good portion of tomorrow. so come forward with your measure then. but. in the meantime. strike a blow for freedom. strike a blow for fiscal responsibility. i have room for one more cosponsor. and i would be glad to have the senators name on it.
are they going to show us that the lower the taxes we pay the better off the country is. i suppose if you follow that argument to its logical conclusion. we would  pay any taxes and things would be great. we would just borrow the balance from somebody. but the truth of the matter is. ladies and gentleman. it does  take any genius to figure out that when you do  have any money. you should  embark on a $51 billion expenditure program. that is what we are doing starting in 1985. here is a chance to end that before it even starts. the people will  object one bit. i wonder how many senators have had people come up to them on the streets and say. "isnt it marvelous. in 1985 you are going to start indexing my taxes." one has said that to us. what people are interested in is how much it costs to finance their automobile and how much it costs for their children to buy a house. "when are you going to. get these interest rates under control." "when those are the questions people ask us. and are you going to do something about the federal deficit." here is a major effort to do something about it. in one single vote we will accomplish more than all that has been accomplished in about a monthandahalf in the finance committee when we struggled. huffed and puffed and finally. with herculean effort. come up with $48 billion.
. while i support the effort to obtain a deficit reduction of $100 billion as entailed in the socalled leadership plan or downpayment. i think we can do much more. and i think that the country would welcome it. the plan we offer today cuts spending by a total of $89 billion. including $24 billion of interest savings. it raises revenues by $117 billion through fiscal year 1987. the result is to reduce deficits to $164 billion in fiscal year 1985. $150 billion in fiscal year 1986. and $139 billion in fiscal year 1987. the deficit reductions thus accomplished are larger than those proposed in the socalled democratic caucus plan. or in the republican leadership plan. with regard to revenues. the plan presumes adoption of the finance committee amendment and the tax increases it entails. totaling about $48 billion. it also presumes adoption of substantial additional revenues which could be obtained in a number of ways. one of the obvious ways of raising substantial revenues is by postponing tax bracket indexing to calendar year 1988. we simply do  believe that we can afford what is effectively a tax cut of $51 billion at a moment of absolute crisis in budget policy. this is one means of raising additional revenues which seems especially appropriate. there are many others. with regard to spending. the plan projects spending cuts through fiscal year 1987 of $65 billion. of which $24 is reduced defense spending and $41 is reduced entitlement spending. the plan does  contemplate cuts in overall defense appropriations. with regard to defense spending. the plan provides a real growth rate of 3 percent. much confusion seems to surround discussions of defense spending. one major reason is that different people choose different baselines against which to apply cuts. the baseline that our plan adopts is the cbo baseline of 5 percent real growth. we use the cbos baselines for all the other accounts in the budget.  to do so for defense would be questionable. our plan cuts $24 billion in fiscal year 198587 from baseline defense spending by lowering real growth to 3 percent. for fiscal year 1985. this reduces outlays by only $3 billion. one can convince me that this is an insupportable. draconian amount. it permits total defense spending for fiscal year 1985 to be $260 billion. an increase of fully $25 billion from fiscal year 1984. with regard to entitlements. the largest single element of the budget. the plan provides a 3year reduction of $41 billion. this could result from reforms in revenue sharing. unemployment compensation. farm programs and medicare and medicaid. for example. the cbos recommendation that general revenue sharing be limited only to thowe jurisdictions experiencing fiscal distress would save $4 billion over 3 years. reforms in unemployment compensation could result. in savings of nearly $3 billion. changes in the medicare and medicald programs could include those programs already reported by the finance committee as part of the tax package. i believe there is a very substantial opportunity for savings in farm programs. saving $41 billion in entitlement spending etheless permits total entitlement spending for fiscal year 1987 to rise to $470 billion. compared to the $400 billion spend in fiscal year 1984. with regard to defen.e appropriations. the plan accepts the cbo baseline. providing therefore cuts or increases in total projected spending for these programs. relative to defense and to entitlement spending. the appropriated defense programs are a small share of the budget. particularly considering their scope. they encompass every area of domestic spending from the national parks to housing. education. and health research. yet these accounts have borne the main burden of the effort since 1981 to reduce the growth rate of government spending. and. in fact. the share of total spending taken by these programs has fallen from 24 percent in fiscal year 1980 to 17 percent in fiscal year 1984. our plan therefore provides for baseline funding. but it would also permit increases in certain high priority programs. to be offset by compensating cuts in other. lower priority programs. the result of this plan would be a substantial threeyear reduction of the deficit by $206 billion. double the reduction of the leadership plan as estimated by the cbo. on the democratic caucus plan. we believe this to be a responsible program which is needed to achieve the deficit reductions that are necessary to insure ecoic prosperity. i ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of remarks by my colleagues senators mathias. stafford. and weicker. a summary of our budget plan and an explanation be included in the record.
the senator is correct in the latter part of his statement. this was a component part of a very difficult measure. to assemble the social security compromise. there was give and take. there was a very substantial tax increase on the workers. there was a postponement of benefits for the recipients. in that there was a delay of a year in their costofliving adjustment. for those who were future retirees. as the senator remembers. everybody swallowed hard. but voted for it. there was an increase in the retirement age. starting in the year 2020. up to 66. and then to 67. taxation of benefits was also one of the integral parts.
i was listening to the debate. the question was about the effect of the tax on american wines. american wines have been suffering in competition with the imported wines but. clearly. any federal tax increase placed on american wines obviously applies to imported wines as well.
. let me say aher thing. in backing up what the senator from louisiana said. the way this thing is being paid for is through depriving the inner cities of the tax credits that have been used for the rehabilitation of older buildings. that tax credit has been one of the great incentives for the rehabilitation of the older buildings in the core cities all over the country. that is being reduced. as the senator said. we were  getting anywhere with trying to preserve those buildings and have them adopt a new life through hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in them before we went to these tax credits. but that is being whittled away under the proposal here tonight. so i join the senator from louisiana. and i hope we can prevail in this vote.
with regard to the comments of the distinguished senator from new mexico. i would comment that we can discuss this in many ways but to suddenly accuse our plan of lacking fiscal responsibility is an unusual charge because our plan costs $17 billion less than the leadership plan. if ours is fiscally irresponsible. that leaves the leadership plan fiscally irresponsible plus $17 billion. many charges can be made against our plan. we are open to those charges. and expect to be beaten over the shoulders with all sorts of accusations. but let us  use the one of fiscal irresponsibility. when we are running $200 billion deficits-$200 billion deficits for each of 3 years. which is 3 times 2 and makes it $600 billionand we come in with a downpayment package that of only $100 billion. if we can add $17 additional to that and reduce the deficit. there ought to be three cheers. if we want to argue that there is  egh for defense. or that there should be more for defense. or that we are spending too much on defenze discretionaries. ok. let us hear it. but any attack along the lines of fiscal irresponsibility i do  think holds water.
 should avoid imposing a remedy which will result in retaliation by our trading partners or make the debt situation in developing countries even worse. i ask that these editorials be printed in the record. the editorials follow: (from the washington post. june 13. 19841
. where purpose is served by retaining this tax. and industry and jobs can be helped by its elimination. there is question in my mind what we must do. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
ial or congressional appointees. it is a private groupwas set up. as i understand it. to draw building codes for the country. this was back in 1974. it was further my understanding that this group was to become selfsupporting after a certain period. instead. this budget provides a supplemental appropriation for the remainder of this fiscal year of a quarter of a million dollars. that is all right. i am  going to argue about that. whatever it is for. but thereafter it follows that there is an entitlement program set up for this group whereby it will receive up to $500.000 a year. that is half a mil. lion dollars a year in perpetuity. they autgust 8. 1984 are  supervised by anybody. i k that the appropriations committee will take a look at them  and then. but i think this is bad business. i would like an explanation by someone as to what this group does. if it is a legitimate organization then let us make an annual appropriation for them. if it is . then let them go on their way and support themselves.* sowhoever is cognizant of what this group does. i would appreciate hearing more about it.
 reagans enterprise zone initiative. the bill introduced is similar to my original proposal. first introduced in the 97th congress as s. 2298. the enterprise zone tax act of 1982. however. the bill introduced yesterday has been modified and it is identical to the provisions the senate passed this spring as part of the deficit reduction act of 1984. the senate has passed enterprise zone legislation twice since 1983. but the house has refused to consider the bill. during the recent conference on the deficit reduction act of 1984. the house conferees refused to aicept our enterprise zone provisions. even though the enterprise zone bill in the house had 257 cosponsors. yesterdays proposal is a modest experiment which may prove to be of tremendous ecoic importance to the most financially distressed areas of our country. the proposal authorizes the secretary of the department of housing and urban development to designate up to 25 areas per year. for a period of 3 years. as enterprise zones. these zones would then qualify for certain special federal tax treatment. areas would be inated by state and local governments and would have to meet certain criteria of ecoic distress and population. have a continuous boundary. and receive a commitment from the sthte and locality to take a course of action designed to remove impediments to ecoic development in the area. enterprise zones would be designated before january 1. 1985. once designated. enterprise zones would receive the following federal tax relief: an additional investment tax credit of 3 or 5 percent for personal property and 10 percent for real property for capital investment in the zone. a 10percent tax credit to employers for increases paid to zone employees over the previous year. at a maximum of 2v/ times the employers futa wage base. a tax credit for employers for wages paid to disadvantaged zone employees. equal to 50 percent of wages paid to such employees counting federal subsidies for job training. this credit would be available for 7 years and drop 10 percent per year beginning in the fourth year. a 5percent tax credit to employees in the zone for income earned in zone employment. maximum $450 per employee. capital gains tax would  be imposed on the gain from the sale of any interest in a zone business or any property used in the conduct of a zone business. the restrictions on the use of acrs for idbfinanced property. and the sunset of the small issue exemption. would  apply to idbs used to flnance zone small busness. in addition. enterprise zones would be given preference in establishing foreign trade zones. and they could qualify for limited federal regulatory relief. federal contributions would last 20 years with a 4year phaseout. the sabre foundation has conduct. ed a study of statedesignated enterprise zones. twentyone states have enacted similar enterprise zone prograins. and enterprise zones are  operational in nine states. the sabre foundation conducted interviews with and mailed questionnaires to state and local officials to assess the record of active enterprise zones in 182 communities. i am requesting that a summary of the findings of the sabre foundation study be included in the record immediately following my remarks. the study revealed that at. a state level. the enterprise zones are working to create new jobs. especially for the previously unemployed and disadvantaged. the survey also seems to indicate that the principal gains in employment are coming.  from the relocation of companies to the zones. but from the expansion of established firms and startups of small businesses. the zones also seem to have a disproportionately beneficial effect on manufacturing as a sector. the sabre foundation study is certainly  conclusive. but it does give us reason to continue to pursue this proposal on a federal level. it just may work. and i urge my other colleagues to join with us today in this experiment to revitalize and create jobs in some of the most ecoically distressed areas of our country.
i thank both senators. i say to the chairman and the ranking miity member that i was pleased that in the legislation before the senate they already have provisions dealing with "green mail"-that is. management protecting themselves by buying off threatening stockholders. furthermore. the committee has provisions in the bill dealing with the "golden parachute." which of course is outrageousand which we dealt with in the tax bill. so we are taking steps toward making management more responsible and for making the directors realize that they have duties. they are  just there as tools of management. to sit at the board meetings and sweep up  only the hoaria they mally receive but also their fees as directors for attending the meetings. it is my hope that directors in the united states will become more responsible. and certainly that is what we are striving for. . i have hing further to say on this matter. and i suggest the absence of a quorum.
madam president. today we are adopting the conference report on the defense authorization bill. this report. which represents the product of many hours of dedicated effort by the committee conferees. the senate and house leadership. and the administration. contains a number of important provisions in addition to the overall defense spending figures. several features of this bill are especially eworthy. first. the total amount of spending authorized. $297 billion. is considerably below the initial amount requested by the administration. as part of our related actions on the budget resolution and in the appropriations process. the congress will agree to an actual defense spending figure of $293 billion. compared to the administrations original request of $313 billion. our action represents a substantial reduction in defense spending. while i do  wish to detract from the fine efforts of the leadership and other senators in reaching this agreement. i do want to point out that 5 months ago this option was available to us. and had we acted upon it at that time we could have been spared much of the intervening effort and concluded our business in a much more orderly fashion. in may of this year. i and five of my colleagues introduced an amendment to the budget resolution then under consideration which would have pegged the defense appropriation at $291 billion. our proposal was narrowly rejected at that time. but it had great meritindeed. it has been adopted for all practical purposes by the congress. i applaud this action. it represents a more reasonable balance of fiscal and defense priorities. providing for roughly 5 percent real growth in defense spending while. at the same time. reducing the deficit over the next 3 years by $27.3 billion compared to the senatepassed version of the budget resolution. i believe this action affirms the merit contained in the budget amendment i offered last spring. and i congratulate the conferees on this action. the conference report also contains the substance of the amendment i cosponsored with senator bumpers and others calling for continued adherence to the policy of abiding by the unratifled salt ii treaty. the two reports which are required by this amendment in 1985 should serve as important elements in the critical discussions on arms control policy which will be held next year. both in this body and in the country at large. i am pleased that the conference had the good judgment to retain this amendment. and i congratulate the conferees. aher part of the conference agreement concerns the mx missile. as is well kn by . we will have two more opportunities next spring to examine the missile and its basing mode in the light of progress in arms control and other developments concerning the basing mode. this method of proceeding represents a responsible and prudent course. enabling us to examine carefully the issues surrounding the mx before proceeding further with deployment of the missile. i also want to mention that the conference report contains limitations on antisatellite testing. and it retains the senate amendment concerning ratification of the threshold test ban treaty. the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty. and efforts to negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty. these are important measures. and i am pleased to support them as part of the overall defense authorization.
. i am today introducing legislation that will be an alternative to the surtax that has been proposed by some as a means for raising revenue next year. i think that it is secret that the next congress is going to be faced with some very difficult choices as it attempts to reduce the growing federal deficit. spending cuts alone will  suffice. and revenue increases will in all likelihood be necessary. it is my hope that any revenue raising next year would be done in the context of tax reform. by "tax reform" i mean revising the current tax code to disperse more equitably the burden of taxation. we are all awaiting the recommendations of the treasury department study of alternative systems of taxation which is due in december. there have already been a number of major tax reform measures introduced. such as the bradleygephardt and kempkasten proposal. which i hope the congress will continue to debate and consider seriously next year. all these proposals should be examined carefully. unfortunately. i fear that the debate on tax reform may take quite a while and the pressilre to raise revenue may push the congress into considering a surtax as an immediate solution to the problem. the proposal i am introducing today is an alternative to that sort of quick fix. it is what some have called a reverse surtax. a surtax would increase the taxes of those who are already paying taxes. a surtax simply exacerbates the inequities and disparities in the levels of taxation in the current system. those who are taking advantage of the many deductions. credits. and exemptions in the tax code to reduce their taxes will continue to enjoy lower taxes. those who are paying the maximum will pay even more. before we raise the rates again to over 50 percent of any taxpayers income. i think we should call upon those who are paying less tax. as a result of all those deductions. credits. and exemptions. to make a contribution. the bill i am introducing today will take a little10 percentoff of all the socalled tax preferences. it is a "haircut." it is  designed to scalp anyone. i just want to shave a little off of all these breaks.  gouge any one industry. it will be an acrosstheboard cutback of 10 percent on most tax expenditures. this proposal should  be confused with tax reform. i have  evaluated each and every one of these deductions. credits. and exemptions and attempted to decide on the merits which should stay. which should go. and which should be modified. that would be tax reform. this legislation is aher method for a tax increase. it raises the taxes of those who are taking the most advantage of all the special tax breaks which we have put in the code. it raises the taxes of the 40 percent of all taxpayers who itemize. but it does  affect the 60 percent who file the socalled short form. many of the tax preferences. or tax expenditures in the code are working very well. for example. the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions have succeeded in encouraging home ownership and charitable giving much more efficiently and less intrusively than any federal direct spending program could ever have done. however. there are undoubtedly some of these tax breaks which may need to be revisited and examined to see whether they are working as originally intended. that process of examination will be the tax reform we will undertake next year. in the meantime. this legislation simply proposes a 10percent cutback on all of them. for example. an individual filling out his or her income tax returns will calculate all the deductions on schedules a and b as usual. but instead of deducting 100 percent of all those items. the individual will simply deduct 90 percent of the total. everyone should still have 90 percent of the tax breaks he or she had before. this sort of belttightening may pinch our personal or business budgets but it shouldnt kill anyone. this bill is very similar to a bill introduced in the house by congressman stark. h.r. 6308. and like mr. stark. i am introducing it as a discussion draft. i we).iome the comments and suggestions of my colleagues and of the public. ]."or example. i think there is still a question as to whether the cutback on credits and deductions should be the same. perhaps the cutback on tax credits should be less in order to have the same ecoic effect. in addition. this legislation has  proposed cutbacks in some business deductions. such as the deduction for salaries paid employees or the cost of goods sold. on the basis that these deductions are  tax incentives or preferences. but rather are the basic deductions necessary for calculating the actual profit of the business. this legislation is  an alternative to tax reform. it is simply a more eqilitable measure for raising revenue temporari .y if we need to while we are debdting thoroughgoing reform. i intend to work separately on tax reform measures. but in the meantime i will continue to refine this legislation. so that it can be used as an alternative to any surtax proposals.9 by mr. deconcini:
. during this congress. i have tried at various points to pass a bill which i introduced. s. 1550. to deal with the problem of the double taxation of services performed here in the united states by both the united states and foreign countries. we held hearings on this bill in the finance committee and i considered adding this measure to the deficit reduction act of 1984. however. the treasury department. while recognizing the problem. has consistently opposed the solution proposed in s. 1550. as a result. i requested that the treasury department do a study and report on the foreign taxation of fees paid to domestic companies for services performed here in the united states. the treasury department has finished this study and report which i would like to submit for the record today immediately following my remarks.
. i also do hope that we can revisit this next year. obviously. there are several parts of this bill that are deeply troubling to many of us here this evening. it seems to me some of the problems are such as the difference in the interest rate that the government borrows at and that the government loans at through the rea. i hope these matters could be addressed. and the criticisms of the congressional budget office. the administration. and some of the members of the council of ecoic advisers. there is a whole series of people who have given this very thoughtful attention. during the forthcoming year i hope these matters can be addressed. those of us who are opposed to this particular bill are  opposed to rea. we recognize the tremendous contributions it has made to the nation. we recognize the differences that come with trying to string a line out to farms that are 2. 3. and sometimes 8. 10 miles apart compared to the cost to string a line in a city where there are so many drops to houses close by. but it seems to me approaching it this way is  the best approach. so therefore. . i commend those who.have suggested we give it some careful consideration next year.
. i think we would all do well to reflect on this aspect of the intelligence profession whenever we debate or consider a matter of controversy in u.s. intelligence. we as a nation owe a debt of gratitude to people in the intelligence community that we can name. for accomplishments that can be trumpeted. i salute the men and women of our intelligence communitythose who have served. those who are presently serving. and those yet to comeand thank them for their unique sacrifice.
madam president. i would have liked to have been able to offer for consideration today a bill which i previously introduced as s. 1380. however. in view of the lateness of the hour. i have decided  to do so. this bill was passed by the senate in 1982 as part of h.r. 4717. however it was dropped in conference on the bill because the house had  held hearings on the corresponding house bill. the house committee on ways and means has  held hearings on the bill. and i think there is an excellent chance for passage in the next congress. the hearings in ways and means were held on october 3. 1984. and the treasury department testified in support of the identical house bill. h.r. 2686. in substance. my bill is designed to fully implement a piece of legislation which the congress passed in 1980the small business investment incentive act of 1980 (pl. 96477). this legislation allows certain venture capital companies. which had previously been required to register under the investment company act of 1940. to register instead as a business development company ebdc]. registration as a business development company imposes less burdensome regulatory requirements that the registration under the 1940 act. unfortunately. some companies are  taking advantage of the new registration as a bdc because if they do they will lose the beneficial tax treatment they have as a registered investment company [ric]. rics enjoy conduit tax treatment under section 851 of the internal revenue code. and thus avoid the double taxation of their earnings. this bill would allow business development companies [bdcs). which would otherwise qualify as registered investment companies. to retain their beneficial tax treatment. the treasury department supports this legislation. and the senate previously passed the legislation in 1982. it would entail a revenue loss of less than $50 million a year. the treasury department in its testimony before the house committee on ways and means on october 3. 1984. suggested three changes in the original bill which i agree should be made. and i intend to make these changes before introducing the bill again in the next congress. october ii. 1984
. i ask consent to insert text of my letter to secretary baker. urging the administration to drop the proposal limiting the tax deductibility of charitable contributions. the letter follows: hon. james a. baker. secretary of treasury. washington. dc. dear jim: my purpose in writing today is to express my very deep concern about one element of the treasury departments tax simplification proposal. namely the effect it would have upon charitable contributions. i fear that if this proposal is adopted. it will have severe repercussions upon a host of organizations in the united stateschurches. schools and universities. museums and other charitable entitieswhich rely either in whole or in part upon the generosity of taspaying americans. while limiting the deductibility of charitable contributions would  bring an end to philanthropy. such limits could very well jeopardize the programs of many private organizations and. in the case of some. put them out of business. if this were to happen. the irony would be that congress could well be deluged with new calls for increased government aid and support. thus defeating the goal of this administration to cut spending. a few figures about charitable contributions have begun to emerge since the treasury proposal was unveiled. private colleges and universities. for example. receive. on average. 11 percent of their operating funds from gifts. and the fear is growing that this percentage would fall if the deductions that could be claimed for such contributions were limited. given the administrations call for futher cutbacks in student aid. such fears are legitimate. other organizations rely far more heavily upon private gifts. ably churches and such community charities as the united way. which estimates the donations it receives could fall as much as 20 percent if the treasury proposed is adopted. i realize that a debate is  going on within the administration over the final scope of the tax simplification plan to be submitted to congress later this year. i would urge you to use your influence to drop the provisions relating to charitable deductions. i believe such provisions will  find favor with congress and will merely divert attention from the larger issue of tax reform. if. by chance. such provisions were to be adopted. they would  only cause a great deal of harm to countless private organizations which rely upon charity. but would also be counterproductive. setting off new demands for increased federal government aid which we can afford. i look forward to hearing from you on this matter. sincerely.
 would be required to submit a report to congress within 1 year of enactment of this legislation explaining steps that the united states could take to promote cooperation by other countries to prevent bribery. let us  waste aher congress. aher year. or aher month. we are losing overseas business and jobs each day we delay. u.s. trade representative brock has testified before the senate that this law alone has cost u.s. industry billions of dollars in sales and thousands of jobs. our mounting trade deficit makes further delay unjustifiable. in countries such as indonesia. and the philippines. u.s. companies are hamstrung by the fact that japanese and south korean firms frequently make large payments or provide special deals to local officials or businessmen in return for import licenses or approval of investments. such payments are subject to stiff penalties under the u.s. law. i am certainly  advocating bribery but as presently worded. the law is vague and cumbersome and has become a severe impediment to american trade. i do hope that the house subcommittee on telecommunications. consumer protection. and finance will produce a bill this spring so as to make full congressional approval a reaility before the end of this year. action of this matter is long overdue. i remain committed to the enactment of this bill and will do all i can to achieve that goal this year.o
s efforts to do this. and i think in the long run. tax reform will bring more ecoic efficiency to the marketplace and more respect for our tax system and our government in general. my bill proposes a temporary acrosstheboard reduction in tax expenditures. it has been called a reverse surtax. individual itemized deductions and other tax preferences would be reduced by 15 percent. the legislation attempts to be as broad as possible. it reduces the investment tax credit by 15 percent. stretches out the depreciation periods by 15 percent. and carries this 15percent reduction through to all of the myriad other exemptions. deductions. and credits in the code. such as incentive stock options. fsc benefits. deferral of tax on income of controlled foreign corporations. disallowance of certain shipping income. the caps on idbs and mortgage subsidy bonds. intangible drilling costs. percentage depletion. rehabilitation tax credits. special life insurance company deductions. and the possessions tax credits. just to name a few. the legislation is intended to be temporary and would be in effect for what i call the revenue enhancement years -of 1986 to 1990. the proposal would have almost impact on the over 60 percent of the americah people who do  itemize. but file the socalled short form. because it would  reduce the personal exemptions or the. zero bracket amount. rather it would have the greatest effect on those who are currently taking the most advantage of all the special deductions. credits. and exemptions to reduce or shelter their income under current law. in short. it raises revenue from those who  escape taxation through tax shelters. rather than from those who can avail themselves of loopholes and pay at the maximum rate for their income. the proposal generates its revenue in the following manner:
. that is why i am in favor of this resolution.  because i want strict equality in trade levels. i think a $37 billion deficit in our trade with japan is bad. but it is up to us to close the gap in our trade balance by selling goods which are competitive in terms of price and quality. if we have access. the trouble is we do  have that access. hopefully this will help gain the access that both the senator from -missouri and i care so much about. i would have preferred this senate to take a more direct and meaningful step than a binding resolution to make our views perfectly clear to the government of japan. one such direct step is a bill i introduced on march 20. s. 728. which would deny entry into the united states. of japanese telecommunications products until we are satisfied that we have true and equal access to the soon to be privatized japanese market. april 1 will come and go without any major concessions. i urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of s. 728 and request hearings be held immediately. this matter is urgent and this kind of narrowly defined retaliation has become necessary.
 reagan has requested $3.7 billion for the sdi in fiscal year 1986. this request is $2.3 billion over last years level and would more than double the programs budget in a single year. under the administrations longterm projections. total costs for the sdi will go over $60 billion before deployment occurs in the early 1990sif deployment occurs. estimates of the cost of fullscale deployment range from several hundreds of billions to over $1 trillion. we propose to cut the administrations $3.7 billion request to $1.86 billion. this appropriation would still be a 33percent increase over the fiscal year 1985 level. this bill provides a realistic approach to achieving the goals of the sdi while at the same time ackledging the constraints of the federal budget. funding at the $1.86 billion level will provide a comprehensive and vigorous research program to explore the potential of newly emerging techogies. at the same time. it will reaffirm congress commitment to the antiballistic missile treatythe principal accomplishment of strategic arms control to date. to achieve this. we would hold demonstration projects within the sdi to a 4percent increase. this would avoid creating a dangerously unstable international situation in the near term. the critical question which sdi research must answer is whether a militarily effective defensive system can perform in the face of the soviet offensive threat and countermeasures. this bill. therefore. funds the system survivability and lethality and hardening research projects at the rate the administration requested. additionally. a new program would be created called threat analysis. to research soviet countermeasures and offensive nuclear response. i urge my colleagues to view this bill as a complete package for a more realistic pursuit of the strategic defense initiative. i call for your support.e
. today i am joining my colleague. senator moynihan. in introducing a comprehensive minimum tax bill for both corporations and individuals. although the current tax code has an alternative minimum tax for individuals and an addon minimum tax for corporations. neither of these tax provisions is doing the job of insuring that all americans and corporations pay their fair share of revenues. there will be a great deal of discussion in congress this year about the need for tax reform. if congress does  achieve reform of the tax code. i believe we will face a tax revolt of major consequence in this country. while the legislation we are introducing today can by itself provide comprehensive tax reform. it does address one of the major issues in the tax reform debatethe issue of fairness. it is thus an interim step pending full consideration of comprehensive tax reform. the need for fairness is far and away the most pressing reason why we need to overhaul the u.s. tax code. the american public has kn for a long time that too many individuals and corporations do  pay their fair share. every time an american citizen reads in the newspaper that a major corporation pays income tax despite millionsor even billionsof dollars in profits. it reinforces popular distrust of the present system. polls have consistently indicated that a vast majority of the taxpaying public would  mind paying their current level of taxes if they thought that others were paying their fair share. when we read in the newspapers that this or that massive corporation pays less than the average wage earner in america. even though each reported large profits to its shareholders. we k something is wrong. according to a study by citizens for tax justice. 128 multinational corporations paid taxes for at least 1 of the years between 1981 and 1983 despite their having received $57 billion in combined profits. on the individual side of the ledger. the picture is different. statistics from the treasury department indicate that in 1983. 9.000 people earning at least $250.000 legally avoided all taxes. thousands of others came close. in 1969. when outgoing treasury secretary joseph w. barr revealed that 154 people getting more than $200.000 a year had paid federal taxes in 1967. the public was outraged. today. many americans brag about tax avoidance. the cover of a recent magazine. money. for example. featured a picture of three wealthy citizens. all sporting formal attire and holding up champagne glasses. under the headline "these three people have made fortunes but paid taxes last yearheres how you can slash yours." this perception of inequity in our tax system hurts compliance with our tax laws. as with any other law. people do  tend to obey those which they do  respect and which they do  perceive as fair. the bill i am joining in the introduction of today is designe4 to correct this situation. it would compel wealthy individuals and profitable corporations to pay a minimum tax of at least 15 percent for income over the threshold amounts-$50.000 for individuals and $100.000 in the case of corporations. the current corporate addon minimum tax would be replaced by a new alternative minimum tax. the minimum tax would apply only to income in excess of $100.000. and would work very much like the current alternative minimum tax for individuals. the corporation would compute its regular tax liability. compare it with the minimum tax and pay whichever tax is greater. the corporate minimum tax would still allow a deduction for certain net operating losses. but tax credits would be allowed to reduce the minimum tax. except the foreign tax credit and any refundable tax credits. carryovers and carrybacks of "unused" credits would be allowed. the 15percent tax rate would apply to the adjusted gross income of the corporation less the special net operating loss deduction and certain itemized deductions. preliminary estimates are that the corporate minimum tax provisions would raise $13.5 billion in the first 3 years: $3 billion in the first year. $5 billion in the second year. and $5.5 billion in the third year. the individual minimum tax provisions would raise approximately $1 billion a year. these are preliminary estimates which are subject to change and refinement. the new individual minimum tax would work very much like the current alternative minimum tax except that the number of socalled preference items would be increased and the rate would actually be lowered to 15 percent from the current 20 percent. this approach is consistent with the theory of tax reform  under consideration. namely. that we should try to broaden the base and lower rates. it should be ed that the new individual minimum tax provisions puts forth a new controversial measure for making certain that we truly have a minimum tax that works. this new approach requires individuals who earn more than $50.000 in salary or from interest or dividends actually pay a minimum of 15 percent of that income in tax. even if they subsequently go out and invest their income and lose a portion of it. there may be some harshness in this approach. but we have seen that the current system is  assuring that everyone earning over $50.000 pays at least a minimum amount in tax. this approach will be subject to heated debate. but it is -certainly worth considering. this bill thus "puts it on the table" for discussion. i look forward to the upcoming debate over comprehensive tax reform and i think the bill which senator moynihan and i are introducing today is consistent with that effort. i urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this proposal. e by mr. bentsen (for himself and mr. wallop):
. i want to express my support for the budget packagethe socalled leadership planwhich is  before us. reducing the nations massive budget deficit is the single most important action which congress can take this year to insure prosperity for our citizens. i have differences with this package and will try to have those adjusted. but it is important that we get on with the task. the goal we strive for in public service is to build a better future for our childrento turn the country over to the next generation in better shape than we found it. we  have an exciting opportunity to attain that goal. if we succeed in taking decisive action to bring down the federal deficit. our nations ecoic future will be a brilliant one. the federal deficit is clearly the most pressing problem our country faces today. perhaps that sounds like an exaggeration. looking at the national problems we debate here in the senate. which is the most serious. is it our relations with the soviets. trying to contain nuclear weapons. americans industrial competitiveness. the danger of hazardous waste. the conditions of our public schools. all of these are serious matters and each is receiving all the careful attention we are able to devote to them. but the most threatening peril to our country. because it is  yet being attended to. is our inability to live within our means. we are. this year. spending over $200 billion that we do  have. and this will grow to nearly $300 billion by 1990. our nation is borrowing one out of every four dollars we spend. it took us 196 years. which included seven major wars and the great depression. to incur a national debt of one trillion dollars. we will double that in 6 peacetime years. 1981 to 1988. we are  spending $143 billion13 percent of total federal expendituresjust to pay for the interest the principal. just the intereston the national debt. unless we do something. in 1988. interest will require 20 percent of our taxes. and upward if the deficits continue. is this the legacy we want to leave our children and future generations. but the federal deficit is  simply a problem for our children to deal with. it threatens each american. here and . large deficits threaten our ecoic recovery. they make it defficut for manufacturers to compete in the international marketplace. they discourage industrial expansion. and more importantly. they mean fewer jobs for american workers. there are some bitter pills in this package that i am  eager to swallow. if it were up to me. i would give everyone on a government retirement program a raise. but just stop and think for a moment. if a deficit reduction package is  passed. who will be hurt the mostthe ones with the least to begin with. the elderly on fixed incomes. if the deficit continues. inflation will surely rise. interest rates will go up and the essentials of lifefood. clothing. and shelterwill increase in cost beyond what any government program could protect. what kind of future will this be. remember the demographics of this country are changing. people retire  in their early sixties. their average life expectancy is for aher 15 years and probably more. today our seniors must plan for the future as never before. if the deficit grows and grows. how will these people plan for these years. if we do hing with the deficit. we are telling these people. dont plan for your retirement years. just try and get by as best. you can. this is the most unfair option before us. the federal government  has to borrow so much money to finance the growing national debt that it sops up much of the available capital. competition is keen for the small supply of available funds. this results in higher interest rates. higher interest rates make it extremely difficult for people. especially younger people. to afford to buy a home or automobile. higher interest rates also mean a slowdown in investment. making it hard for businesses to expand. this means fewer jobs and a decline in productivity. and when productivity declines. so does our standard of living. federal deficits are having a devastating effect on the ability of industries in rhode island and throughout the country to compete in world markets. the biggest threat to our ability to compete is underinvestment. in order to keep up with raid techogical changes taking place in the world today. american companies must make new investments. in modem equipment and facilities. high interest rates have led to an extremely strong dollar. causing our exports to be expensive and imports cheap. this has been extremely damaging to our exportoriented industries. we have spent a great deal of time this year discussing the difficulties in the farm belt. it is important to remember that those problems are to a considerable degree the result of our loss of agricultural sales abroad due to the strong dollar. our trade deficit was $123 billion in 1984. compared with $39 billion in 1981 and surpluses in the 1970s. this is very harmful to rhode island. where 12 percent of our manufacturing jobs are dependent on exports. manufacturers. in order to compete  only with sales overseas but sales in the united states. are moving their manufacturing facilities abroad so they can produce competitively. during hearings in the senate finance committee this past january. three distinguished ecoists from both republican and democratic administrationsmartin feldstein. charles shultze and alan greenspanall agreed on one thing. reducing the deficit is the most important step we can take to assure ecoic growth in this country. we have a precious opportunity right here and  to solve our problem. our country is relatively prosperous. but recently there have been several signs that we must act soon to resolve the deficit problem or our ecoic recovery could unravel. last week the commerce department reported that ecoic growth has slowed to 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this yearthe slowest advance since the 1982 recession. our trade deficit for the first quarter is estimated at $30 billioncompared to $26 billion for the first quarter of 1984. american factories operated at 80.8 percent of capacity in march. down from 81.2 percent in january. while these signs may  be cause for immediate alarm. they do indicate that our ecoic recovery can go into a tailspin unless we bring down interest rates and lower the dollars value abroad. we have to begin by curbing government borrowing. and that means attacking the deficit problem head on. in order to keep our ecoy on track by reducing massive government borrowing. ecoists agree and the leaders of both political parties agree that we must reduce the deficit to 2 percent of the gross national productor $100 billionby. 1988. here is a plan to do just that. the leadership budget package will reduce federal deficits by nearly $300 billion over the next 3 years. it will provide a sound foundation for continued ecoic growth that will benefit every americanwithout raising taxes. the passage of this budget plan represents far more than a challenge to reduce the deficit. it is a magnificent opportunity as wellan opportunity to assure that prosperous times will continue. an opportunity to assure that our children and future generations will continue to find productive jobs. an opportunity to assure that young couples will be able to afford homes. an opportunity to assure that small businesses will be able to expand and remain competitive. an opportunity to assure that the pruchasing power of american families will  be eroded by inflation. the approval of this package is important to the ecoic vitality of the state of rhode island. the effect of the cheap dollar brought on by massive federal deficits. is having an extremely harmful effect on our exportoriented industries. which affect the jobs of 18.000 rhode islanders. deficits cause our exports to be expensive abroad. imperiling the jobs of those who work in our export industries. the deficits are also making it difficult for our other industries to compete effectively here at home due to competition from lowcost imports. industries which employ large numbers of rhode island workerscompanies like cranston printworks. taco. and bostitch to name only a feware finding it increasingly difficult to compete with inexpensive foreign goods. the budget plan  before us will provide a more secure future for those employed in my state and every other state by making american goods more competitive. the leadership plan will also help to make it possible for young people in rhode island and in other states to afford a home. i find it extremely discouraging that the current mortgage interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage is 13.5 percent. with added "points" up front. high interest rates brought on by the deficit are placing the american dream of home ownership farther and farther beyond the grasp of our citizens. if we take positive action to reduce the deficit we will help to assure lower prices for home buyers. it has been estimated that even a 1 percentage point drop in interest rates will reduce the annual mortgage payments of the average home buyer by $600. or $50 a month. that same 1 percentage point decline in interest rates will mean an additional 300.000 home sales each year. reducing the deficit and bringing down interest rates will also improve the climate for prosperity of small businesses in rhode island and across the nation. high interest rates discourage expansion and ination. when interest rates come down. the net income of small businesses rises. and so does productivity. and this means american jobs remain secure. when interest rates decline by 2 percentage points. the estimated net increase in income is 18 percent for firms with 19 or fewer employees. and 26 percent for firms with between 20 and 99 employees. for most small businesses this can make a crucial difference in their ability to stay competitive. the choice for the future is clear. if we do hing and allow these deficits to continue unabated. every american stands to lose. but if we seize this opportunity to keep our ecoic recovery on track. every american stands to gain. this is an opportunity we can afford to pass up. we k what it is to have 21 percent prime interest rates. 12 percent inflation and 10.5 percent unemployed. e of us want those bad days to return. but if we are prepared to take action on the deficit  by approving the leadership plan. these good times can become far better. interest rates will decline. our products will compete abroad. there will be more jobs. the best is ahead. i urge my colleagues to join in supporting this package so that these goals can be realized. in closing. i want to talk directly to rhode islanders for a moment: i have worked on your behalf for many years. both as your gover and your senator. we have always shared the same goals and aspirations for ourselves and our state. as the senate works on this package in the days ahead. i will be facing many difficult choices. i will be voting on the side of those who have always wanted a chance for a good job. for our young people who want to start a family and buy a house in rhode island to keep their families together. i will be voting so that our children in high school will have a chance to go to college instead of being saddled with an emous debt. in short. my vote will be for all rhode islanders. each of whom has a dream for the future.
. i support the hatfieldgrassley amendment to reduce the level of spending for defense in the federal budget for fiscal year 1986. the adoption of this amendment is essential in order for us to succeed in cutting the federal deficit.  only will it further reduce outlaysit will demonstrate congress resolve that segment of the federal budget should be exempt from savings as we attempt to bring the deficit under control. as soon as it became apparent that decisive action was needed this year to attack the deficit problem. every senate committee began to examine the programs within its jurisdiction in the search for savings. the compromise budget package which we have adopted achieves these savings through a combination of spending freezes and reductions which touch virtually every federal program and every segment of society. programs such as mass transit. rural housing assistance. education. ecoic development. health research. and many others have been asked to help shoulder the burden of.reducing the deficit. i have supported the budget package  before us because reducing the deficit is absolutely critical in order to keep our ecoic recovery on track. one of my chief concerns has been to assure that the reductions be balanced. it is essential for the public to k that congress has acted. to the greatest extent possible. to assure that all elements of our society share in the burden of deficit reduction. the administrations original spending request for the department of defense called for an increase of 6 percent in terms of real growth in the next fiscal year. i believe such an increase would be excessive. and am pleased that the compromise plan which we have adopted reduces that increase to 3 percent. however. at a time when the deficit crisis compels sacrifice from every sector of society and every segment of the budget. we must do more. the amendment i am supporting will further reduce defense spending to zero real growth in the next fiscal year. resulting in budgetary savings of $21.5 billion next year and $115 billion over the next 3 years. this provides an additional 3year saving of $17.7 billion beyond the compromise plan which has been adopted. i do  think it is fair to ask the public to support stringent reductions in domestic programs and exempt the military from sharing part of the burden. our national security will  be imperiled if. for 1 year. we tell the pentagon to live on a diet of zero real growth. while a military "freeze"that is. providing the same number of actual dollars in 1986 as we provided in 1985would undoubtedly do harm to our shipbuilding. modernization. and conventional arms programs and could require shortsighted manpower reductions. i am convinced that the defense department could survive zero real growth with real harm to essential components of our national security. every action we take in this budget debate will affect our nations ecoic vitality. if we succeed in reducing the deficit. our ecoic future will be a brilliant one. by adopting this amendment we will help to complete the job of reducing the deficit in a way that is truly balanced and fair. i hope my colleagues will join in supporting this amendment.
 when he submits his proposal later this month. and to working with the chairman of the finance committee. who stated tonight that he plans to do everything he can to get a tax reform bill passed by the end of this year. however. in the meantime we can ige the leaky roof. enacting a minimum tax should  divert our energy from true tax reform. it is simply necessary maintenance. senator packwoods proposal would confuse tax reform with necessary repair of the tax code. he proposes to enact a minimum tax on corporations and individuals and then use the revenues raised to reduce the tax rates for individuals. reducing the tax rates and broadening the tax base are the key components of tax reform. interjecting rate reduction into the process of enacting a workable minimum tax is inappropriate and possibly counterproductive because it steals some of the themes and thus the thunder of real tax reform. in addition. any additional revenue that will be raised by fixing the current minimum tax provisions of the code should be used to reduce the federal deficit. certainly we are all aware of the agony of the. past few weeks as we struggle to cut spending programs to reduce this deficit. it simply makes sense to refuse to apply the revenues that might be raised from fixing the existing provisions in the tax code to reducing the deficit. especially since the minimum tax is directed precisely at wealthy corporations and individuals   making even a minimum contribution to deficit reduction. i support the adoption of minimum tax. but  in the form proposed by senator packwood tonight. in the context of the current budget crisis and the beginning debate on tax reform. it is  necessary or appropriate to require that a minimum tax proposal be "revenue neutral."
. it is my understanding that under the b people living off the bases who. therefore. are in houses that are paying taxes or else they are paying rent and the landlord is paying taxes to the local community. that is a typical b situation. is it .
. i rise today in support of the amendment offered by the senator from arizona . the wic program has proven emously effective in battling malnutrition among women. infants. and children. and it is important that congress assure full funding for this program. at the $1.5 billion level already appropriated for the current fiscal year. congress was clear in its intent that the wic program be funded at $1.5 bmion in fiscal year 1985.  we must act to urge that these funds be made available. or face the consequences of malnutrition in expectant mothers. newborns. and children under the age of 5consequences that last a lifetime. if action is taken. the wic program will face a shortfall of approximately $70 million. with the result that 250.000 nutritionally atrisk women and children will be removed from the rolls. for some wic recipients. it is already too late. at least eight states have already begun to remove mothers and their children from .the rolls. three more have started cutting back on the amount of food they provide. nearly all states are drawing up plans right  to take people off the program. the medical problems associated with malnutrition are already in the making. and are irreversible. we can act . or pay a very high price later. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.
. i hope this package is adopted tonight and the other body moves quickly and responsibly to get this deficit under control. if we act . interest rates will come down. we can export goods instead of jobs once again. and inflationthe cruelest thing of all to those on fixed incomeswill be held in check.
it is our intent that the section 319 funds be available to the states for the implementation by the state of its approved point source control program. by this. we do include. for example. administrative costs. educational material. technical assistance in the field at the project or land parcel level. and environmental monitoring. we do  want these funds to be used for the basic type of planning work that the federal government paid for previously with grants to states and areawide planning agencies to prepare point source programs pursuant to the provisions of section 208. we are beyond that stage . if states have  prepared those programs. then they may use either section 205(j)(2) or section 106 funds for program development. but that is  the intended use for section 319 funds. this is  a planning.program. this is an implementation program. on the subject of costsharing. these funds shall  be utilized for individual landowners to implement best management practices on their land. many states require bmps through a regulatory process. such as for sediment control. stormwater management. or mining. bmps for other sources such as agriculture are predominantly implemented through a voluntary program. we expect the existing federal programs such as the acp program. the rural clean water program. the surface mining reclamation program. and the clean water program. to be the vehicles through which the federal contribution is made to these costsharing efforts. of course. state and local governments are  precluded from using their own sources for costsharing and many of them are doing so. some states are using general obligation bonds. others are using sales taxes others are using special bond issues. there are a variety of funding alternatives which states may use to secure revenue to pay for costsharing. the exc6ption to this general policy. which we have provided for in the bill. is for demonstration projects. we also want to encourage the states to develop inative best management practices. as yet unproven in terms of their effectiveness in reducing pollution.
ial as well as congressional review. the amount of financial assistance will depend on the severity of the crisis. the revenues would come from the general fund and would likely be offset by additional revenues resulting from the disruption: increased revenues from windfall profits taxes along with revenues from the sale of spr oil. the funding would be approved in congress in an emergency supplemental appropriation. let us take steps . rather than in_ the midst of a crisis. to assure that assistance will be available for lowincome americans and emergency governmental services. i hope the senate will give this amendment favorable consideration.
you have to recall we are dealing solely with the tax on the individual. marriott corp.s tax situation is left out of this. it is the individual that escapes the tax. in other words. the individual puts up the $90.000 and the individual. in the heinz language in the legislation. if he is in a continuing care facility. he pays tax on it. if he is living with a son and the money is down at the local bank. the $90.000. he pays a tax on it. if he has managed to hang onto his or her home. and the money is in a money market certificate. he or she pays the tax on it. but if it is in one of these arrangements that the senator from pennsylvania has carved out here. that indeed includes the marriott corp. at the top of his lungs he can declaim it has hing to do with the marriott corp. but. here is the brochure. and the person puts up the money and goes into this and pays income tax on his or her money. the point is. it is unfair.
that is like saying that when you have a deposit in the bank. your interest is credited. and you pay tax on it. and then you go buy some groceries. that the grocer is taxed on it. and. therefore. there is double taxation.
that is what they call equity. you go to the marriott. they have great facilities at the marriott. two hundred acres. only one golf course. wait until next year. tax free. come one. come all. you will like it. but that poor little widow with arthritis. she has food stamps and everything. but tax her. that was the vote in the committee. we got two votes on the chafee amendment to let everybody have the same advantage. there were two votes. the senator from pennsylvania said. " we can have that. that is a bad deal."
. earlier today. we debated the question of those in living care facilitieswhethe they would be able to deposit money there in a refundable account and receive the benefits of that tax free. i tried to restrict this. i started off by believing i could restrict it considerably. and that obviously was running into difficulty. then i moved to at least restrict it to the institutions for profit. since that decision has been made rather overwhelmingly. that the senate wishes to permit those deposits in continuing care facilities to be tax free. i have an amendment which i send to the desk.
. this amendment would provide some equity. it says that anybody over 65 will be entitled to have a deposit in the amount of $90.000 and that the income from that investment would be tax free. this is to provide. as i say. some fairness. we have already decided that if you are in a continuing care facility. you can make this deposit and the interest would be tax free. for some peculiar reason. this does  apply to those in nursing homes. it does  apply to the little. old lady. arthritic. who is living by herself. it does  apply. either. in her own home or in rental quarters. so it seems to me that we should treat the elderly the same. and i think the amendment i have proposed would do this. the amendment does  discriminate against. say. only those who are in a living care facility. profit or profitmarriott or whoever else. that persons deposit of $90.000 is tax free. my amendment would provide this for everybody over 65. in the sense of equity. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
. i think we have real problems in accommodating the elderly in this nation. i challenge anybody in this senate to have more concern over the living conditions and fate of the elderly than i have. therefore. i think we ought to have hearings and see what kind of a path we can follow that really takes care of the elderly.  some little special gimmick that comes in and takes care of this select few that happens to be living in profit or profit establishments called continuing care facilities. we pointed out earlier in the debate the abuses that could come about here. a person could have $200.000 on deposit. the marriotts latest facility could require a $200.000 deposit and $1.000 a month. $500 a month. whatever. that person gets the first $90.000 of that tax free. what a bonanza for the wealthy. a person has other income of all sorts. but that $90.000. even if he is in the 50percent bracket. is tax free. the widow at home. barely getting by. just nursing along that nest egg of $90.000. all she has got. more. other income. in the 14percent bracket or whatever it is. 20percent bracket. and she is subject to the full tax. . if the manager of the bill can tell me that is fair. i challenge him to do so. when he chooses to respond. i would ask him. once we get by this tax reform measure. if we can have some hearings in the tax committee on some kind of a program that will encourage .the elderly to live in facilities. of varied kinds that might be concocted by the committee. in some way to better take care of themselves. maybe it will be an ira. the manager of the bill. the floor manager says. "what i proposed and the bill i have got before the desk is a $90.000 ira. individual retirement account act." sure. that is what it is. maybe we ought to do that. maybe it ought to be more. but clearly we have  let our imaginations function thoroughly in the legislation that is being adopted here today. bingo. in comes an amendmentody ks what it is. hearingsfor a special little group.  just the profits. the profits as well. and that is portrayed as fairness. so what i seek from the manager of the bill. the distinguished chairman of our committee. is a commitment or a promisehis word is good with methat we willhave some hearings. obviously. we can do them in the immediate futurewe are tied up with this tax reformbut thereafter dealing with this whole subject so we can do something constructive for a lot of elderly.  just that little group that is in these homes. these continuingcare facilities. but for the others that can afford to live in these facilities.
 has assigned the highest national priority to the effort of obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our men who are still missing in indochina. in this quest for a full accounting. we must  falter. vietnam. laos. and cambodia have all denied that they are still holding americans. yet these governments clearly have available to them considerably more information on missing americans then they have given to the united states. vietnam and laos. however. have recently agreed that accounting for the missing is a humanitarian issue and will cooperate in its resolution. let us hope that the information will be forthcoming. their assistance so far has been less than it should be. it would be irresponsible to rule out the possibility that live americans are still being held in indochina. we owe a. deep debt of gratitude to those who served our country in indochina. but we have a special obligation to account for those who did  return. those who serve our country. and in the futuremust k they will never be abandoned. even under trying and difficult circumstances. we must  rest until we have accounted for every individual who is missing in action.*
. i should like to read a resolution which was adopted by the republican conference of the u.s. senate today. this resolution was adopted unanimously. and we are grateful to senators armstrong and danforth for drafting what was the reflection of the views of all those present: whereas. the the republican conference of the senate of the united states expresses its appreciation for the outstanding leadership and tireless efforts of the majority leader. senator dole. and the chairman of the budget committee. senator domenici. in achieving the pending conference report on the budget resolution. and whereas. the conference finds that this budget resolution achieves significant spending reduction. but reduces the budget far less than needed. and whereas. the conference finds that. despite passage of this budget resolution. emous deficits are in prospect which threaten the ecoic future of this nation and the financial wellbeing of every family in america. and whereas. the conference finds that the magnitude of current debt and the compounding effect of interest on the national debt urgently require additional deficit reduction. and whereas. the conference finds that this budget resolution provides only a ceiling on permissible spending and that hing in this resolution is intended to prevent congress from spending less than the amounts reflected therein or from acting on the numerous and bipartisan proposals for further substantial deficit reduction. therefore. be it resolved that the congress should adopt further deficit reduction measures at the earliest available opportunity. in order to reduce deficits to more than 2 percent of the gnp in 1988 and balance the budget by 1990. that is the republican conference resolution.
s budget proposal. in addition. s. 1084 authorizes funding for the public telecommunications facilities program [ptfpi at $24 million for each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1988. this legislation will help to assure the availability of quality educational and cultural television programming in our nation. i hope my colleagues will join in supporting its passage.*
. i commend the senator from ohio for his concerns over this measure. they are concerns that i feel as well. and i have explained these concerns to the chairman of the finance committee. i was a conferee on this matter and had deep concerns over it. indeed. as the senator from ohio will remember. i presented an amendment on the floor dealing with the socalled life care provisions. and i felt very strong about that. as for the other provisions. namely. the imputed interest measures for seller financing which were reported out of the senate finance committee. i did  oppose them. however i did have concerns over the life care provisions. which i tried to strike on the floor. and i wanted to raise those concerns at the conference. well. as the senator from ohio and the distinguished chairman of the committee pointed out. we did  have a conference. there never was a conference. and that is why i refused to sign the conference report. this may be a customary procedure around here. and .i am  going to gainsay that. however. i have been here 10 years and have been named to many conferences. in my experience the conferees have actually met. or. if the conferees have  met. at least i have kn that the parties were talking back and forth and something was going on. unfortunately. that was  the case here. i was never alerted. i presume the chairmen of the two committees were talking back and forth. and i regret deeply that i did  have a chance to explain my views to the house members. my views may  have prevailed. but at least i would have received a great deal of satisfaction from addressing -these matters. about which i felt deeply. . it is  just some whim. we have a letter here addressed to the leader of the senate. senator dole. by the assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policynamely.  of the finance committee. were there conversations back and forth. to which the rest of us were  privy. maybe the other members ofthe conference committee were privy. but i certainly was . i never knew a conference was going on. whether the members of the house knew what was taking place. i do  k. that is my view of this conference report. i do  k whether the distinguished senator from ohio plans a rollcall vote or a voice vote on this conference report. but if it is a voice vote. i certainly want the chair to register that i voted ""
 and congress to reduce federal spending over the next 5 years. as we endeavor to meet these targets. it is my hope that savings will  be made at the expense of high priority domestic programs. i intend to work diligently. as i did during this years budget . process. to assure that programs serving needy americans. such as medicaid. maternal and child health. the women. infarits. and childrens nutrition program. head start. chapter 1. education of the handicapped. and othersdo  bear the brunt of efforts to reduce -the deficit. if the deficit. reduction targets are  achieved. an automatic sequestering procedure is set forth which requires acrosstheboard spending reductions for all programs. except for social security. both military and domestic spending must contribute to these savings. it is my hope that such a sequestering process will  be necessary. but the deficit crisis is an extraordinary situation. with deeply troubling consequences for our ecoy. it requires an extraordinary solution. this amendment offers us a solution. and i believe it would be irresponsible for us to ige it today. the passage of this bipartisan amendment offers us a magnificent opportunity to assure that our children and future generations will continue to find productive jobs. and buy homes. it will help to assure that small businesses will be able to expand and remain competitive. and that the purchasing power of american families will  be eroded by inflation.
. i would also like to point out that there is a great deal of support throughout our country for an increase in the excise tax on cigarettes. in february of 1984. a poll found that 77 percent of registered voters supported an increase in the tax to 32 cents a pack. that is only to 24 cents. i ask uanimous consent that the time magazine article describing these results be printed in the record at this point.
. i listed with interest to the accurate description the distinguished chairman of the finance committee gave. but i do  think he meant to give the impression that this is a bargain that everybody in the finance committee was involved in. certainly. i was never involved in any such agreement. indeed. as hast been pointed out. i made the motion for the 32 cents a pack and was defeated. but there was hing that subsequently transpired that -may be part of any agreement that the tax would remain at 16 cents.
i thank the chair. if the chair would alert me at 10 minutes. i would appreciate it. . we have here a report from the inspector general regarding the performance of eda in connection with a program that we passed in 1983. it does  pertain to the overall performance of eda in connection with every program. it is a report on edas performance in just one program. but gives us an indication of what kind of an agency it is. . that report deals with the emergency jobs act we passed 2 years ago. eda was handed $100 million. the goal of the jobs act was to stimulate employment quickly in areas suffering high unemployment. what have been the results. listen to these findings on that particular program: the eda jobs act program equated to employing 294 people for a year at a cost to the federal governmentthis is the report of the inspector general of the commerce department. -of $334.000 for every job created..nearly 2 years after the passage of the act. eda had only distributed about $54 million of the $100 million for the emergency jobs program. effort was madethis is  my language. this is the report language. effort was made to target the jobs to the unemployed. eda refused to heed warnings in a previous audit report which could have improved its administration of the program. the inspector generals report adds to the evidence that eda is  accomplising its  1 goal. which is the creation of jobs.  we move to the guaranteed loan program for various eda projects. it has been an unmitigated disaster. of edas $560 million portfolio of direct loans or acquired loan guarantees. 60 percent are  delinquent. it has approved loans for poor projects with little assurance about the borrowers ability to repay them and has given little attention to debt collection.
. we are in a situation in the united states of america where we are running a $200 billion deficit. the jobs in arkansas that the distinguished senator pointed out were lost because textile mills closed. those textile mills closed because of imports. why did the imports manage to overcome those plants in arkansas and cause threats throughout the nation as they do to my state. it is because of the high interest rates caused by the deficit. the high dollar. we just have to get this nations deficits under control or there will be repetition after repetition of closures in manufacturing industries.
. i am today introducing a bill which will make our tax policies and a number of the tax incentives that we have enacted in our tax code. consistent with some of our environmental policies. since i sit on both the finance committee and the environment and public works committee. i am involved in debate on both of these issues. and i fear that sometimes the right hand does  k what the left hand is doing in these matters. the legislation i am introducing today is designed to make our policies more consistent in these two areas. it seems only logical that we should  allow tax incentives which encourage unwanted development in areas we are seeking to protect through other tax related legislation. the bill i am introducing today would therefore eliminate various tax incentives that subsidize activities which harm certain designated natural areas of ecological significance. i have called these areas "environmental zones." important natural ecosystems are being degraded by development in many areas of the united states. for example. several hundred thousand acres of wetlands are lost each year. approximately 80 percent of this loss is attributable to agriculture. often in the form of cattle raising or forestry. and much of the remainder is linked to urban development. some of the activities which are iposing a threat to these ecosystems are encouraged and/or underwritten by tax credits and deductions. with regard to wetlands. for example. the office of techogy assessment has -concluded that: tax deductions and credits for all types of general development activities provide the most significant federal incentive for farmers to clear and drain wetlands. the bill i am introducing today would selectively deny special tax deductions and credits for activities in the designated "environmental zones." the bill would  eliminate deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses that are incurred in connection with activities carried on within these zones.  would it eliminate the ability of businesses to recover their capital expenditures in an unacccelerated manner . for projects within these zones. further. it would  limit deductions for interest or state and local taxes for businesses in* the zones. the bill is targeted to eliminate only the accelerated methods of cost recovery and the other special tax incentives. such as tax credits. for activities within the zones. you could say that i am proposing the purest form of tax reform for these zones. many of the deductions and credits i am proposing to eliminate in the zones may be cutback or eliminated as part of tax reform. if that happens. portions of this legislation may become unnecessary. however.. i suspect that any major tax reform bill will be unable to accomplish the pure reform which i am suggesting for these zones so the basic plan proposed by this legislation will be necessary even if we pass a major tax reform plan. in this bill. i am saying to wouldbe developers. "proceed if you wish. but you will get encouragement from the federal government in the way of tax breaks." there will be tax incentives for development in these zones because such incentives run directly counter to our efforts to preserve these natural areas. the areas covered by this bill are those that have already been clearly identified as important natural areas either by congress or. pursuant to other laws. by the secretaries of the interior or agriculture. aher criteria that was used to define "environmental zones" is the lack of existing authorities to manage a particular area in such a way as to assure that incompatible private activities are precluded. for example. areas designated for addition to the national wildlife refuge system are included as "environmental zones" unless such areas have been added to the system and are subject to the national wildlife refuge administration act. once such areas are subject to the laws governing management of the system. we have solved the problem of incompatible private activity being unkingly encouraged and allowed to go forward. in that instance. the special treatment .s 15118 provided by the bill would  be necessary. other areas that are included under similar conditions and for similar reasons are lands designated for addition to the national park. forest. or wild and scenic.river systems. the rationale for special treatment and the definition of "environmental zones" includes units of the coastal barrier resources act. critical habitat designated under. the endangered species act. and national natural landmarks under the historic sites. building. and antiquities act. there will be investment tax credit. accelerated depreciation. percentage depletion. immediate expensing of intangible drilling costs. special treatment for land crearing expenditures or soil and water conservation expenditures. capital gains treatment for timber. coal or iron ore. and exceptions to the at risk rule for activities in the zones. all these special tax benefits will simply be unavailable to those seeking to develop these protected areas. i look forward to holding a hearing on the bill and receiving comments from all interested parties. for example. is the definition of "environmental zone" clear egh. is it broad egh or too broad. it is time we looked at our environmental policies and tax policies together and tried to more carefully reconcile and coordinate the goals of each. i welcome the support and participation of my colleagues in this effort. i ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the record.
. i am pleased to support the outer continental shelf [ocs] revenue amendment to the budget reconciliation bill introduced by senators evans and metzenbaum. this amendment will. modify a provision in the bill to prevent a windfall revenue gain for seven states at the expense of 43 other states. section 8(g) of the ocs lands act provides for distribution of ocs revenue from the first 3 miles of federal ocs waters to affected states. this section was intended to protect states from the drainage of oil and gas underlying state waters by a federal lessee who is drilling in neighboring federal waters. in essence. states would be compensated for any dilution of their resources. the federal and affected state governments have never come to an agreement as to what constitutes fair and equitable distribution. the distribution of these funds. as provided for in the budget reconciliation bill. goes far beyond the intent of the ocs lands act. the law only requires the sharing of revenues when there is an oil or gas pool common to both federal and state submerged lands. the department of the interior estimates that only 1 to 4 percent of the oil and gas produced from the 8(g) zone comes from within the states offshore boundaries which extends 3 miles from their coastline. based on current law. the reconciliation bill provides for an overly generous distribution of revenue to affected coastal states. under a strict interpretation of drainage only. the states would receive little or distribution from the current 8(g) account and approximately $100 million over the next 30 years. in comparison. the reconciliation bill will pay coastal states $1.5 billion immediately and over $4 billion in the next 30 years. the energy committee has provided for the distribution of 27 percent of all accrued rents. bonuses and interest payments from the 8(g) zone. in addition. 27 percent of royalties would also be shared with affected states. this provision alone is expected to reduce federal revenues by $4 billion over the next 30 years. moreover. this measure provides for sharing revenues from tracts beyond the 3mile 8(g) zone. reducing federal revenues by aher $500 million. under this distribution plan. there is attempt to base the distribution on the impact of federal leases on the states resources. thus. states will share bonuses. rents and royalties where there is common pool. and. while these coastal states are benefiting from the plan. 43 other states will have to bear the tax burden. for example. if sharing future royalty revenues will reduce federal treasury receipts by $4 billion. rhode islands tax burden would correspondingly increase by $16 million over the next 30 years. this is certainly  very fair and equitable. the proposed amendment represents an effort to be fair to the affected states and responsible to the federal government and the american taxpayer. this amendment will distribute 27 percent of rent. bonus. and interest payments to the affected states. states. however. would  be allowed to recoup revenues from tracts outside of the 8(g) zone. in addition. the coastal states share of royalty revenues would be based on drainage. estimated between 1 and 4 percent. thus. royalty revenue would be shared only to the extent that the federal lease actually impacts state resources. states should  be entitled to royalty revenue unless the federal lease activity actually affects state resources. this proposed amendment follows the intent of section 8(g) of the ocs lands act. section 8(g) was  designed to be a general revenue sharing provision but rather was meant to address the problem of drainage. this amendment provides more than adequate compensation for drainage without being excessive. i urge my colleagues to join me in the support of this measure.
. dairy production has surged upward since the diversion program ended in march. there is very indication. that that trend will accelerate. as my distinguished colleague. from new york pointed out. in response to an excessive support price. dairy farmers are  only increasing their herd sizes but are also taking advantage of techogical advances to increase production per cow. just what the senator from new york said. thus thestage is set for a virtual explosion of new dairy production. . if we adopt the committee proposal without adding a 1986 price adjustment. we will simply continue along this path for a little short of 18 months. . this. according to the latest agriculture department estimates. would result in ccc purchases of more than 16 billion pounds in 1986. which gets us up to 44 million pounds a day. i want to point out that if we fall to adopt this amendment.. ccc purchases could run so high as to trigger a provision in the bill that the senator from vermont helped write. and the provisions that would be triggered would be as follows: it would require a dollar cut in the price supports in january 1988. and january 1989. . it seems to make far more sense to adopt this gradual approach than the dollar slice in 2 years. in 1988. and 1989. the amendment we propose will cut government purchases by 50 percent and dairy program costs by. we estimate. twothirds. and consumers will save about $500 million in the first yearthat is a half a billion. let us put it into billionsand $1.2 billion over the 3 years. this is what the consumers save. when the price of milk goes down. the consumers buy more. a recent study at purdue indicated that a 10percent decrease in the price of milk will increase consumption by 17 percent. that is what we all want. we want americans drinking milk. it is good for them. this amendment is straightforward and the case i believe for it is compelling. i hope my colleagues will jump at this chance to show we are serious  only about reducing our appalling budget deficit but about setting our agrliture policy on a more reasonable course. the committee. as i mentioned. has charted a. course but is  going to embark on it for more than a year and i think we can do better. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
. too often these days we hear the sentiment that america has more to lose to foreign trade than we have to gain from it. the cries for restrictions on imports assume that less trade means a better ecoic future for american industries and more jobs for our workers. hing could be further from the truth. our goal must be to generate higher levels of ecoic growth worldwide lowerso that american firms can export more. european and developing countries can better absorb our products into their markets. and third world debtors can repay their debts. e of this will come about if we contract world trade in an effort to achieve perfectly balanced trade statistics. there is question that our huge trade deficit is alarming on several accounts. in terms of trade policy. the deficit is leading to an erosion of u.s. support for open market policies. for a number of manufacturing industries. including textiles and steel. rising imports have meant a sluggish recovery from the recession rpsulting in only modest improvements in employment and profits in those industries. despite the ecoic recovery the nation has been experiencing. each of us in the senate is under pressure to solve these ecoic problems with instant gratificationprotectionism. the real solutions. though  politically attractive. are to reduce the domestic budget deficits and initiate measures aimed at greater savings in this country. aside from the attempt we are  making to balance the budget. we must also have a realistic. aggressive. reliable national trade policy. the trade enhancement act of 1985. *which i join in introducing today. is a comprehensive. bipartisan policy statement and plan of action. my reasons for  cosponsoring one of the bills titles are explained below.
 are unable to make hard choices. one of these choices may be to increase revenues. i believe it is imperative that we do everything possible to reduce spending before considering new taxes. but it will be irresponsible for us to exclude new revenues from discussion. such alternatives as a minimum corporate tax or a reduction in tax preferences would  only produce revenue to help cut the deficit. but would help to assure that the burden of deficit reduction is spread more evenly. the grammrudmanhollings plan is far from ideal. but the deficit crisis is an extraordinary situation. with deeply troubling consequences for our ecoy. it requires an extraordinary solution. this amendmentalthough far from perfectoffers us a solution. and i believe it would be irresponsible for us to ige it today. it has been said that the grammrudmanhollings plan means the end of the congressional budget process as we k it. this isa process which. though  perfect. does enable congress to assign budgetary priorities and. through reconciliation. achieve responsible savings in federal programs. it is my hope that the passage of the grammrudmanhollings amendment will instead strengthen the existing process. resulting in greater willingness to bring federal spending under control with the tools we already possess. the grammrudmanhollings plan thus poses to us an emous challenge: to pass a budget which imposes the burden of deficit reduction as fairly and swiftly as possible. it is also an opportunityto bring down the deficits and to assure that prosperous times will continue. this remains an opportunity we can afford to lose.
. you k. democracy is a pretty precious thing and the debate in this body is a pretty precious thing. i have talked with some on the other side when they have talked about debating motions to proceed and filibustering. and the answer is the rules permit it. all they are doing is acting under the rules. ladies and gentlemen. if we feel that we can go to the ultimate of the rules in this body every time and that there is comity. as it were. feeling of getting on with the business. if we are going to debate everything. have a fillbuster on the motion to proceed and then have a filibuster on the actual motion itself. and then use up our 100 hours. that is all permitted. but is that the way to do the business of the u.s. government. i do  think so. in the great issues. this hardly ranks as one of the great issues that has come before this body. in all fairness. what happens with conrail is  going to determine the future of this nation. but in the great debates in the past. those who have been involved with them and they were greater giants than we are. and i am talking about senator russell. and i am talking about those people who preceded us here. when the debate was over. when the cloture motion had been invoked. they went to the vote. the decision had been made. and we have to get on with the business of the people of the united states of america. and so i think that is the important lesson. the senator from michigan thinks we are all wrong. the rest of us do  k what we are doing. seventy of ushere are the votes: 5637. 5134. 6132. 7027. 6927. 91 to 5. that was a motion to instruct the sergeant at arms. and i suppose we got a lot of people we mally would  get on that. even though there were five who did  quite understand this business. and 63 to 33. what do you have to do to get on with the business of the united states. were we going to spend this week. next week. ad infinitum. on this business. i do  think so. let us get on. we have other tough things and the senator from michigan is a member of the budget committee and the problems with that budget make this conrail business pale in importance. that is the big measure that we ought to be dealing with. and let us get on with- it. so. i want to say i categorically reject this business that we are all guilty of participating in some conspiracy over here or we are all guilty of falsehood or untruth or illegitimate bidding was partook here or that there was defrauding. these are all statements that the senator who previously spoke used. i would hope that if people have votes. they bring them up and let us vote on it and see if we can settle" this matter once and for all and go on to other matters. thank you very much. .
. when i first came to the senate. i did  realize that senator proxmire was speaking on this every day. but when i would be here in the chamber. i would hear him speak about this geide convention. and day after day. i thought: does he speak on this every day. then i made inquiries and it turned out. yes.  only does he speak on it every day. but he has spoken on it every day for quite a while. for quite a while. how long is that. he has spoken on it every day since january 11. 1967.  there are  many senators who have even been in this chamber since 1967. so when somebody talks about dogged determination. the essence of it is right here in the senior senator from wisconsin. i wish to join in the tribute to him and also to my distinguished senior colleague from rhode island. senator pell. the ranking member of the committee. and senator lugar and the miity leader. they all have been important. but it seems to me where the credit is due really today for bringing this forward and having us vote on it is our majority leader. others have tried in the past. but he has brought it out and we are on the verge of passing it. i hope hing goes wrong. so maybe we all better  say much any more. i think we all owe him a deep debt of gratitude in the passage of this particular piece of legislation.
. before the senate recessed on february 7. i joined in as a cosponsor of this concurrent resolution disapproving the administrations request for rescission of fiscal year 1986 funds appropriated for the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention [ojjdp]. this rescission is just as objectionable as the freeze of fiscal year 1986 funds which hils been in effect for 2 months . causing undue hardship on existcontribution to our nation. further. we must  disappoint the adolescents of rhode island and many other states who need these programs to help them toward more responsible citizenship and useful lives in our society.o
madam president. in any measure. of course. there is a sense of compromise. this does  have everything that every one of us wants in it. but i think the important part is we are on the verge of getting reconciliation more importantly. in the out years. so. for that reason i am supporting the reconciliation measure and doing everything i can to forestall amendments that might result in its possible veto by the president. madam president. i do believe that this is a good measure. it is  everything that every one of us wants. but it is a major step ahead and it is reconciliation. something we have been trying to get for a long time for this fiscal year. madam president. i suggest the absence of a quorum.

 to analyze these fine recommendations and to inform the congress of the administrations plans for their implementation. for the past two decades the united states has exhibited a declining ability to compete. our productivity growth has been dismaloutstripped by almost all our trading partners. we are still the worlds strongest ecoy. yet. the question we must answer is where we will be tomorrow. we can blame all our competitiveness problems on foreign trade and the dollar. the deterioration of our trade balance began more than a decade ago. when the dollar was widely thought to be weak. some suggest that the best way to preserve american jobs is for government to erect protectionist fences to limit foreign competition in the united states. i strongly disagree. a far better alternative to protectionism is a policy that encourages american workers and industries to rise up and meet the competitive challenge. our primary problem is  the surge of imports. which always rise with strong u.s. ecoic growth. its a lack of growth in american exports. we must examine the ways in which the government hampers competitiveness through unilateral impediments to growthtax laws. securities laws. and other policies laws which inhibit research and development into new techogies and inative areas. this is what we want to receive from the administrationits overall strategy for reinstating the competitiveness of american. industry. in order to increase jobs and exports.
. that there is still a lot of fat in the budget which we should eliminate. it is clear to me that the choice grammrudmanhollings is forcing us to make should include an affirmation of educations importance. the federal budget plays a vital role in supplementing the efforts of local communities. and fine institutions of higher learning. all over the country. i k that in my state. for example. the education for the handicapped program is helping people with special needs gain the same quality education as any other child. those who administer this program. and the teachers who work with these students. make effective use of every penny they receive. aher fine example of where this money will go is the trio program. for bright high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds. trio programs. such as upward bound. have been outstandingly successful in equipping thousands of young rhode islanders with the skills they need to get into college. and to do well once they are there. as a final example. i would point out that this amendment will assist federal library programs. which are included in the education budget. in addition to the important traditional services they provide to readers. our libraries are making a strong effort to fight illiteracy. which prevents millions of americans from leading full. selfsufficient lives. i believe that as we make our difficult budget choices. these are the kinds of programs we must view as critical. and worth fighting for. education is about helping people make it in life. the programs which would benefit from the andrewshollings amendment represent investments in peoplepeople who will one day determine the course of this nation. and whom we must  neglect. i am happy to vote for this amendment. and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
 stated he sought for tax reform: fairness. simplicity. and ecoic efficiency. . let us just briefly talk about fairness. that is the overall most important achievement of this legislation. we wanted to ensure. as the senator from new york senator moynihan. pointed out previously. that persons with the same ecoic income are paying the same level of tax. and that corporations were escaping paying tax if they are profitable. that certainly is  true under the existing code. major corporations that are profitable are paying tax. that is wrong. the same is true for individuals. many extremely wealthy individuals with massive incomes are paying tax at all. this is an outrage. it is an outrage to the american people. and rightfully so. . the goal of fairness is achieved in two ways. first. by the elimination of the special deductions. credits. and exemptions that are available for certain groups of taxpayers. it is  everybody that can get these special breaks. just those who are wealthy egh to be able to invest in these tax shelters. the second major component of fairness in the legislation is the minimum tax20 percent for everybody. corporations and individuals. so this bill achieves the goal of fairness. what about simplicity. true. we have made a substantial stride toward simplicity. i do  think any tax code is going to be completely simple. and people will point out that this bill is over 800 pages. i do  k exactly how many pages it is but it is long. nevertheless. when it is all said and done. it is going to be a simpler code than we have . it will have only two rates for individuals15 percent and 27 percent. i think probably the greatest step toward achieving simplicity is the elimination of the differential for individuals between capital gains and ordinary income. i think a third of the code. and certainly a third of the time of revenue agents. is devoted to trying to distinguish what is a capital gain. what is ordinary income. that differential has been eliminated. it is all treated the same. it is counted as ordinary income what about the final goal. we sought fairness. we sought simplicity. but what about ecoic efficiency. has that been served by the proposed lower rates. gone as we have said so many times are the socalled. incentives. the purpose of these incentives was that we in the finance committee. and we in the congress thought it would be better for such and such activity to take place. thus we tried to encourage this activity through the tax code. we tried to encourage this type of exploration. this type of solar power. this type of investment in research and development. or whatever it might be. we tried to use the tax code to achieve these investment goals. what we have done in this tax reform bill is to eliminate many of those incentives. and say to the people of america. you invest your money in the fashion that you think makes the most sense to you. we believe you have some brains out there. mr. american and mrs. american. you can make the correct decisions. we are  going to have what we call an industrial policy that is dictated by the tax code of the country. with tax reform. capital should flow naturally to its most productive use. the government will  be intervening in the marketplace through the tax code.  we keep some incentives. we have carefully debated those. and members of the finance committee thought these were worthwhile incentives to keep. some are for research and development. some for historic rehabilitation. and some for lowincome housing. but we have learned our lesson about the efficiency of trying to run the country through the tax code. we ended up in this bill encouraging investment in far fewer activities than in the past because we say what we did in the past was  ecoically efficient. the current tax code provisions have resulted in too many boxcars. too many barges on the mississippi river. and too many buildings in houston that eventually ended up empty. over the last 20 years we enacted dozens of tax incentives to encourage every activity from oil wells to windmills. it happened gradually. i think most of us felt when we put these in the tax code that really they did  cost any money. we did  look at it that way. we did  realize. or perhaps did  pay as much attention as we might have. to the loss to the treasury as a result of this special incentive. this deduction. or this credit. i took a look into the history of this. i think people might be interested in these statistics. in 1970. only 15 years ago. the government collected $2.88 for every dollar of tax incentives. in other words. in 1970. there were some tax incentives in the code. but for every dollar of those incentives there was $2.88 of revenue that the government obtained.  that has been reversed.  because we have so many of these incentives. the government collects 98 cents in tax for every dollar of these incentives on the other side. i believe that as we debate this tax reform bill we ought to take to heart the lessons learned in the finance committee. the engine that is driving this legislation is the lower rates. we can start putting back into the bill a variety of special tax breaks. or we will see ineviably the tax rates climb. i am sure people are going to come and say this is a marvelous provision. it is going to create so many jobs. and all we will have to do is kick up the corporate rate 1 percent. what is the difference between 33 and 34 percent. pretty soon along will come somebody else with a wonderfully attractive provision. and all we will do is increase the top rate for individuals from 27 to 28 percent. once we start down that slippery path. we will lose the momentum we currently have. others will rise. there are 100 senators here with 200 ideas or more for incentives. and we will just be back in the pickle we were in before this legislation came along. the bill is  perfect. there are clearly going to be changes if  on the floor here. then perhaps in conference. nevertheless. i hope we can keep the amendments to a minimum. and of course act responsibly to make sure that all amendments are revenue neutral. in other words. if you want to propose amendment which loses revenue. then you will have to get the money to pay for it. one of the items that has been discussed here a lot is the individual retirement accounts. i support those. i hope some way can be worked out to preserve the individual retirement account [ira]. but i personally will  vote for a restoration of the ira if that means increasing the tax rates. i will  vote for them if it endangers the passage of this legislation. i have an amendment myself on a separate subject. it does  cost any money. that deals with the environmental matter. the socalled barrier islands.
. i oppose the amendment. the senators from the states that do  have an income tax but have a high sales tax clearly have a problem. as has ably been put forth by the senator from washington and the senator from south dakota. at the same time. in the proposed solution of their problem. they raise additional problems for the rest of us. in other words. it is the system for paying for their solution that i find objectionable. why am i opposed to their approach. for two reasons. first. because it puts the federal government back into the position. through the tax code. of choosing what is goodthat is. deductibleand what is badthat is. deductible. that is the first reason. the second reason. for specific factors that apply to the state i represent. is that what they are doing is once again. through congress. via the tax code. making the selection of what is a good deduction and what is a bad deduction. and the interest being deductible. one of the reasons why we have this tax reform proposal before us tonight and one of the reasons why it has received such high acclaim  only in the finance committee but also. i believe. on the floor of the senate and throughout the nation. one of the reasons why it has come so far. is that the people longer wish the congress of the united states. through the tax code. to be choosing what is good and what is bad. one of the major thrusts for tax reform is to get it out of that business.
. i shall restrict my remarks to that feature of the amendment of the senator from maine that restores the differential between capital gains and ordinary income. i think it is important to remember that that differential between capital gains and ordinary income was eliminated in the committee bill. let us briefly review the bidding.. the committee bill was truly revolutionary in that it eliminated practically all sheltersthose devices whereby taxpayers receive special deductions that caused certain portions of their. income  to be taxed. further. the committee bill reduced the number of tax brackets from the current 14 to 215 percent and 27 percent. that is all. six million taxpayers would be eliminated from the tax rolls. 80 percent would be paying at 15 percent. the personal exemption for lower- and middleincome taxpayers would be $2.000. finally. and most significantly. the difference in the treatment between capital gains and ordinary income would be eliminated. the committee bill thus achieves all three goals we sought when we embarked on tax reform: simplicity. fairness. and ecoic efficiency. what do we mean by ecoic efficiency. we mean by ecoic efficiency that individuals and corporations will spend their money for what they believe are the most productive purposes enticed by some tax reasoning that lures them into investments that make little sense except for the tax savings incurred thereby and the sheltering of some income. i believe it is important to k that the committee bill is a total departure from the past socalled tax reform measuresand we have seen a host of them come through here in the past 10 or 15 yearswhich tinkered with the internal revenue code. they canceled this deduction and that deduction and they added this incentive and subtracted that incentive. and they adjusted this rate up and that rate down. and they juggled the capital gains rate and they changed the amount of the individual exemption. that is what the house bill does. the house bill does this tinkering. the house bill retains capital gains. the house bill has four brackets: 15 percent. 25 percent. 35 percent. and 38 percent for individuals. the house bill does  deal with the most egregious shelters. the house bill is tax revision.  tax reform. and that is exactly what the mitchell amendment does. it is tax revision.  tax reform. the amendment of the senator from maine increases the number of brackets by adding a third at 35 percent. the senator from maine spends a good deal of time discussing the fact that some of the very rich will receive a tax cut of $53.000. and that is true. some few will receive such a cut because they are currently paying at the top rate and -thus they are paying a great deal of taxes. indeed. to receive a tax cut of $53.000 under the committee bill. the taxpayer would have to be currently paying $1.127.000 in taxes. assuming the 4.7percent average cut for those over $200.000. furthermore. if the rich are receiving 10 percent of the total tax cut. as has been stated on the floor. then i think the proponents of this amendment should at least ackledge that the group that is receiving 16 percent of the total tax cut is currently paying 22 percent of all taxes. the important point i wish to makeis that under current law. because of the shelters and because of capital gains. 67 percent of the rich60 percent of those are  raying less than 20 percent of their income in taxes. in other words. although the top rate is 50 percent. they are  paying it. sixtyseven percent are paying less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. and 43 percent of the very rich43 percent of all those with incomes over $200.000are paying less than 20 percent of their income in taxes. between shelters and capital gains. they avoid taxes and they cruise along very happily at rates far below the maximum. which is 50 percent. . the committee amendment eliminates all that. but by restoring the differential between capital gains -and ordinary income. the senator from maine is leading us into that old quagmire from which we are trying to extricate ourselves. much of the artful dodging that  takes place under our code will once again be encouraged. deal after deal will be structured to be a capital gain. the 25percent bracket will be reserved for those who are igant of the bonanza labeled "capital gain." . one final point. our nation has. over the history since the internal revenue code came into effect in 1913. been blessed with a population that traditionally has paid its taxes. . it is secret that compliance with the internal revenue code has been slipping to a discouraging and alarming degree during the past 10 or 15 years. . why is this so. why have taxpayers longer been paying with a high compliance rate. obeying the law. filing their taxes properly. the way they used to. there are two reasons. i believe. first is the intense irritation by taxpayers against a code that permits some people to pay very little or tax while the ordingy citizen. usually because of withholding on his or her wages. must pay his or her fair share. so that is the first reason compliance has failed. because of these shelters. because of capit)l gains out there which permit the rich  to pay to the extent they ought to be paying. . the second factor that has caused slippage in comiliance is that the irs agents are abie  to audit less than 2 percent of al. returns. . why is this so. why are so fei returns being audited. so few returns are being audited because the agents time is consumed to a considerable extent in trying to d.termine whether a transaction by these wealthy taxpayers is a capital gain or is ordinary income. it is estimated by treasury officials that 20 to 30 percent of the time of the irs agents is devoted to this complex task of trying to figure out whether the taxpayer has capital gain or has ordinary income. thus. the fact that. in the committee bill. we have eliminated the differential between ordinary income and capital gains means the irs agents time will be freed up so therelore they can devote it to auditing more of the tax returns that are  fiied. there is question. when there is an increased percentage of audits. there is going to be greater compliance. i think it is a fact that if most taxpayers realize they are going to be audited or might be audited. it certainly increases the chanes for compliance. . the mitchell amendment retreats from all this by restoring the capital gains differential because the amendment of the senator from maine provides all the manipulations inherent with capital gains including providing aher form of shelter for the rich. thaft is what capital gains are. i do hope that this amendment is defeated.
so that got rejected. then there comes the other possibility. about the consumer interest rate. and you get so high on the rate you lose the purpose of the bill. maybe it is as the senator from michigan is suggesting. unfair. all i can say is i personally believe that the primary objective of achieving the lower rates is a worthwhile goal and. fortunately. we have achieved it here. i will finally point out that when you are at the 15 percent tax rate. the value of the deductibility of the interest is greatly increased. if that is any solace.
$68 billion. . that money is coming from u.s. corporations. and it is coming from u.s. corporations that are able to remain competitive in the united states and in the world market because they have some international operations. this will affect all the companies that do some business abroad. some manufacturing abroad. even for parts that are integral to the unit that they produce in the united states and assemble in the united states. so it applies to the ibms. it applies to the fords. it applies to the cross pen co.. from my state that has a unit in ireland. what i think is terribly important to remember at this point. . the overseas taxes that are paid by the u.s. corporations can only receive a credit against their u.s. taxes on the same basis as their u.s. taxes would have been. in other words. if the country overseas levies a 70percent tax rate. those total dollars paid can be brought back as a credit against u.s. taxes. the taxes can only be a credit at the same rate that the u.s. company is paying taxes in the united states. 46 percent or 40 percent or whatever it might be.
. i k there is some opposition to this. and i am prepared to hear that opposition. in 1983. probably the finest step forward in the environmental field that we took was the protection of these valuable islands. which are important to the wildlife. to the ecology. to the bird life. and to human life. as a protection along our shores. they have been devastated in many instances. onethird of them are gone. but thank goodness. the u.s. congress saw fit to act in 1983 to protect those areas as best we could. if we had the money. we would buy them. but unfortunately we do  have the money. so we have taken the federal government out of the business of subsidizing the development. this is aher step in taking the federal government out of the business of subsidizing it through the tax code.
. the senator from th carolina said that we are changing the rules in the middle of the game. i would stress that under the amendment i have presented it is prospective. in other words. it does  apply to somebody who has a house there . if you have a house there  and the house is washed away. on a barrier island or a beach. you are entitled to a deduction as a loss on your income tax statement. so it goes for a developer. if his building is there already. he can take accelerated depreciation. it is prospective. etheless. i recognize the situation here. i k that the senators from south carolina and th carolina both have supported this effort when we formed those barrier islands and beaches. i remember an excellent speech that the senator from south carolina gave when we passed that barrier islands land legislation. i also remember the distinguished senior senator had objections and indeed might have been a cosponsor by the time we finished. i can recall. but. in any event. he certainly did  object. in that spirit. and recognizing that e of us want to hold up this tax bill and we want to achieve the goal. which is passage. at least in this instance. passage of the protection for these islands in the future through the tax code sections that i delineated. i would be willing to withdraw my amendment. i hope that both senators and those other senators that they mentioned would cooperate in trying to find a solution to this matter. we have a serious problem. it is true that we have given a good deal of protection through the steps we have taken. but these islands are important to the whole nation.  after all. i come from a state that has them. so i have as deep a concern as anybody. as the senator from th carolina has. likewise.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on finance be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on thursday. june 19. to conduct a hearing on the ination of lawrence gibbs to be commissioner of the internal revenue service.
 the tax bill contains a set of provisions designed to govern the taxation of socalled multipleclass mortgagebacked securities. the purpose of the provisions was to facilitate the secondary mortgage market. the provisions were originally introduced by me. and cosponsored by senator bentsen. in s. 1959. however. due to revenue considerations. the provisions as reported by the finance committee are identical to those in s. 1959. rather. the provisions as reported by committee have been sharply criticized in the industry. one of the main things that has alarmed the industry. i believe. is that the provisions in the bill prohibit the use of vehicles utilized under current law for issuing multipleclass mortgagebacked securities. i would hope that in the conference this could be changed to allow a phaseout of these vehicles over perhaps 5 years. it is my understanding that the treasury department indicated its support for some type of phaseout in testimony before the house ways and means committee on june 10. 1986. it is also my understanding that the treasury department in the same testimony suggested other changes in these provisions that would make them more workable. and i would like to pursue those suggestions as well in the conference.
. i want to bring to the attention of my distinguished colleagues a provision in the current bill which i believe is unfair. the bill eliminates cash or deferred arrangements for state and local government employees. these arrangements. also kn as 401(k) plans. allow employees to defei receipt of cash compensation and have this amount contributed to a qualified plan. under a 401(k) plan an employee is  taxed on the contribution until it is actually distributed from the plan. the current bill would eliminate 401(k) benefits for state and local government employees but retain them for the private sector and profit organizations. the recently enacted federal employee retirement system act of 1986 provides federal employees with benefits similar to those of 401(k). therefore. if this bill is enacted. every employee in this country will be able to benefit from section 401(k) except for those employed by state and local governments. there is logical explanation for the exclusion of state and local government employees from 401(k) benefits. it is unjust to discriminate against this one group. if we decide that it is a desirable policy to provide tax favored savings to employees. then i believe all employees should be able to share in the benefit equally. it is inconsistent with the goal of fairness and tax reform to provide a tax subsidy to one group of employees and to deny it to aher without justification. moreover. denying public employees 401(k) benefits it makes it far more difficult for a state or local government to attract and retain quality employees. we must  subsidize the private sector at the expense of public employers and their employees. state and local governments should be able to continue to offer 401(k) benefits to their employees. it is wrong to single them out for discrimination. i hope all my colleagues will join with me in urging the conference committee to reinstitute 401(k) benefits for public employees.
gore. humphrey. baucus. and dixon of 5 minutes each. we have routine morning business  to extend beyond 11:30 a.m.. and then at 11:30 a.m.. hopefully we will be back on s. 2638. the dod authorization bill. pending is the dole amendment 2417 in the second degree to the byrd amendment 2414. i assume by then maybe we could agree to set those amendments aside if it is all right with the miity leader and the managers could go on with whatever they had in mind. at 1 p.m.. it will be the intention of the majority leader to receive the articles of impeachment on judge clalborne from the managers on the part of the house of representatives. we have  quite worked out the second and third stages of that but we have agreed that at 1 oclock we will accept the message. and they will be here with the articles. also. it would be my intention. if there is a vote on the textile bill. if the presidents veto is overridden in the house of representatives. that we would take action on that today. i think that is the will of the principals. i have  yet had a chance to visit with the distinguished senator from south carolina. senator hollings. but i have visited with senator thurmond from south carolina. and others. it is my hope that we can reach some agreement on the two big issues that have been sort of hanging up everything around here the past couple of weeks. and that is south africa and contra aid. we had a caucus last evening. the republicans. with 41 members attending. i think it is fair to characterize that meeting as a willingness to proceed with these two issues. even some who are strongly opposed to south africa. i think would be willing to proceed if there could be some agreement on the contra vote. and some who are opposed to the contra vote would be willing to vote for cloture on the contra bill itself on the basis that we had it before the senate before. we passed it. and we should have the opportunity to vote on it again. so it seems to me that. on our side of the aisle. we at least have the seeds of potential agreement on these two highly controversial issues. i will be giving the distinguished miity leader the results of our meeting and see if we can work out some agreement. i certainly want to reiterate and underscore the comments of senator domenici last night with reference to the debt ceiling and the necessity of going to conference. hopefully today. if we could work out some agreement and release the debt ceiling from the contra and south africa controversy. then they could start the conference on the debt ceiling as soon as they could. because there are some major issues. in addition to all the christmas tree ornaments that were hung on the debt ceiling. there are some amendments that i assume will be seriously considered in the conference. one being the modification of grammrudmanhollings. that is aher reason i think it is incumbent that we try to reach some agreement on south africa and the contra aid problem. but. having said that. there is a 2 oclock vote scheduled on the cloture motion relating to s. 2638. again. there is a possibility that may be withdrawn or postponed if we can either reach an agreement or indicate that we are serious about reaching an agreement.
. however. i e that the housepassed continuing resolution includes $2.4 billion for fiscal year 1987 but does  release the remaining $600 million in fiscal year 1986 funds. the house bill also fences the money until such time as the authorizing committees complete action on the clean water act and subsequent appropriations are made. as i indicated. we are making good progress on the clean water conference. but i fear that action on the continuing resolution may be completed prior to completion of a clean water conference report. if that is the case. under the house bill. funds will be unavailable to the state due to the fencing provision. i would ask the distinguished floor manager to make every effort in conference to accept the house provision which includes $2.4 billion in fiscal year 1987 and keep the $600 million in fiscal year 1986 funds. but to oppose fencing the entire amount of money.
. h.r. 4531 extends the wetlands loan act through fiscal year 1988. allows for additional appropriations to complete acquisition of atchafalaya national wildlife refuge. la: and clarifies the language of the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act relative to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985. extension of the wetlands loan act under section 1 of the bill is a pressing national priority. we passed the wetlands loan act in 1961 to accelerate federal acquisition of migratory waterfowl habitat. this law. as amended. authorizes the appropriation of $200 million as a loan against future revenues from the sale of duck stamps. at the present cost of $7.50 per stamp. revenues are approximately $14.4 million per year. however. the acts authorization. of which about $190 million has been appropriated. expired on september 30. 1986. and. beginning october 1. 1986. 75 percent of the revenues raised from the sale of duck stamps must be used to repay the loan. only about $3.5 million would then remain available on an annual basis to purchase the necessary wetlands. this bill. h.r. 4531. therefore. is urgently needed in order to avoid a near shutdown of the nations wetlands acquisition efforts. using duck stamp funds and funds advanced against future stamp sales under the wetlands loan act. the fish and wildlife service purchased in fee title or easement approximately 1.9 million acres toward their goal from 1959 to 1977. acquisition of aher 1.9 million wetland acres for conservation of migratory birds was to be completed during the 10year period between fiscal year 1977 and fiscal year 1986. over the past decade. however. the fish and wildlife service will have acquired less than 25 percent of the 1.9 million acres of waterfowl habitat identified for federal acquisition. similarly the states have acquired only about 20 percent of the 2.5 million acres identified for state acquisition. clearly. we need to do a better job of meeting our goals. in may 1986 the united states and canada signed the "th american waterfowl management plan." which describes the actions and size of the task  believed necessary to achieve waterfowl population levels that will satisfy current public demand. the plan calls for the acquisition. protection. or improvement of approximately 1.9 million acres in the united states and 3.7 million acres in canada. the total cost for habitat protection in the united states identified by the plan approaches $500 million. the required waterfowl habitat protection and improvement in canada may reach $1 billion. the cost of providing this habitat protection will have to be shared by governmental and governmental entities in the united states and canada. section 1 of h.r. 4531 at least will allow 100 percent of the duck stamp receiptsapproximately $14 millionto continue to be used toward achievement of the goals of the plan. section 2 of h.r. 4531 makes technical changes in public law 98458. which authorized establishment of the atchafalaya national wildlife refuge. to facilitate acquisition of the refuge. the changes.allow the fish and wildlife service to alter the proposed boundaries of the refuge to incorporate those habitat areas that have been made available for acquisition and to use all funds provided under appropriations acts for acquisition of the refuge for that purpose. the atchafalaya national wildlife refuge legislation authorized the secretary of the interior to designate. with the concurrence of the state of louisiana. lands and waters considered appropriate for a national wildlife refuge within the atchafalaya basin. the lands were to be purchased with funds provided under public law 98396. a supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1984. since enactment of the refuge authorization legislation. the u.s. fish and wildlife service has been negotiating with landowners in the atchafalaya basin. the service recently reached an agreement with a large landholding company which would provide for the acquisition of over 15.000 acres of wildlife habitat within the basin for approximately $12.4 million. because some of the acreage to be purchased under this agreement falls outside the original area designated for acquisition and because additional funds are required to purchase the acreage. the legislation before us today is needed to clarify and facilitate establishment of the refuge. finally. section 3 of h.r. 4531 addresses potential technical problems relating to the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp act. which were raised by passage of grammrudmanhollings. the technical change made by this bill in the migratory bird hunting and conservation ("duck") stamp act specifies that the u.s. fish and wildlife service is required to obligate only those duck stamp fund receipts which are available and that failure to obligate funds sequestered under grammrudmanhollings does  require reduction in the price of the stamp. under current law. 100 percent of the duck stamp receipts and wetland loan act appropriations from a given year must be obligated by february 1 of the following year. otherwise. the price of the duck stamp reverts to $5 from its current price of $7.50. the fear is that the sequestration of some funds in the migratory bird conservation fund under the grammrudmanhollings law could be characterized as a failure to obligate all available funds for that year and thereby require a reduction in the price of the stamp. consequently. section 3 of h.r. 4531 clarifies the language of the duck stamp act to leave doubt that the fish and wildlife service is required to obligate only those funds which are available and that failure to obligate sequestered funds does  require such a price reduction. funds in the migratory bird conservation fund which are sequestered in any given fiscal year become available. in any case. for obligation in subsequent fiscal years.
i thank my distinguished friend and colleague. the senator from maine. for those generous comments. throughout the work on this measure. working with senator mtchell has been  only an intellectual pleasure but also a great personal pleasure. he is a man who ks the act. is truly dedicated to improving the quality of the waters of our nation. at every step of the way. he was helpful and constructive. this act. -in which he generously said i had a major hand. was the result of com.bined efforts. and his part in it .was very significant. i also thank the senior senator from texas . who was helpful overall in this project. of course. our distinguished chairman of the committee. senator stafford. has made this a truly bipartisan matter. i thank the staffs as well. so it has been a thorough pleasure dealing with this matter. which has gone on for a long time. we passed the bill in the senate over a year ago. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a chart showing the fiscal years and funding levels.
i thank the senator from th dakota for making this point. the conferees recognized that many tribal governments. unlike state governments. do  yet have a regulatory program base. an underlying financial and budgetary foundation or a supporting tax infrastructure which could be used in costsharing on these programs. furthermore. funding assistance priorities should be established according to the severity of the problems identified in the epa survey.
 to sign house of representatives in the conthe measure. ference that we held at that time so here we are. the bill is exactly which i had the privilege to be chairthe same as was passed in the confer- man of. ence. it has already passed the house. in exchange for tightening up the is  in the senate. and will soon be program and reducing the authorizapassed here. tion. the administration

but it is a small sum compared mitchell touched upon. point to the more than -$75 billion that it is sources. as he said. is rain which washes off from city streets. or flows off of agricultural fields and is contaminated with pesticides and insecticides. it is different from point sources. such as a discharge from a municipality or a factory. and. as i mentioned. h.r. 1 continues funding of waste water treatment works at the $2.4 billion level annually through fiscal 1991. thereafter. it gets into the establishments of a revolving fund to ease the transition to full state and local sufficiency. i would like to take a few moments to touch on some of the key provisions of the bill. for a more complete explanation. i ask my colleagues to refer to last years debate when we had this program come up. and the conference report accompanying s. 1128. which was the number of the bill last year. the legislation strengthens several regulatory programs. one such program relates to conventional pollutants. under current law. modifications can be sought from strong discharge requirements for socalled conventional pollutants. many of which. as senator burdick mentioned before. are highly toxic. in an effort to severely limit the circumstances in which these weaker modifications can be given. the conference report allows these modifications only for five specific pollutants. if other pollutants are to be listed for modification. epa has to go through a special procedure. this procedure requires the administrator to first determine whether a pollutant meets the criteria of toxic pollutant. if it does. then the pollutant must be listed as toxic from which variance can be received. if the pollutant is  found to be toxic. the administrator must then determine whether it can be listed under section 301(g) as a conventional pollutant. if it meets that test. the administrator must finally determine whether an applicant applying for a modification from the effluent guideline for that particular pollutant can meet the test contained in section 301(g). it is expected that each of these steps be conducted through the formal regulatory process. it is also important to e that a stay of requirements for control of pollutants other than the conventional pollutant for which the modification is being sought is prohibited. the legislation also contains provisions which severely limits the opportunities for which discharges can get modifications for fundamentally different factors. a key provision under the fundamentally different factors section specifically excludes consideration of costs. independent of other eligible factors. as a basis for establishing a fundamental difference with regard to an individual facility. section 304 of the clean water act authorizes the epa to consider the cost of achieving effluent reductions. in addition to other factors. in development of a guideline. for an entire industry. the epa needs to consider cost when developing a guideline for an industry in order to determine the best available techogy for water pollution control which is ecoically achievable for an entire industry. while a guideline is intended to account for ecoic impact on an entire industry. it is  intended to account for the ecoic impact on each individual facility. the 1972 clean water act conference report stressed this point.. directing epa to make the determination of the ecoic impact of an effluent limitation on the basis of classes and categories of point sources. as distinguished from a plantbyplant determination. if a facility facing higher costs than the overall industry is allowed to reduce costs then the overall industry is allowed to reduce treatment levels below the minimum level. the degree of pollution control at a facility is linked to the ecoic efficiency of the facility. rather than the ecoic ability of the industry. and the principle of an industrywide minimum level of treatment loses its meaning. although the act does  and should  provide a mechanism to modify the requirements of an effluent guideline on the basis of fundamentally different costs at an individual facility. section 301(c) of the act provides for modification of requirements in a case where such requirements are beyond the ecoic capability of the owner. section 301(c) does  allow the administrator to modify treatment requirements based on a showing of fundamentally different costs to an individual facility. unless these costs are beyond the ecoic capability of the facility and. therefore. threaten its survival. in addition. section 301(c) is subject to section 301(1l). which prohibits the administrator from modifying any requirement as it applies to a toxic pollutant. this provision assures that toxic pollutants will be controlled. regardless of the ecoic capability of the discharger. the new authority for treatment modifications based on fundamentally different factors contained in the bill is  subject to section 301(1). section 301(n)(6) provides that an application for an alternative requirement under this section shall  stay the facilitys obligation to comply with the effluent limitation guideline or standard which is the subject of the application. this provision is intended to prevent epa or the state. or the potw in the case of indirect discharge. from delaying issuance of the permit or pretreatment mechanism during the pendency of an application. the owner or operator of a facility seeking an fdf modification has the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the administrator that the facility is eligible for an alternative requirement under this section. the administrators decision to promulgate or deny an alternative effluent limitation or standard under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review pursuant. to section 509(b)(1) of the act. the administrator may  delegate the authority provided by this subsection to any state. in addition. the authority of this section should be exercised only by the administrator or assistant administrator for water. rather than regional or other officials. the administrator shall obtain the concurrence of a state before approving any alternative requirements under this subsection. the bill also contains provisions continuing the chesapeake bay program. it establishes a great lakes water quality program and sets up a new national estuary program which provides that management conferences develop control strategies to assist in the clean up of estuaries. this is especially important to the narragansett bay in my state of rhode island which suffers from degradation of water quality. before i finish about the chesapeake bay. we are making great progress in that bay. we have had extraordinary cooperation from the states involvedmaryland. virginia. and pennsylvania. it is just an example of what can be done with some federal input. funds in this bill are also set aside for correction of combined sewer overflows which can cause serious pollution in our states more precious natural resource. the narragansett bay. and other estuaries around the nation. as senator mitchell pointed out. a new point source control program is included in the legislation. the program would authorize $400 million over 4 years for states to develop comprehensive programs to abate such pollution ruf from urban areas and from farmlands which are often contaminated with toxic and other pollut. ants. i might say this is a major step forward. people have discussed point pollution for a long time. but we have  gotten into it for a variety of reasons. one of them is the fear of local communities and the states that for some reason we might be getting into zoning control in those areas. how are you going to keep a field from draining off into a stream. how are you going to control that. is the federal government stepping in to say to a farmer he can do this or do that. so we are moving cautiously with $400 million over 4 years for the states to develop the programs.  the federal government. but the states. this legislation also beefs up the enforcement provisions of the act by increasing penalties for civil and criminal violations. it adds a new authority for the administrator to assess administrative penalties against unpermitted discharges. the administrator can do that. assess the penalties on violators. epa has new authority to assess penalties against the unpermitted discharges. i expect epa to use this authority aggressively against illegal pol. luters. even if a memorandum of agreement is  concluded with the secretary of the army. the corps enforcement recordand the corps of engineers is involved in thisshows the corps has  been vigorous egh against illegal dumpers.  we have given epa the authority to move against these polluters. new paragraph 309(g)(6) sets out limitations that preclude citizen suits where the federal government or a state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an administrative civil penalty action or has already issued a finaladministrative civil penalty order  subject to further review and the violator has paid the penalty. the same provision limits federal civil penalty actions under subsections 309(d)and 311(b) for any violation of the federal water pollution control act. while redundant enforcement activity is to be avoided and state action to remedy a violation of federal law is to be encouraged. the limitation on federal civil penalty actions clearly applies only in cases where the state in question has been authorized under section 402 to implement the relevant permit.program. a single discharge may be a violation of both state and federal law and a state is entitled to enforce its own law. however. only if a state has received authorization under section 402 to implement a particular permitting program can it prosecute a violation of federal law. thus. even if. a authorized state takes action under state law against a person who is responsible for a discharge which also constitutes a violation of the federal permit. the state action can be addressed to the federal violation. for the state has authority over the federal permit limitation or condition in question. in such case. the authority to seek civil penalties for violation of the federal law under subsections 309(d) or 311(b) or section 505 would be unaffected by the state action. withstanding paragraph 309(g)(6). in addition. the limitation of 309(g)(6) applies only where a state is proceeding under a state law that is comparable to section 309(g). for example. in order to be comparable. a state law must provide for a right to a hearing and for public ice and participation procedures similar to those set forth in section 309(g). it must include analogous penalty assessment factors and judicial review standards. and it must include provisions that are analogous to the other elements of section 309(g). finally. section 309(g)(6)(a) provides that violations with respect to which a federal or state administrative penalty action is being diligently prosecuted or previously concluded "shall  be the subject of" civil penalty actions under sections 309(d). 311(b). or 505. this language is  intended to lead to the disruption of any federal judicial penalty action then underway. but merely indicates that a federal judicial civil penalty action or a citizen suit is  to be commenced if an administrative penalty proceeding is already underway.
ial commission on executive. legislative and judicial salaries. found that the gap between toplevel public salaries and those in the private sector has continued to widen. the commission concluded that federal executives. legislators. and members of the judiciary have experienced a decline of over 40 percent in real income since 1969. as long as federal salaries fail to compete with those in the private sector. we run the risk that the pool of talent for senior government officials will get smaller and smaller. i am deeply concerned about this trend. but there is an even greater risk that we are running when we talk about increasing federal salaries at this timethe risk that we will lose our credibility with the american people in our efforts to reduce the deficit. reducing the deficit remains our  1 domestic challenge. we must bring the deficit down in order to preserve our ecoic recovery. permit our businesses to compete and keep americans working. two years ago. with the deficit projected to reach $300 billion by 1991. congress took the extraordinary step of approving binding legislation to bring spending under controlthe bipartisan grammrudmanhollings act the deficit. which reached $220 billion in fiscal year 1986. is projected to be $174 billion in the current fiscal year and $169 billion in fiscal year 1988. although this is good news. the deficit remains alarmingly high. in order to comply with the deficit reduction targets of the grammrudman law. savings on the order of $60 billion will be needed. reducing the deficit has entailed some very difficult choices in this body during the past several years. in many cases congress has reduced spending for a number of federal programs in order to make budgetary savings. less money is being spent on public works programs such as highways and ecoic development. assistance to american cities through general revenue sharing has been halted. in some cases. priority programs such as education. nutrition. and health care have barely kept pace with inflation. congress has made reduction of the deficit a national. priority and has called upon each american to help bear the burden. for example. last year. federal retirees were called upon to forgo their annual costofliving adjustment in order to help reduce the deficit. families applying for student loans and veterans seeking medical care are being made subject to a means test before they can qualify. more difficult choices lie before us: where and how to reduce spending. and if and when to increase revenues. whatever steps we take will have important consequences for millions of americans. i believe the american people will take our efforts seriously as long as we remain committed to the principle of fairnessthat everyone has a stake in reducing the deficit. i do  believe we can permit these pay raises to occur at a time when every segment of the federal budget is under scrutiny in the search for savings. if the need for austerity requires further cuts or increased taxes in the budget for the next fiscal year. the american people will be justified in asking how we in congress could grant a pay raise for ourselves and for other federal executives. in setting national priorities. we have told the american people that reducing the deficit should come first. by permitting these raises january 29. 1987 cold we would be saying that we come first and the deficit comes second. the overwhelming majority of american taxpayers who would foot the bill for these pay raises make here near as much money as their senator or congressman or the federal officials covered by the pay increase. they are still waiting for us to act effectively to bring the federal budget closer to balance. until we do. pay raise can be justified. if we forgo the raises at this time. and maintain the confidence of the american people in the battle to balance the budget. the result will be lower deficits and a stronger ecoy. if we succeed in this endeavor. the pay raise will have been worth waiting for.
 to provide intellectual property protection technical assistance as part of foreign aid. this trade bill will  be the instant solution to our current trade deficit or the even larger issue of u.s. competitiveness. but it.is a concrete. beginning response. it is  a simplistic protectionist response. other than a section on agriculture. there are provisions which simply deal with one sector of the ecoysteel. autos. and so forth. this bill also avoids the protectionist provisions contained in last years housepassed trade bill. this bill is a responsible and promising proposal which i look forward to making even better as the process moves along.
. i fer. taxes. budget policy. trade policy. think the amendment that the distin- capital markets and worker retraining. guished senator from washington has many of the members of the caucus provided is an excellent one. the advi- worked hard to ensure that these prosory capacity of the competitiveness visions were included in the senate aspects can still be heard. but without trade bill. by any measure. they have all the drawbacks that i think exist been successful. some of our recomunder the existing language. for those mendations. such as those dealing reasons. i do support the amendment. with tax policy. are  included in the i thank the chair. trade bill. it is our hope that some of
s right to consider the ecoic best interests of the country and of the consumers when he deals with the 201 provisions. namely fair imports into the united states. he can consider the interests of the consumers in preventing retaliation against those quotas. levies. tariffs. whatever they might be. against those fair imports. . what about some of the favored industries. we have a long list of favored industries: sugar. lamb. tobacco. fence panels- on it goes. these are protectionist measures that have place in this bill. also. i regret they have even injected foreign policy into this. we have repealed the mostfavorednation status of romania. that does  belong in this bill any more than the attempt to legislate tax policy. such as the repeal of the windfall profits tax. that is in this bill. that should be in the tax bill. of course. the mandatory ification for plant closings. that has hing to do with trade policy. why it is here. ody ks. these provisions detract from the important purposes of the trade bill. we should be sending a strong message in this bill that the united states supports an open trading system in the world and that is what we have stood for ever since world war ii. and that we are prepared to get tough on unfair trade practices. we are sending that message in some parts of the bill. in other parts. we have got our own special interests. we are going to take care of lamb. we are going to take care of sugar. we are going to take care of these little sectors. specific sectors. that denigrate the principles of fair and open trade. i will vote in favor of this bill but do so without great enthusiasm. with the high hope that it will be substantially improved in the conference with the house of representatives. i thank the chair. several senators addressed the chair.
. i ask unanimous consent that secretary bakers letter. several newspaper articles describing the debt for nature swaps. and the text of the bill be printed in the record immediately following this statement.
i want to thankmy colleagues very much for those kind comments. again. i want to repeat that i want to pay tribute to them for what they did -in those negotiations with dr. bowen and mr. wright from the budget office. it was an arduous process and every single one of themand i k that senator daschle is  here. but he was a key player.here also. i do want to thank senator mitchell. who. as i say. was our leader in all of this. plus. senator durenberger and senator heinz
i would like to make a correction in what the senior senator from arkansas said. they do  have to pay their back taxes off unless it is sold off to aher entity. the senator from arkansas is mistaken. this is one whale of a break in what they are getting under this program. what we said last year to our constituents who had $5 million in revenues was we forced them to switch to the cash method of accounting and to pay their deferred taxes over 4 years. this amendment takes a step in rectifying what will remain an inequity. the farmers still get a tremendous break. we are  putting them on the same scale as everybody else.  by a long shot. even after this amendment. family farms over $5 million but less than $50 million will still be using the cash method of accounting. even after our amendment. family farms with incomes over $50 million will have  4 years but 10 years to pay their taxes on their deferred income. absent this being approved. the suspension remains in there and they never pay taxes on their past income unless they sell the business.
. my purpose here is to try to cause parliamentary. problems or any other difficulty for this. deficit reduction exercise: it. is. of. utmost importance that we pass this. bill. and i especially want to commend. senator bentse for his effective leadership in. fulfilling the finance committees obligations under. terms of the budget. summit agreement. i would like to. inquire of the chairman.. however. if he would consider a strategy in conference where he might be willing.to drop the pica. tax.on tips provision. if. other revenue increases.. possibly from the house package. can be adopted in its place.
. it is important that the leadership amendment be approved in order to avoid the triggering of acrosstheboard cuts under the grammrudman law. automatic cuts could result in sharp reductions in a number of important areas of the budget. in addition. the triggering of such cuts would signify the failure of this nations leaders to thoughtfully shape a blueprint for federal spending. there is such blueprint which could please all the members to this body. but the leadership package provided us with a framework both for cutting the deficit and protecting priority programs. for that reason i vote for its adoption and am pleased it was approved.
. on behalf of all of us. i thank senator nicxles for the outstanding work that he has done in the whole matter of all our national indebtedness. but particularly drawing attention to the problems raised by the envisioned social security surplus and what is actually happening. i think he has performed a great service and i think we owe him a debt of thanks..
is it correct to say that the budget committee agrees that the $1.5 billion proposed by the president for the sewage treatment construction grant and loan program in fiscal year 1989 is inadequate and that the presidents request for the natural resources function is generally insufficient.
s veto is  overridden. i hope that we could go immediately to work on a new bill and that the democratic leadership would work diligently during the remainder of this session for a new trade bill. without those provisions the ad. mini:stration finds objectionable. is it possible to do this. of course. it is possible. everybody ks the issue. we have been around this track time and time again. there is hing new in this bill. we have dealt with it for over 2 years. within a couple of weeks. we could easily come back. if the agreement is there on behalf of the democratic leadership. with a new piece of legislation that is suitable to the administration. i think we will be making a mistake if we think that this trade legislation or any other trade legislation is the salvation of the problems of the u.s. trade position. it. is . in testimony before the finance committee. we had evidence that the trade deficit of the united states is only 15 percent or perhaps 20 percent attributable to the unfair trading practices of our trading partners. in other words. we are getting outgunned.  because of unfair trade practices but because of better products in some instances. lower costs. more inative practices. better designs. we have to work on that side of the equation. and we arc. and it is encouraging to see our trade deficit come down as it is. so i would hope everybody would bear that in mind. certainly. we want the best trade bill we can get. and we can get it if we have this or a similar version later on. but let us all bear in mind that all of the problems of the trade difficulties of the united states are  going to be solved on the floor of this congress by a long shot. so i would hope that we would get a trade bill. if  this one. one similar to it if the veto should be sustained. i thank the.chair.
. i am pleased to join in the introduction of legislation. that is very important to the continued improvement of american competitiveness in research and experimental activities. we originally enacted the research and experimental tax credit in 1981 to provide an incentive for american taxpayers to spend more money on research and experimental activities. this incentive has been incredibly successful. since the enactment of the credit. private research and experimental expenditures in the united states have reached record levels. unfortunately. the current structure of the credit does  provide an incentive for american companies to maintain this level of expenditures. at hearings held last year by the subcommittee on taxation and debt management of the finance committee. we heard several witnesses. including the treasury department and several ecoists and academics. who testified that we should restructure the base period in order to improve the credits incentive value. under the current structure. a taxpayer must continue to increase the amount of research and experimental expenditures each year. since the credit is computed on the excess expenditures over a base period amount. this base period amount is computed utilizing the research and experimental expenditures for the prior 3 years. this computation causes the base period amount to increase as taxpayers continue to increase research and experimental expenditures. i believe that this structure may provide an incentive for certain companies to reduce research and experimental expenditures for several years. in order to qualify for the credit in later years. the structure proposed in our bill would establish a primary base period amount that will encourage american businesses to increase their research and experimental expenditures over the base period levels and to maintain those levels. however. this base period amount  be fixed. but would increase as our inal gross national produci. increases from year to year. these provisions require research and experimental expenditures to be increased by an amount that exceeds the percentage increase in inal gross national product. i believe it is vitally important that we provide this incentive to american businesses to increase and maintain higher levels of research and cxperi. mental expenditures. we need this additional research to regain the competitive edge that we have enjoyed for years. but which we have lost to other nations such as japan. in addition. this legislation will extend the eligibility for the credit to startup companies and new lines of business within existing companies. und(:r the cuirent structure. these startup businesses would  have receiv(:d the benefits of the credit for their research and experimental expenditures. we are  providing a much needed incentive for the creatton of new businesses with the purpose of performing research and experinentation. rinally. this act would make the credit permanent and thus remove the uncertainty surrounding it. we need to assure the american businesses that undertake research activities that the credit will be available permanently. since many research activities will span several years and could e:.ceed any temporary ex tensions. i urge my colleagues to support this measure that )a vitally important to american competitiveness. 9 by mr. 730schwitz (for himself. m. dole. mr. heinz. mr. durewberger. mr. bond. and mr. mccain):
madam president. the technical corrections act of 1988 is vitally important to the american taxpayer. in order to provide the taxpaying citizens of this country with the guidance necessary accurately to comply with tax reform. i believe we must enact these technical corrections before the end of the 100th congress. american taxpayers have already been required to file tax returns tinder the law enacted in tax reform. and in many cases these laws contain technical drafting errors. the goal of this bill is to correct clerical and drafting errors and to resolve dozens of ambiguities in the tax reform act of 1986 and the budget reconciliation act of 1987. in addition. this bill provides the guidance necessary to taxpayers for interpreting recent tax acts. tax reform is currently working. we have taken a giant step forward in achieving fairness in the tax code. the number of profitable corporations that are escaping taxation has dropped dramatically from 1986 to 1987. in fact. the average tax rates of americas largest corporations have actually increased under tax reform. in spite of the reduction in the highest corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 40 percent in 1987. it is extremely important that we leave the new improvements to the system intact. to provide stability to the tax code and to allow us to properly analyze the benefits and detriments of tax reform. we should . therefore. utilize this bill to open up debate on the reform we enacted in the tax reform act of 1986. we must  enact any amendments that would violate the original goal of the reform bill: fairness in the tax code. in addition ti the technical corrections. the finance committee has included provisions to extend important tax incentives that have expired or are expiring at the end of this year. the extension of the mortgage revenue bond program is a key element of the efforts of state housing agencies to provide affordable ownership for lowincome americans. homeownership is part of the american dream. yet it has been in decline since 1980. we need to revert that trend. testimony that we have heard in the finance committee proves the success of the mortgage revenue bond programs around the country. the program is targeted toward lower income. firsttime home buyers and has been absolutely necessary to many americans who would  otherwise qualify for a mortgage. statistics from rhode island show that 74 percent of all approved mortgage revenue bond applicants would  have been able to obtain a mortgage through any of the alternative sources available. the other expiring provisions such as the research and experimentation credit. employee educational assistance. low income housing credit. targeted jobs tax credit. and the section 861 expense allocation moratorium are significant and i am glad we were able to include them in this package. aher issue that i believe needs to be addressed this year is s...tion 89. discrimination requirements for employee benefit plans. the requirements enacted in the 1986 bill are complex and regulations to provide additional guidance onthese rules have  been issued by the treasury department. without additional clarification. employers will  be able to comply with these rules on a timely basis. during the finance committee action i have worked to clarify the rules and provide american employers with the opportunity to comply. i am glad we were able to provide additional safe harbor provisions and to improve the rules without endangering the effectiveness of the discrimination requirements. this bill also includes an amendment that will correct a problem with the collection of the diesel fuel excise tax created by a provision in the budget reconciliation act of 1987. offroad users of diesel fuel have always been exempt from paying the 15centper gallon excise tax. because this tax is collected for the highway trust fund. as a result of the recent change in law. commercial fishermen are  forced to pay this tax at the time of purchase. the fishermen must then apply to the internal revenue service for a refund of a tax from which they are exempted by law. this is government intrusion at its worst: collecting a tax from the fishermen which they dont even owe. and withholding it for a year. the burden is particularly onerous because fishing crews mally divided up the profits from a fishing trip. if a portion of these profits were withheld for a year. it would be difficult. if  impossible. to ensure that each fisherman receives a fair share when the refund check arrives. i want to make it clear that i agree with the intent of the budget reconciliation act. which is to collect more efficiently the diesel excise tax from highway users. therefore. i am glad that we have been able to develop a proposal that will allow these fishermen to buy diesel fuel without paying the tax while keeping in place the more efficient collection process. this bill includes many other substantive changes in the law that are necessary to carry out the intent of the 1986 act. we have  included provisions that would violate the goal of tax reform to make our tax laws fairer for all taxpayers. i would urge my colleagues to defeat any amendment that would violate the goal of providing overall fairness in the tax code.
it is 2 percent or 3 called percent. whatever it may be. begin-  ford does it mr. stevens. that includes the in2year crease of cost of training. travel. subscriptions. everything. at a time when they the cost of living is 4 percent. we are peful- requiring the committees to hold their office cost down on an annual basis. i am sure the senator understands that. we did limit the- committees. in-.: terms of their possible expansion.
i -guess we are all going to be here in the 102d congress. so i look forward to seeing this zerobased budget come into effect because i think it is the right way to proceed. i k the chairman has a very difficult job. one comes to him and says. "cut my budget." and indeed i did . i appeared before him and. like a stalwart. i stood for my committee budget. who does . i guess it is the feeling everybody wants to be treated fairly. if something is to be had. they want it proportionately. obviously. i commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member to look at this from a fresh look. even though it is 2 years away. i hope it is successful.
. i am pleased to join in the introduction of legislation. that is vitally important to the continued improvement of u.s. competitiveness in research and experimental activities. we originally enacted the research and experimental tax credit in 1981 to provide an incentive for american taxpayers to spend more money on research and experimental activities. this incentive has been incredibly successful: since the enactment of the credit. private research and experimental expenditures in the united states have reached record levels. unfortunately. the current structure of the credit does  provide an incentive for american companies to maintain this level of expenditures. at hearings held during the 100th congress by the subcommittee on taxation and debt management of the finance committee. we heard several witnesses. including the treasury department and several ecoists and academics. who testified that we should restructure the base period in order to improve the credits incentive value. under the current structure. a taxpayer must continue to increase the amount of research and experimental expenditures each year. since the credit is computed on the excess expenditures over a base period amount. this base period amount is computed utilizing the research and experimental expenditures for the prior 3 years. this computation causes the base period amount to increase as taxpayers continue to increase research und experimental expenditures. i believe that this structure may provide an incentive for certain companies to reduce research and experimental expenditures for several years. in order to qualify for the credit in later years. the structure proposed in our bill would establish a primary base period amount that will encourage american businesses to increase their research and experimental expenditures over the base period levels and to maintain those levels. however. this base period amount would  be fixed. but would increase as our inal gross national product increases from year to year. these provisions require research and experimental expenditures to be increased by an amount that exceeds the percentage increases in inal gross national product. it is very important that we provide this incentive to american businesses to increase and maintain higher levels of research and experimental expenditures. we need this additional research to regain the competitive edge that we have enjoyed for years. but which we have lost to other nations such as japan. in addition. this legislation will extend the eligibility for the credit to startup companies and new lines of business within existing companies. under the current structure. these startup businesses would  have received the benefits of the credit for their research and experimental expenditures. this new credit will provide a much needed incentive for the creation of new businesses with the purpose of performing research and experimentation. finally. this act would make the credit permanent and thus remove the uncertainty surrounding it. we need to assure american businesses who undertake research activities that the credit will be available permanently. since many research activities will span several years and could exceed any temporary extensions. i urge my colleagues to support this measure that is vitally important to american competitiveness.e by mr. daschle (for himself and mr. kerrey):
. during this time of fiscal restraint. i ask my colleagues to look at this legislation as a much needed investment in the lives and future of our most vulnerable citizens. it is my hope that the senate will approve this legislation and in so doing. recognize the importance of services provided under the title xx social services block grant.g
. i am pleased to be a cosponsor of this senseofthesenate resolution calling for the budget resolution to support the funding increases enacted in last years antidrug abuse act. when the senate passed the mmbus antidrug abuse act last fall we made a serious commitment to solving out national drug problem. we devoted a great deal of time and energy to creating a comprehensive piece of legislation to address the myriad of issues that contribute to our overall drug problem. when senators came together from both sides of the aisle to put together an omnibus bill that could be offered on a bipartisan basis. we set some important ground rules. the most important ground rule was to ensure that whatever funding was available for the drug bill would be appropriated evenly. half for interdiction efforts and half for education. prevention. and treatment programs. as senator moyvxmar has stated. this was a very deliberate decision on the part of those senators participating in the bills development. we agreed that channeling our efforts solely toward either supply or demand reduction would  address the whole issue. reducing the supply of drugs is only effective if we simultaneously reduce the demand for drugs. we believed that both were equally important. and therefore the funding should be evenly divided. we stuck to our agreement and the legislation was approved by the senate. although we were unable to fully fund the measure. the funding that was available was divided evenly between interdiction and treatment programs. this is all very important in relation to our current debate on the budget resolution for fiscal year 1990. the budget committee report specifies that moneys should be increased n the law enforcement and education functions with relation to the drug crisis. in the health function. however. there is direction provided to ensure that treatment programs are funded at a comparable level it is my hope that in our effort to provide more funding for the drug bill. we will continue to support the even split between supply and demand established in the drug bill. thus. i urge my colleagues to support senator moynihans senseofthesenate resolution to fund each of these important approaches to the drug problem about equally. this would be in keeping with the spirit of the law and the intent of those who participated in its development.
. reserving the right to object. i would ask the distinguished manager of the bill. senator mcclure was concerned with the provision dealing with qualified authorizing legislation section 4063. "this act shall be considered qualified authorizing legislation for the purposes of the internal revenue code." that would be part of a committee amendment.
. i commend the administration for coming to terms with the savings and loan crisis so quickly and for proposing the legislation that served as the basis for the conference report on which we are voting today. i also commend the chairman of the banking committee. senator riegle. the ranking member. senator garn. and all the committee members and staff for holding exhaustive hearings. making improvements. and moving the legislation through the conference with the house as expeditiously as they did. the conference report before us is a compromise. i preferred the administrations financing approach because i believe that the practice of raising the deficit but exempting the increase from the only mechanism in place to control the deficitthe gram of the federal reserve board. the secretary of housing and urban development. and two independent memberswho have myriad responsibilities to begin with. i sincerely hope each will devote careful attention to his or her duties that devolve as a result of this legislation.
the estimate that we receivedyou can attack the source of the estimates but. after all. . we operate on estimates all the timethe estimate that we received from the congressional budget office is that 65 percent of the seniors will take the optional premium and the services that are therein provided.
i am going to ask for 5 minutes. it seems to me that the distinguished chairman of the budget committee and the ranking member will obviously have a chance to address the chamber when 9 oclock comes. as i understand it.
. the secretary of the treasury took some action in order to forestall the necessity of cutting off social security payments due to failure of the passage of the increase in debt ceiling. i think that is extremely wise on the part of the secretary of the treasury. as those who have been here before in other years k that we continually get up to this deadline on the failure to pass the increase in the debt ceiling and indeed. in some instances. have had to postpone the payment of those checks. the sending out of those checks. . we have already passed that deadline. but because of the forethought of the secretary of the treasury. mr. brady. we  have an adequate sum in the treasury that. will permit us to send out those checks. and as i understand it. relieve this crisis of the failure to increase the debt ceiling until the end of the month. that is. the end of this month. so i think we all owe a debt of gratitude to the secretary for his wise action in anticipating the failure of this congress to act.  we get right back to it. why have we  done anything on the debt ceiling increase. frankly. it has  even come before us. we have  even had a vote on it. there is all kinds of talk: is it to be a clean debt ceiling. or do we have to forestall loading it up with other items. whether it is catastrophic or capital gains. or whatever it is. it has  even come before us. so i think the secretary of the treasury took very wise action in anticipating the failure of this senate to act. and therefore. i want it to go on public record. the admiration i have.  just because of thishe has been an excellent secretary of the treasurybut because of this particular action. i think we all owe him a debt of gratitude. i thank the chair.
. there are two individuals that particularly deserve tremendous credit for this. i first want to mention the majority leader. as has been said. he ks more about this bill than any other individual. i am confident of that. second. without his persistence. we would  be where we are today. ie changed the formula. he changed the basis on which we are able to get this bill out of committee and take them up and to reach such progress as we have made today. so he has been really the leader of the forces. assisting him so ably throughout this was senator baucus. the senior senator from montana. it was his duty to chair the subcommittee and. indeed. most of the committee actions devolved upon him. he stayed the cause. he stayed on a steady. persistent effort to get this bill  only considered in the committee. reported out. dealt with all the amendments in the conmmittee. but then presided over the majority of all the sessions that we held in the majority leaders office. where we considered this. he certainly added to his reputation as a stellar environmentalist by the actions that he took. we all owe him a deep debt of gratitude for what he did. assisted also. as has been mentionedand i will list some of those that were from our side. without trying to be exclusive in any way because many came in: senators duasn-
those statistics are remarkable. and i think they are worthwhile repeating. people are talking about job loss of 5.000. 6.000. 12.000. could the senator repeat those statistics about how many new jobs have been created in this country of ours over the period he was describing.
the other point i think. the senator made was that the estimates of jobs lost under the air toxics section are 12.000 jobs over an 8year period. starting in the year 2005. those are the statistics. do those check with those of the senator.
. i would like to make comments on the remarks of the senator from missouri and ask him a question. i agree with everything the senator said. indeed. i have been long concerned over this situation. where the present administration is locked into a pledge for tax increases that was made during an election campaign 2 years ago. i might say i find receptivity to an increase in the marginal rates beyond what they are currently. for adding aher bracket. perhaps getting rid of the socalled bubble so the rates would remain at 33 percent for those highincome taxpayers. the problem i find. and i wonder if the senator from missouri has any solution to thisi believe people would be receptive to that type of procedure. i might say. perhaps it can be coupled with the capital gains cut. because unquestionably it is the rich who are going to get most out of the capital gains cut. but the belief is. and i think a correct one. that there is point in doing it unless that money is truly going to go for reduction of the deficit. and so far. it seems to me. one has been able to come up with a solution that guarantes that these funds brought in by an increase in the marginal rate. or adding aher bracket. indeed will go to reducing the deficit. the fear is that a voracious congress will consume those funds and spend them on worthy programs. certainly. whether better education. better health. better day care. but when all is said and done. maybe the country will be a little better off in those categories but the deficit will be better off. what do we do about that dilemma.
i appreciate ments made by the dist chairman of the finance c and the comanager of the bill. senator baueus. it is that we must divise a dedic nue source to assure that th ments of the clean air legis met. i would observe that sor fees in the substitute amendr proposed as well in the cle submitted by the administ congress. further. these part of the amendment pac was carefully negotiated ar upon with the administratio urge that the specific prop were included in the substitu ment receive particular con when the finance committe a tax bill this year.
that .was an assumption that i made. that both lost their jobs directly due to the clean air legislation. that is what this bill is all about. that is what the provision the senator is discussing is about.
i appreciate the chair so informing me. if i can have aher ice at the end of 20 minutes. i will appreciate it. the american beekeepers have a membership of 150.000. how many are members in the american beekeeping federation. 1.800.  18.000. out of 212.000 beekeepers in the united states of america. the two groups have a total membership of 2.400. what is the interest of these groups. representing the interest of beekeepers before legislative bodies. in 1988. there was a congressional quarterly article about these two groups entitled "spirited lobbying." these spirited lobbyists certainly get all over this hill. i would like to get back to a point that is clearly going to be raised here. and that is. pollination. the opponents to this bill are going to say if this legislation passes. there will  be any more bee colonies in the united state and we will  be able to pollinate through bees those fruits and seeds and vegetables where pollination through bees is important. the answer to that is sense. it just is  so. in 1985. the gao released a comprehensive report. as i say. here it is. here is the report of the gao that studied this whole subject in details. and hing substantial has changed since then. this is what the gao said: "since the program was started in 1950. the bee population has shifted to states where honey is produced. yet where there is less need for pollination." the gao then went on to say beekeepers are migrating to midwestern states to take advantage of abundant floral sources from which they can produce honey. they are  migrating to where the pollination of crops is required. many of the states that lost honeybees are actually states that need pollination services. so what have they done. they rent bees for pollination. there is an industry set up to take care of pollination. these producers are strictly involved with producing honey and taking advantage of a very sweet federal program. almost 90 percent of u.s. honey production is placed under loan with the government. think of that. 90 percent of the production in the united states is going into these programs where they can get loans. get it stored. get it back if they want it. leave it there. either way they are winners. so. . i think the argument is pretty clear. this is a program that is strictly tailored to a very few wealthy individuals who .are getting very substantial payments. close to $1 million apiece under this program. i think. as it was said by the initial men who landed on the moon: "one small step forward for mankind." that is what this amendment isa small but important step forward. a savings of $100 million could do a lot for this nation and certainly it would set the tone as we proceed into the budget discussions subsequently in the latter part of this summer and the early fall. i thank the chair. i reserve the remainder of my time.
. i believe we have made a strong case here. i said right from the beginning this is  going to solve the budgetary problems of the united states of america. our problems are far deeper than $100 million. but it is $100 million that can go to better purposes than to take care of a very. very few people who are getting a lot out of the program. perhaps the distinguished presiding officer was  here when i talked of the u.s. department of agriculture studies in 1984. and there is hing that has changed substantially since this. particularly. as you e in the gao report. they said five producers each receive federal loans ranging from $612.000 to $912.000. nearly $1 million. two of our colleagues pointed this out when we were discussing an emergency supplemental in 1987. that 20 beekeepers would be getting $60.000 in benefits under the honey program. so i hope my colleagues who have been listening to this will bear in mind that this is a chance to really save some money for the u.s. government. i point out that there are a lot of desires of different senators for use of federal moneys. of course. one of the uses would be to reduce the deficit. i refer once again to the amount of money that could be used for a particular purpose that appeals. i k. to the hearts of the presiding officer and also of the distinguished senator from south dakota. in 5 fiscal years the program has spent $385 million. that is about $70 million a year. in those 5 fiscal years. we could have used that money to put 27.000 additional children into the head start program. i reserve the remainder of my time.
. the distinguished senator was talking about how the loss in the program is going down and indeed how the supports are going down. i would point out that the senate legislation before us provides that we  go down on the price supports of honey. in other words. currently the loan rate is at 56.86 cents per pound. under the provision that we have before us. it would stay at that. rather than going down where it is set to go down. and indeed as it is in the house legislation. go down to 53.8 cents. in other words. the program was to drop 3 cents a pound. and so we are  in a situation where: "dont worry folks. gradually this program is being eliminated. it is going to cost less." it cost less. as you see in some of these charts. here. as i point out. in 1988 it was $100 million and in 1989 it was $42 million. that is  quite accurate.  what they are proposing to do in the bill before us is to reverse that course. to jsay  we are  going to keep sliding down these price supports. we are going to stay at the 1989 figure. that is the first point. the second point is that where. as we look at this chart and see $100 million in 1988 was the cost of the program and $40 million in 1989. that does  mean that the cost of the program is going down. indeed. it is predicted by the very organization. the cbo. that makes .predictions for us. congressthey predict that next year it will  be $40 million. in 1990 it will. this current fiscal year. be $68 million. as i pointed out over the 5year period it has cost $350 million. which is about averaging $70 million a year. so. do  think this program is costing less. it is . indeed the way they have set it up it will  go down. the distinguished senator from th dakota has somehow tied in the whole survival of agriculture in the nation to this price support program. there is a man who will step right up and make a bold claim. and there is probably something to that. i forgot how. but somehow for a measly investment of $100 million we are saving $19 billion. first of all. as the senator ks. a great deal of pollination in this country does  take place by bees. it takes place by wind. by insects. second. i would harken to the gao report. this is what they said. this is  some scientist who was brought in from the university of michigan king in advance just how he is going to testify. for every scientist from the university of michigan i suspect we could haul one in from the university of arizona or berkeley or someplace who would say exactly the opposite thing. we have all had these experts. you get five and i will get five. weigh them. and they will go anywhere you want.
. i would like to thank the members of the appropriations agriculture subcommittee for the strong support they have shown in this bill for a very important program: the special supplemental food program for women. infants. and children. or wic program. as my colleagues k. wic is one of the federal governments best. and most costeffective. programs. the wic program provides food vouchers to lowincome mothers and their children who are at risk of serious nutritional deficiencies. this special. nutritious food includes milk. infant formula. orange and other juices. cheese. fruit. and cereals. this simple ideamaking sure that mothers and children receive good. basic. nutritious foods and avoid nutritional deficienciesis remarkably effective. studies have shown that every $1 invested in wic saves $3 in longterm health care costs and developmental problems. unfortunately. this program serves only about half of the eligible lowincome. atrisk population. this gap in coverage represents a considerable missed opportunity. considering wics proven effectiveness for an especially vulnerable population. that is bad news. there is much to be gained by expanding wic to reach more of the eligible pouplation. over the past years. i have joined by colleague senator dsconcrni in spearheading an annual drive to make slight but steady increases in wic program funding. so far. these efforts have been successful. in 1989. 71 of our colleagues joined us in requesting an additional $150 million over current services for 1990 wic funding. as a result. wic was eventually funded at $2.13 billion. while last years funding for wic went far. much of its benefit was inadvertently conteracted by a new problem unexpected rises in food inflation. in june. the national association of wic directors revealed that recent food package inflation will have a significant impact on their ability to serve eligible mothers and children. for the greater part of 1990. many states have reported food inflation of greater than 7 percent. much higher than the usdaprojected rate of 4.5 percent. that rise in inflation means a significant gap in wic coveragesince dollars wont stretch as far. wic caseloads must be reduced. let me tell you what has happened in my home state of rhode island. in this fiscal year. our wic program served 15.700 women. infants. and children. but because rhode islands food package inflation jumped to. 12 percent. 500 wic participants were taken off the states caseload. that is 500 women. infants. and children eligible for wic who lost out because of inflation. so wic funding is especially vital this year. and this year. we were able to garner even more senate support for wic. in july. 80 senators joined senator dncoxcnu and me once again to request $150 million over current services for wic. and both the house and senate committees have responded by allocating $2.35 billion for the wic program. the increase of $234 million is $10 million less than our request. but it is also the single largest addition to wic we have seen in recent years. i congratulate the members of the appropriations committee for moving to expand wic in fiscal year 1991. increasing funding for wic is the right thing to do only from the humanitarian point of view. but also from the most harded. costversusbenefit point of view. wic is one federal program that saves more than it spends. and deserves every bit of support we can give it.
it is also our understanding that the unfortunate timing of the approval of s. 830 by the house created an inadvertent dilemma in funding this important project. specifically. the senate did  receive until october 4 the houseapproved billwhich authorized $3 million for a new program of demonstration projects. $1 million of which was specified for fiscal year 1991. i applaud the house for taking action. however. because of the timing of that action. the senate was unable to consider including that approved demonstration project funding in this appropriation before us today. we would like to clarify with the distinguished manager that it remains the intent of the senate to fully fund the $3 million demonstration program.
. on tuesday. the senate approved the conference report on h.r. 5268. the fiscal year 1991 agriculture appropriations bill. i would like to extend my appreciations to the members of the conference for including $2.35 billion for the special supplemental food program for women. infants. and children. or wic. their action literally will help millions of women and children avoid nutritional deficiencies and stay healthy. the conference committees action is particularly timely given the recent news about wic. on october 1. the u.s. department of agriculture transmitted to congress an important new study that shows conclusively that wic is one of the smartest and most costeffective programs we have.
. although this package may  contain all of the elements of deficit reduction i believe are important. and although it does  contain all of the spending provisions i believe are necessary to assist the children of this nation. i believe it is the best we can do this year. i will support the package. and urge my colleagues to do likewise.
. today i am introducing a package of three bills designed to help resolve the terrible financial institutions crisis that is currently gripping rhode island. one month ago. on new years day. the newly inaugurated gover of rhode island declared a "banking emergency" in our state. fortyfive financial institutions were forced to close35 credit unions. and 10 banks. in total. nearly $1.8 billion in assets were impounded. nearly onequarter of all rhode islanders. 250.000 citizens. had their personal accounts frozen. what happened in rhode island. our state is 1 of 20 that allow financial institutions to operate without federal deposit insurance coverage. the rhode island share and deposit insurance corp. erisdic] was a scandalously mismanaged private deposit insurer that was weakened considerably when forced to take over one of its ailing institutions in ember 1990. by new years day. the risdic reserve fund was exhausted. leaving thousands of depositors unprotected and forcing the gover to close down the 45 uninsured institutions. a great deal of fingerpointig is taking place at home in rhode island. investigations are underway. reports are being written. and there is plenty of blame to go around. the risdic board of directors. the rhode island state legislators. the state regulators. officials at the closed institutions themselves. those who manage the institutions. or mismanaged them in many instances. must all bear part of the responsibility for this banking and credit union calamity. it is  my job to assign fault. my primary concern is to help the inent depositors who are the unfortunate victims of this crisis. and to ensure that assistance is available for those facing similar problems in other states in the future. i have a package of bills. but the first bill is the rhode island depositor tax relief act. which is designed to provide temporary tax relief to rhode islanders so they might get through this hardship period. the second is the financial assistance to institutions reform act. the fair act. which would direct the u.s. treasury department to provide emergency loans to states that have been affected by the collapse of a federal deposit insurance fund. the third piece of legislation is the qualified depostor protection bond act to allow a states private deposit insurance fund for state chartered financial institutions to issue taxexempt bonds. let me explain how each of these work. let us start with the rhode island depositor relief act. it is straightforward. it is a federal tax relief bill. it would provide temporary relief to individuals and to businesses in rhode island that are unable to gain access to funds frozen in closed institutions. under this act. those individuals and businesses would have the option to defer the payment of their remaining 1990 and their 1991 income tax liability until the earlier of april 15. 1992. 30 days after the institution reopens. or the depositor is made whole by the state of rhode island. the amount of tax that may be deferred is limited to the amount of funds that are  available because of the banking emergency. in other words. your relief is limited to the amount of funds that are in one of these institutions where the accounts are frozen. for example. if an individual has $25 in a closed credit union. that person may defer only $25 of his or her taxes.  a penny more. the tax relief provided for 1990 allows a business or individual to defer the payment of the remaining portion of their 1990 federal income tax liability. for most individuals and businesses. the amount that may be deferred for 1990 would be the amount of the tax due. if any. on that individuals personal income tax return or the business return. after subtracting any previous tax amounts that have al* ready been paid for 1990. let us see how it works for 1991. the tax relief for 1991 would allow an individual to be exempt from the employer withholding rules for the federal income tax. this exemption would eliminate the employer withholding of the income tax and. thus. allow people to receive the full amount of their salary before income taxes. in additional. all estimated tax payment requirements and penalties would be waived until april 15. 1992. or 30 days after the depository institution reopens. whichever was the earlier. this is  a federal handout. all deferred taxes would have to be paid to the internal revenue service by the earlier of april 15. 1992. or 30 days after the institution reopens. or the depositors are made whole by the state. this bill would simply grant some forebearance to those rhode islanders most harmed by the states banking crisis. the second bill. the socalled fair act. would establish a $500 million energency lowinterest loan fund at the treasury department to provide financial disaster assistance to states where a federally insured deposit corporation has folded. has become insolvent. in order to establish this loan fund. the u.s. department of treasury would be directed to issue up to $500 million in bonds and es. this pool of capital would be made available on a competitive basis to qualifying states up to $150 million per state. so the total fund is $500 million. the maximum that can to to one state is $150 million. to help state governments replenish depositors accounts up to $100.000 at those closed institutions. banks or credit unions. states would then repay the loan over a 10year period at a slightly reduced interest rate. to be eligible for a loan through the fair act. the state would be required to submit a comprehensive financial institutions reorganization plan that must be approved by the secretary of the treasury. the secretary will have the discretion to accept or to modify any plan submitted to his department as a condition of the loan. the secretary could deny any application. if the secretary deems that the state is unable to fulfill the terms of the loan. moreover. financial institutions that are allowed to reopen or merge with other insititutions under the approved plan would be required to secure federal insurance coverage either through the national credit union administration encuai or through the federal deposit insurance corporation [fdic]. to receive this loan from the federal government. the state would require that those reopening institutions secure federal insurance coverage. we in rhode island are  going back to this private insurance business anymore. i have been in touch with the gover of rhode island to discuss this fair act. i have asked him and his staff to evaluate just how helpful such a loan program could be to states suffering from the shock and ecoic hardship of a collapsed insurance fund. here is what i was told: the state governments around the nation are tightening their belts. at least 29 states. from california to massachusetts. will run a deficit in 1991. revenues are falling and services are growing.  add to this bleak forecast the potential collapse of a deposit insurance fund and you can see the difficulties. deep difficulties that will be faced by a state confronting that situation where does a financially strapped state. already operating in the red. come up with $50 million or $150 million to ensure that its ecoy does  collapse. it is such a desperate scenario that confronts rhode island today. and could hit any number of states down the road. according to the congressional research service. at least 20 states allow federally backed insurance corporations to guarantee depositors accounts. if there is one message i could send out to every one of those states today. it would be to their regulators to check those insurance funds and see if they are solid. see if they can take and endure the failure of one of their institutions. but more importantly. check the institutions. how solid are those institutions. those that are  solid. close them before they get into further difficulties. so that they are  confronted with the situation that we currently face in rhode island where whole series of factors led to the extremely desperate situation that currently exists.
i further say. . that it makes eminent sense to me. i think we certainly want to work out a system with the saudis whereby there is  a tax levied on those particular calls. we are in a modem world where apparently there is considerable accessibility to telephone over three and that is a form of communication that our service men and women are using. i think we ought to encourage it and certainly there is need for anybody to add a tax. for the saudis to add a tax to those particular calls. so i support the joint resolution and hope that it will achieve passage. i want to thank the chair. and i want to thank the distinguished acting leader. schedule
madam president. last fall in the senate and. indeed. in the entire congress. we engaged in a lengthy and sometimes heated debate on the fairest and most responsible means of reducing the federal budget deficit. that debate culminated in the bipartisan budget summit agreement. although that agreement has  brought about immediate reduction in the deficit. it has put in place a new set of rules governing congressional spending. this is kn as "payasyougo." according to the payasyougo program. one category of the budget can grow above a certain amount unless there is a corresponding reduction in aher program in that category. important new initiatives under these ground rules that we have . initiatives dealing with better prenatal care for expectant mothers. for example. better care for children in the health programs. a whole series of measures that we all believe in. would require a corresponding reduction in aher program in that category. obviously. madam president. if we want one of these new programs. it faces a difficult path to enactment because there has to be this offset by reductions in other domestic programs. that is what we call pay as you go. i supported the payasyougo approach. and i think it is safe to say most of the senate supported that. throughout the eighties and  into the nineties we have been talking about the urgency of reducing the deficit. there is  an individual senator who has  been out on the stump in his or her home state proclaiming how important it is to reduce the deficit. we have put in place a mechanism which holds great promise for imposing serious discipline on congressional spending. i believe we ought to adhere to this principle. and we ought to adhere to it in setting the budgets under which our own committees operate. however. madam president. we do  have that in this measure before us . this is payasyougo principle. that is iged in this resolution. senate resolution 62 provides budget authority to the standing special and select committees of the senate. in accordance with the practices of the senate. earlier this year the chairmen and the ranking members of the 19 committees being funded by this resolution went before the rules committee to request funding levels for the next 2 fiscal years. this is a measure that covers 2 years. we will  be back here on this for 2 more years. this is the last shot until then. the rules committee suggested the increases of 4.1 percent for salaries and 5 percent for administrative expenses. they suggested that that should be sufficient. while most chairmen and ranking members requested funding up to or below the suggested level. six committees have requested additional funds to create new positions and permanent positions on those committees. the rules committee has agreed to add these new positions. however. the rules committee has  sought to offset this increase by cutting back elsewhere in the budget. thus. the rules committee proposes that spending for several committees should grow above the mal amount. but it is  willing to offset this growth by cutting back someplace else. madam president. this is  a pay as you go. it is a spendasyougo program. it seems to me altogether inappropriate for the senate once again to vote to exempt itself from the restrictions we have imposed elsewhere in the budget. that is what we would be doing it we allow these few committees to grow without an offset in a larger committee. since the beginning of the committee system as it exists today. we have seen a steady growth in the size of committee staffs. some of that growth is to be expected. and. indeed. i looked back and saw what the size of the committees were in 1950. i found that the total size of the committees in 1950 was 300. i suppose we could say the committee responsibilities have grown. and as the committee responsibilities have grown so have the staffs. as a matter of fact. one of the reasons i fought against the new hart building. was because there is a theory which i believe is accurate that size increases to available space. if you have the space. the committee staffs will grow to meet that space. so there is a certain virtue in the old cramped quarters that we had where people could hardly move around. i k it was substandard in every category but at least it served to holddown the staffs to some extent. i have mentioned the staffs were 300 in 1950. by 19170 they were 635. they doubled. and from 635 in 1970. they have nearly doubled to 1.203 in 1990. recognizing that the committee staffs have become inflated. in 1981. under the leadership of the republican majority. committee staffs were reduced by 14 percent. that was a step in the right direction. however. today there are three committees with well over 100 fulltime permanent staff positions. what are they. governmental affairs. 124. judiciary. 138. labor. 124. there is committee that has more responsibilities. a bigger agenda. encompassing more areas than the finance committee. yet the finance committee has a total staff membership of 57. indeed. . they are asking for 7 more positions to make it 64 for next year and then it goes down to 63. but even at that. let us take the worse figure. 64. at 64. they would be less than half the size of the judiciary committee. they would be about half the sizes of the labor committee and half the size of the governmental affairs committee. think of that. the committee with probably the heaviest responsibilities can get along with half the staff of the governmental affairs. the judiciary. and the labor committees. needless to say. the budget authorization for these committees reflect their girth. in the resolution that we have before us. the rules committee has included funding above the recommended 4.1percent increase for six committees. these six committees requested the additional funds for the creation of 29 new fulltime permanent positions and 7 temporary positions. for a grand total of 36 new positions. and. that will make the total number of positions in the senate for the staff of the committees 1.239. that is an increase of 96 percent since 19701.239. perhaps those committees need additional positions. i have heard good arguments and supported the request of the finance committee for additional staff. our chairman made a good presentation. i am  going to impose a judgment on whether those other committees who asked for new positions require them. whether their workload has increased. whether the productivity sought from them is more demanding than before. this is what my amendment does. madam president. it says that in order for those committees to grow. a reduction in the three oversized committees is required. in other words. my amendment is very simple. it would cap the total number of positions authorized at the 1990 level. that would mean 1.203 permanent committee staff positions. if a committee needed to increase its staff above this level. as perhaps is the case with the six committees requesting additional funding. the rules committee would be required. if they deem that this was a worthy case. to seek an equal reduction of positions from one or a combination of the three extra large committees. those three committees with more than 100 authorized staff positionsgovernmental affairs. judiciary. or labor. what my amendment does. madam president. is seek to limit excessive growth in committee staff. it does  seek to restrict legitimate growth. once again. if we are to apply the payasyougo approach to all other spending in the budgetand that is what we have done. if you want to do something to help the elderly. if you want to do something to help the medically indigent. if you want to do something to provide better care for children or improve education. you have to take it from elsewhere within that category. and so it goes with defense. if we want a new program. we have to take it from somewhere else in the defense budget. madam president. let me conclude by saying what this does is endorse the payasyougo approach. this does  neglect the costofliving that is sought. this does  keep out the increase that is sought for the salary items in the budget. we keep that. what it does is hold down the number of positions and thus also hold down the spending. madam president. i very strongly believeand i think if you took a poll in the senate. they would all say the same thingthat what we demand of other sections of the government. of the departments of the government. we should impose upon ourselves. i think it behooves us to set an example. so. madam president. that is the gist of the amendment. madam president. how much time do i have remaining.
all right. we are talking about those that are authorized. if there are vacancies. we are  saying to some committee that has vacancies. you were thrifty. you did the right thing in  filling these positions for the budget committee. for -example. you can fill them later. we did  punish those committees under this amendment. madam president i ask for the yeas and nays.
. i ask leads to double taxation and increases unanimous consent that the full text their worldwide tax liability. removal of the bill. a copy of a document entitied "a primer on 861r&d." and a copy of the highlights and the executive summary of the new report from the council on competitiveness appear in the racord following my statement.*
. like all of my colleagues in congress. i would like very much to help working americans. however. i do  believe we should place a large burden on the backs of future workers in order to provide a small benefit to our current workers. instead. we should diligently pursue measures that reduce the deficit. stimulate the ecoy. and provide jobs for the millions of unemployed americans. this is the only honest way to help both current and future american workers. i hope this amendment will be defeated.

ok. here is the problem as i see it. under the senators amendment. in the first fiscal year. 1993. which is the first year the amendment will be applicable. the program would have to be cut in order to pay for this program and those programs. fune 18. 1991 under the budgetary system we  have set up. in order to pay for this program. the cuts would have to be made under the socalled domestic discretionary cap. in other words. to get his extra money for his first payment out under the byrd amendment. you have to get the money from someplace that is under the cap. therefore you have to look around amongst health care. education. nutrition. housing environment. and so forth. i am just talking 1993 . . that is the problem of the senators amendment as i see it. i will  get into the question of the increase in the deficit. but i will just stick to that one question. then i would follow up. with what happens in the following fiscal years. but i will just stick with that first point right .

if i might have the attention of the distinguished manager of the bill. i would like to clarify one point in the bill with regard to the establishment of an internal revenue service tollfree call answering site in rhode island. the house approved bill and the bill as reported to the senate by the appropriations committee recommend an appropriation of $1.661.298.000 for the department of the treasury account entitled "processing tax returns and assistance." it is my understanding that the house report (h. rept. 102109) expresses that bodys intention that from the total appropriation for that account. $3.800.000 shall be made available for a tollfree call answering site in rhode island.
if i might have the information. is it the senator from arattention of the distinguished manag- izonas understanding that before atf er of the bill. i would like to clarify is able to access the great system. one point in the bill with regard to the guidelines will be developed for puestablishment of an internal revenue poses of updating and entering inforservice tollfree call answering site in mation into the great system. rhode island. the house approved mr. deconcini. yes. that is my unbill and the bill as reported to the derstanding. in fact. in the committee senate by the appropriations commit- report. we state that before any funds tee recommend an appropriation of are to be expended. we expect atf to $1.661.298.000 for the department of submit a comprehensive plan on the treasury account. entitled "processink center that includes how atf will intax returns and assistance." it is my tegrate and use information from understanding that house report 102- other law enforcement agencies. it is 109 expresses that bodys intention my understanding that atf will work that from the total appropriation for with the los angeles county sheriffs that account. $3.800.000 shall be made office to ensure that there is agreeavailable for a tollfree call answering ment on how information from the site in rhode island. great system will be used.
 and the congress urged substantially increased funding for wicin fact. 86 of our colleagues joined senator decoiqcinx and myself in requesting a full $2.7 billion for wic. this remarkable support comes from the fact that we all recognize that being prowic is being both prochildren and probusiness. and tha~t is proamerica. as we all k. the budget agreement of last year placed severe restraints on everyone. it appears. however. that some appropriations subcommittee allocations may be revised later during the house and senate conference. if this should occur. and the allocation for the agriculture subcommittee be increased. i would join my friend from arizona in requesting that the senate conferees accept the higher appropriations for wic in the house measure. while it may appear small. that additional $27 million could provide foods for tens of thousands of additional lowincome mothers and children.
. i concur wholeheartedly with the need for appropriate rules to curtail abusive circumvention schemes designed to avoid antidiscrimination requirement for qualified retirement plans. however. i share the concerns of many physicians that efforts to implement the leased employee section of the tax code. as it currently stands. would result in unworkable and overreaching regulations. the legislation that senator daschle and i offer today will clarify the leased employee provision of the tax code in a manner that prevents abuses and simplifies administration of these requirements. i respectfully urge my colleagues to review this bill and join us as cosponsors of this important corrective legislation.e by mr. roth:
i want to say to my good friend from connecticut. he is exactly right. let me just talk to one of the provisions. one of these socalled extenders. currently. there exists in the law the socalled mortgage revenue bonds. wherein a state can issue taxexempt bonds to provide mortgages for lowincome americans. individuals who meet certain income requirements can borrow from that fund and thus get money at a lower interest rate than he would mally pay in a conventional mortgage. he will be. able to either purchase a home or have a home built. most likely. he will purchase a home.. in the last 2 years. almost 50 percent of the mortgages in my state are pursuant to this mortgage revenue bond program. . this expires. it does  do much good to say. "oh. dont worry. well extend it sometime in march or april." if there is anything we need under the revenue code. it is definiteness. particularly when we think of my distinguished colleague from connecticut. he comes from a hightechogy state. one of the virtues of the internal revenue code that is going to expire is the research and development tax credit. if a company invests more in research and development. they get a credit. . what could be more encouraging to create jobs in this country. to keep us on the cutting edge of techogy than this particular provision. this leads to jobs. however. it expires at the end of this year. if we go away from here without doing anything about it. business can make their plans. it is  egh to say to the business. well. maybe in june you will get it back.
. while i reluctantly rise in opposition.  solely for the procedural reasons but also for the reason i just do  think it is going to do the job. i would commend our good friend from new mexico to keep up his efforts. he is giving us leadership on this side of the aisle. anyway. and i hope we continue to look at reinstituting the investment tax credit which i really think will do something positive. to pull us out this recession. i thank the senator from texas.
. the bill i am introducing today would provide temporary relief to individuals in rhode island who may be required to pay a capital gains tax on the sale of their principal residence. under the internal revenue code. homeowners may defer the payment of tax on the sale of their original residence by purchasing a new principal residence within 2 years. either before or after. of the date of sale of the old principal residence. under current law. the irs does  have the authority to waive this 2year requirement. however. an exception does exist to provide additional 2 years for taxpayers whose tax home is outside of the united states after the date of sale of their original residence. many rhode islanders who sold their homes within the last 2 years have  been able to replace their principal residence under the 2year rollover rules. these individuals placed the cash proceeds from the sale of their old residence in a rhode island financial institution that remains closed pursuant to the bank holiday declared by the gover of rhode island on january 1. 1991. as a result. these individuals have  been able to purchase a new principal residence because they do  have access to their downpayments that are frozen in one of these institutions. this bill would provide these rhode islanders with 2 additional years in which to replace their principal residence by expanding the exception- for taxpayers with a tax home outside of the united states by providing these taxpayers with additional time. they should be able to purchase a new home and defer the tax that would otherwise be due on the gain from the sale of their original residence. as a result of the collapse of the state bank insurance fund and the bank holiday declared by the gover. these rhode islanders will be penalized by the 2year rollover rule. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill so that we can enact it early next year and allow these individuals to avoid this unfair result.* by mr. iye:
i. too. would like to thank the senator from texas and the senator from maine for their suppot of efforts to remove the onerous tax. the luxury tax was enacted by congress as a symbolic tax the rich gesture. -unfortunately it has turned out to be a policy disasterinstead of soaking the rich. it is devastating the workers who build these boats. i am hopeful that theirsupport will encourage the senate to repeal this tax as of january 1. 1992. .thereby salvaging the boat show selling season -for those american boat manufacturers who are still in business.
. i would like to ask the distinguished ranking member of the finance committee a question. do i understand this measures that has been brought back to us has greater taxes than either of the measures that were passed in the house or the senate. in other words. as i understand it. in the senate bill. it provided for $51 billion of tax rate increases. i think all have said beware. beware when they start down that slippery slope of raising taxes. and the senate bill was only going to touch thosethe senator can correct me. but i believe it was at $150.000 of income for singles and $175.000 of income for families. and the total taxes raised was $51 billion. . lo and behold. out of the conference. where both the house bill and the senate bill started with $51 billion of tax rate increases. what do we have . surprise. surprise. it is  $51 billion. if i am correct. it is $60 billion. so just overnight. it goes up $9 billion in new taxes. my question to my distinguished leader on the finance committee is: does the conference report still starting the tax at $175.000 per family. or per chance has it come down the way we all said it would.
well. the point i am making is that this country is spending $400 billion that it does  have. that it is borrowing. in order to fund  only defense. which is say $300 billion. but other programs as well. in other words. the point i am making is that we have a long way to go before we are even close to balancing this budget. and to term. as some do. any savings we make in defense as a peace dividend is violating the truth in labeling act. because the facts are. it is dividend. it is just reducing the amount we are borrowing from our children. . is that the interest portion of our budget is  the highest single item. $300 billion a year. and  a nickel of that for principal. that is solely for interest. so. i do hope my colleagues will respond to the urgent pleas that have been made on this side. do  tear down this wall. let us assure everybody. and particularly our children and grandchildren. that we are doing what we can to see that these deficits are reduced. if we cut defensewhatever the amount is. and we will debate that. whether it is $50 billion or $90 billion. whatever the sumlet us have it all go to reduce this horrible deficit which is going to so dog our children and grandchildren in the future. i thank the chair.
one of them might have been mine. i think the senator from arkansas will testify that. on this side of the aisle. i have been one of the biggest budget cutters there is. i think i joined with the senator from arkansas time and time again in voting. for example. about the sdi program and. indeed. we have made progress. the senator from arkansas and i were the prime leaders about one of the most ridiculous spending items that came before this body as he well ks. the recommissioning of 30yearold battleships. a fight in which we went after battleship  1 and lost. went after battleship  2 and lost. i do  think we got more than 35 votes at our high watermark.
i just want to say the senator from arkansas has put his finger right on the very. very political_ ly sensitive programs that are there. sometimes they are called entitlements. and the fact of the matter is that unless people from this side and people from that side get together with the administration and say somehow we are going to wrestle with these programs and get them under control. this country is never going to straighten itself out. and we will get in worse and worse condition. i personally believeand i would be interested if the senator from arkansas confirms thisthat one of the reasons this recession is so difficult and. that we are  coming out of it like we have in past recessions is because of the overhang of the federal debt.  only the deficit which we are running every year. but the debt that is overhanging this nation. i believe that has changed the equation from past situations. the point is that unless we get control of this situation. it is going to get worse and worse in the future. the senator from arkansas has just pointed out. he discussed seven programs.
yes. if i might continue the conversation with the distinguished senator from tennessee. the figures he is quoting are the figures that the president has proposed. i subscribe to the presidents program. i am  suggesting that the program that the president has suggested.  the program that has come out of the budget committee. is going to create this total chaos that we saw at the end of world war il that is  the point. what we are debating here is a resolution that would further cut. what the budget committee has proposed. that is where i worry.
. i shall vote against the amendment. it is clear disabled veterans pensions are  going to be affected one iota under the domenici proposal. the real question is: are we going to make any effort to control the deficits of this nation. which are going to have to be paid by our children. everyone says we must do something about the deficits as long as our efforts are guaranteed  to affect anyone. currently. deficits are at the rate of $400 billion a year. the net interest on the federal debt is $200 billion per year and increasing every year. that $200 billion per year is payment on interest. e of those dollars go for principal payments. but all is solely for interest. if we are going to deal with the entitlements. we can exempt every program thereunder. even though some programs. such as disabled veterans. would be unaffected. the domenici approach is  perfect and. i hope. will be improved as we go through the legislative process. etheless. it is an honest attempt to deal with the deficits.
. 2 weeks ago. i voted against the amendment to take down the socalled firewall governing the limits on military and domestic spending in the federal budget for fiscal year 1993. this amendment would have allowed reductions in defense spending to be used for domestic programs. rather than to reduce the deficit as called for by the budget enforcement act of 1990. both the house and senate have  reaffirmed -support for the discipline imposed by that budget agreement. refusing to remove the firewall. this is  an easy choice since it is clear that we need to resolve urgent domestic problems such as the lack of adequate health care. housing. and education. but the budget agreement does  prevent us from working within the domestic discretionary cap to identify programs that have proven to be effective and deserve priority during the appropriations process. april 10. -1992 as the appropriations committee begins to assign priorities within the domestic discretionary cap for the coming fiscal year. this amendment sends an important signal. for senator deconcinx and myself. increased funding for wic has long been a priority. the wic program provides food to lowincome mothers and their children who are at risk of serious nutritional deficiencies. it sounds simple. but making sure that mothers and children receive good. basic. nutritious foods and avoid nutritional deficiencies is remarkably effective. we k beyond a shadow of a doubt that for every $1 invested. wic saves about $3 in longterm health care costs and developmental problems. a usda study has documented that for every pregnant woman who participated in wic. thegovernment saved between $277 and $598 more in medicaid costs in the first 60 days after birth than for a pregnant woman who did  participate. the savings are important. but that is  all we should thank wic" for. wic reaches infants and children at the most critical stage in their physical and mental development. without proper rishment. the cognitive development of a young child can be severely impaired and can mean impairment of cognitive functions. that child is then behind the curve in terms of learning ability. and he or she isnt even 5. wic also helps mothers. it helps them understand more about good nutrition. and it eases their entry into the health care system. a mother who is used to going by the community health center to pick up the wic foods feels more comfortable going back to the center for medical care. or for referrals to other agencies that can help her. sadly. however. this worthwhile program serves only about half of the eligible population. in rhode island. for example. an estimated 32.000 women. infants. and children are eligible for wic benefits. but funding levels permit only 17.550 to be served. rising food costs. especially in these difficult ecoic times. also have diminished the purchasing power of wic dollars and have forced states to limit their wic caseloads. this gap in coverage represents a considerable missed opportunity. considering wics proven effectiveness for an especially vulnerable population. of course i am preaching to the choir: congress ks of wics benefits. and has given the program considerable support. and for good reason: wic means healthy children. and healthy children can learn. and eventually become productive members of tomorrows work force. increasing funding for wic is the right thing to do only from the harded. cost versus benefit point of view. wic is one federal program that saves more than it spends. and deserves every bit of support we can give it. i urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this amendment.
. the senate has twice expressed its desire to eliminate this tax. in ember of last year. 82 senators voted in favor of a senseofthesenate resolution supporting repeal of the luxury tax. again early this year. the senate included the repeal of the luxury tax as part of the tax bill passed by the senate. given the overwhelming level of support for repealing this tax. i hope that we can finally do just that. i commend the efforts of senators danforth and bomnq in introducing this bill today. through their efforts. we can take some positive steps toward helping our ecoy by extending these tax provisions and repealing the luxury tax.e
so to praise somebody for submitting a balanced budget in arkansas is the faintest praise i have ever heard. that is news. that is dog bites man. i think what would make news in arkansas is man bites dog. the gover does  submit a balanced budget. would i be correct in suggesting that would really make the news.
that is right. i served with the other prior republican gover. who i believe served 4 years. that would be gov. winthrop rockefeller. i would like to also point out something that the senator from arkansas perhaps might be interested in sharing with us. if i am incorrect. i would be glad to hear it. of course. what makes gover clinton submit balanced budgets. as the senator from arkansas says. is because it is in the constitution. just before we went out for recess. once again. the republicans tried to have a balanced budget amendment presented here. and if i am  mistaken. the senator from arkansas voted against that balanced budget amendment. and so did his colleague. also aher former gover of arkansas. so there we made an effort to require a balanced budget. indeed. we had two consecutive votes. we had one on june 30. and we had one on july 2. just before we went out. both times. both senators from arkansas voted against that balanced budget amendment. which seems strange in view of the fact that considerable praise has been heaped upon gover clinton because he produced balanced budgets pursuant .to the constitution of the state of arkansas. so we have sought balanced budget amendments here. but have  received thesupport of the majority of the democrats. the overwhelming majority of the democrats.
. anybody in the nation. matter how rich. can put $2.000 a year aside in an account. this is after taxes. it is  a deduction. and then at the end of 5 yearsi do  k why it is an ira. in ira. "r" stands for retirement. there is retirement involved in this. you just wait 5 years. i think this violates the truthinlabeling law by calling it an ira. it has. hing to do with retirement. at the end of 5 years. you can take out all the buildup. all the money. tax free. so let us take this case. suppose you put in $2.000 a year for 5 years. you have $10.000 in there. and then you keep putting in $2.000 per year up to 10 years. you can take out the first $10.000 you put in plus all the appreciation. let us say you put it in coca cola and it doubles. you can take that all out tax free. who has ever heard of a bonanza like this. the thing that astonishes me. some people in this chamber have worries about cutting the capital gains rate. this is cutting the capital gains rate to zero. tax.
. while the distinguished senator from connecticut is still on the floor. i wonder if he would be good egh to answer a couple of questions that i might have. i would like to ask the senator from connecticut if he is conscious of the second portion of this ira proposal. the socalled back loaded provision. if you would. is he aware it is  the mal ira that you are familiar with. wherd you can contribute and thus take a deduction. the socalled backloaded provision. in the best estimates that we can get. will cost $17 billion of lost revenue a year. let me just describe it. and perhaps the senator is familiar with it. the socalled backloaded provision permits anyone. regardless of income. to put into an ira after taxes. $2.000 per year. the buildup is tax free. and when one comes to take the money out. which can be as early as 5 years. the total proceeds are tax free.  just the contribution you originally made but the total appreciation. dividends. interest. whatever it might be. is the senator familiar with that provision.
the senator is absolutely right. if you can be fortunate egh to invest it in merck. cocacola. and maybe you triple your money like any other citizen in the united states. you take that money out tax free.
i am  for that. but we spent a lot of time on that yesterday. but this cap. of course. has  gone with the backholding or the second part of the ira section that we dis- the presiding officer. if there mined in the same manner as under section cussed yesterday. namely. the ability be further debate. the question is on i(f)(4). to put in the deductible $2.000 and agreeing to the amendment.

. we can put these workers back to work immediately by committing to repeal the luxury tax this year and doing so retroactively to january 1. the international boat show is occurring in newport. ri. this week. by adopting this resolution we can demonstrate that we do recognize the problems we created by enacting this tax. furthermore. we can demonstrate that we plan to fix these problems this year.
. i would like to express my support for the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1993 and engage in a brief colloquy with the senators from alaska and hawaii on the subject of defense conversion. title vii of this bill. defense reinvestment for ecoic growth. provides $2 billion for transition benefits for military and civilian employees of the department of defense. for assistance to communities and industries affected by the military drawdown. and for research and development activities. the committee report es thatthe major impact of a reduction in defense spending will be felt in those states and industries that rely heavily on defense. for many of these states and industries. the ecoic outlook--and thus. the potential to adjust to changes in defense spending--appears bleak. in light of this information i would like the senators assurance that those states with high percentages of defenserelated employees will be adequately addressed by this legislation.
i have a comment in connection with the amendment. . there are very. very difficult new times. as evidenced by the budget we just passed here a couple of days ago. which has a $1 billion cut from the current level a $1 billion cut from the requested amount. but from the current amount. so i join in the tribute to senator boren for the leadership he has given. and also i want to salute senator murkowsk for what he has done.
from the committee on armed services: mr. nunn and mr. thurmond to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate insists upon its amendments to the bill "an act making appropriations for the department of defense for the fiscal year ending september 30. 1993 and for other purposes." requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. iye. mr. liolluos. mr. joh
so any municipality palities to start issuing more industhat issues bonds has a cap imposed on trial revenue bonds. they were doing it based on its financial power to repay that. they were doing it for law offices. the bond. so. in effect. there is a cap. they were doing it for bowling alleys.
. as i mentioned these will be considered en bloc. the treasury depaxtment has several good government proposals they would like to add in the bill. that is the first amendment. the second is dealing with lowincome tax credits regarding the victims of disasters. and the third is indian enterprise zones.
. in this bill that is before us. there are several measures that are extremely important to my state. and i am just in favor of the thrust of the legislation. these measures are  solely important to my state. they are important to the nation as a whole. but incidentally. have greater effect in my state than perhaps in other states. these measures are two especially. one is the luxury tax repeal. that luxury tax was imposed about 2 years ago. and has been an unqualified disaster. the theory was that it would hit the rich by saying that anybody who bought a yacht or a boat that cost over $100.000 would have to pay a 10percent tax on the excess amount over $100.000. what has been the effect. the effect has  been to hurt the rich in any fashion at all. the effect has been to devastate the boat building industry. and especially in my state where we build more sailboats or boat hulls than any state in the nation. even more than california. our little state with 1 million people has built more sailboat hulls than any state in the nation. this legislation does  raise money. does  hurt the richif you are out to hurt the rich. all it does is hurt a series of lowincome and middleincome boat builders who are trying to make a living. so. thank goodness this legislation repeals that luxury tax. it also repeals the luxury tax on jewelry. which indirectly affects my state where we are large jewelry producers. but mostly in the socalled costume jewelry end of the line. which is usually considered $50 or less. the second major step that this legislation does is to extend the mortgage revenue bonds. the mortgage revenue bonds are extremely important for lowincome and lowmiddleincome individuals to make their firsttime purchase of a home. so also i mention in closing. it also extends the lowincome housing credit. so there are some good points in this bill. i commend it to my colleagues. i thank the chair. i thank the distinguished ranking member for permitting me this time.
. the bill i am introducing today will provide temporary relief to individuals in rhode island who were required to pay tax on the sale of their principal residence as a result of the states banking crisis. under the internal revenue code. homeowners may defer the payment of tax on the sale of their principle residence by purchasing a new one within 2 years. this 2year requirement can only be extended under specific circumstances. and the irs does  have the authority to waive it to take into consideration extraordinary situations such as occurred in rhode island. many rhode islanders who sold their homes over the last 2 years had placed the cash proceeds from the sale in a rhode island financial institution that was subsequently closed when the gover declared a bank holiday on january 1. 1991. as a result. these individuals could  gain access to their downpayments and thus were unable to purchase a new principal residence within the 2year period required to avoid paying the tax. my bill extends the mal 2year rollover period by the amount of time that their money was frozen in a closed institution. with this additional time. rhode islanders will  be able to take advantage of the tax deferral that would have been available to them had the bank holiday  occurred. without this legislation. rhode islanders who are already victims of my states banking crisis will also be penalized by the 2year rollover* rule. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill so that we can enact it early this year and spare these individuals this unfair penalty.* by mr. roth (for himself. mr wellstone. mr. chafee. and
 clinton included such reductions in his own deficit reduction plan. let me also add that we can go on forever extending the emergency unemployment program. this is the third extension of the program. although it clearly is necessary. we really must get to the heart of this matterthe need to create jobs. one suggestion i have is to repeal the luxury tax on boats. the burden of this tax has  fallen on the rich. as envisioned by its authors. instead. it hit american boatbuilders who have been thrown out of work. in total. the boatbuilding industry has lost about 25.000 to 30.000 jobs as a result of the unwillingness of people to pay this tax. and thus purchase boats. these were good. solid american jobs. jobs are a far more enduring support to our nations ecoy and to its workers than are unemployment benefits.
. the administration realizes the negative impact that their energy tax proposal will have on heating oil consumers. which is why they proposed to delay the imposition of the tax for 1 year. but delaying the tax by 1 year is  good egh. heating oil users are willing to pay their fair share of the deficit reduction burden. but the administrations energy tax proposal requires them to pay more than their fair share. i hope my colleagues will join me in expressing the sense of the senate that the energy tax must treat all energy on an equal basis.
. is the old story. just as the senator from nebraska said. we can all have press releases out in our home states talking about the wonderful things that are in the stimulus package. but there is never one mention that we do  pay for it. it is the old story. we once again increase the deficit of the united states of america by. in this case. $16
he always has some fascinating charts here on the floor. indeed i have seen him with charts showing the evilness of the deficit of the na.tion and how it has gone up over years. and it always made a great impression on me. i was wondering if the senior senator from maryland could tell me how he plans to pay for this program. i may be inent. but it is my understanding that what he wishes is several billion dollars of wonderful programs. but  to be paid for. oh. yes. they ought to be paid for. they are to be paid for by our children. by adding it to the deficit. i k that the senior senator from maryland is an admirer of the chairman of the federal reserve. and as you k here is what he had to say about deficits. the deficits are a corrosive force eating away at the foundations of our ecoy. they are a malignant force in our ecoy. the dangerous erosion. significant deterioration. would the senator- from maryland fill me in on how this is going to be paid for. is this goingto be borrowed.
let me just finish this. if i might. so then in 1991. when we did the surface transportation act. we made changes and said that the socalled minimum allocation would go up to 90 percent. the bentsen formula was 85 percent. this went up to 90 percent. furthermore. it was provided that some of the dollars that came inand here is the point of the senator from floridasome of the dollars came in through discretionary grants. what is a discretionary grant. well. a scenic byway grant is a discretionary grant. if you .enact safety belt laws and motorcycle helmet laws. you get additional money. that is discretionary money. what we said was that all that came in counted for the base and all the dollars also counted toward figuring what the 90 percent is. what the senator from florida wants is that all the dollars count for the base that come in from the discretionary funds. but those dollars do  count when you figure toward what the 90 percent is. that is a bit of legerdemain i personally can follow. i do  understand his rationale. i will also say something that the senator well remembers coming from a big state. as do the two senators from california who are present tonight. when this came up. your predecessors battled just as hard for your states as you are doing . and so a compromise was reached. a -fragile compromise. but etheless a compromise that has endured since 1991. it is written in the act. it did  send everybody away totally satisfied. but it was a deal that had to be arrived at in order to get the legislation passed. everybody had to give something. let me just point out something that perhaps the senator from florida has  stressed. what were some of the things that those big states. if you wouldtexas. california. and floridareceived. they received the following: they received a commitment written into law that the additional amount. the amount above the formula to pull them up to 90 percent. would be protected from any budget constraints or cuts. this is extraordinary. when the amount of money authorized was  appropriated in 1992. you etheless got your money. "100 percent of it. to pull you up to that difference between what you would have gotten under the formula and what you got under this 90 percent socalled minimum allocation. that is something you got. that was a bonus. if you would-
madam president. this is the situation. the basic difference in approach here between the two parties is that the republican party is fully conscious that the federal government . for every dollar it spends. 20 cents is borrowed. 20 cents is being levied upon our children and our grandchildren to pay back. that is a horrible situation. and the republicans are saying egh is egh. are we going to end every bit of deficit spending.  but the time to start is . as the old chinese proverb says: the way to start a long journey is to take the first step. and we hear the democrats say. well. $16 billion is changetwo additional minutes. please. madam president. sixteen billion dollars. we should  even pay any attention to that. and the republicans are saying it is  necessary at this time. the thing is labeled an emergency stimulus package. it is neither an emergency.  is it a stimulus. furthermore. if we wanted. there are a whole series of lovely programs that the distinguished chairman has outlined. but the thing is. he is  willing to pay for it. and if you are  willing to pay for it. then what value are they. do you really want them that much. madam president. think of it. this week. all of us iced a lot of youngsters in the capitol and in the city of washington. i assume most of them are here on spring vacation. and it is these young people who are going to pick up the tab for the profligacy of us. our generationme. the chairman of the appropriations committee. and others. twenty cents of every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed. and i think that is wrong. can we correct it overnight.  but we certainly are deserving of a try to end it. and that is what this debate is all about here today. i thank the chair.
on my time. i still have part of my 2 minutes. president reagan or president bush have sent budgets up here which have involved all- kinds of cuts. including. for instance. in the tva. where we have a very strong proponent. and what was the code word that was used as soon as that budget was delivered here. how well everybody on that side ks. "the budget is dead on arrival. doa." and those were very clever words that they used. meaning that we are  paying any attention to that budget. we are paying attention to the cuts. it is dead on arrival. we are going to go forward with our spending as we want it. think of itthe majority party. we have  had control of the house of representatives since when. 1938. 1943. maybe.
in effect. madam president. this president has submitted. with his most optimistic projections. what is going to happen in 4 years. there will be $1 trillion added to the debt of the nation..that is under his figures.  my figures. your figures. the presidents figures. $1 trillion. that is what they objected to about the reaganbush years. that every 4 years there was s1 trillion added.. in effect. madam president. they are emulating. indeed. probably going to exceed it. because they have very optimistic predictions in their budgets. i thank the chair.
the distinguished chairman of the budget committee uses language that has become popular also and that is he has reduced the deficit by $500 billion. i think he said. . everybody who is listening to this better understand what he is talking about. he is taking a line that might have been here and saying it is going to be here.
the question is as follows: is it  so. despite the legerdemain and the descriptions. that at the end of 4 years under the clinton proposal the debt of the nation will increase by $1 trillion under the presidents figures.
under the chairmans own proposal. the debt of the nation is going to increase $1 trillion. that is the answer. so with all the pillorying they have had of the prior administrations. what that wicked reagan administration did. what that bush administration did. $1 trillion in 4 years. and that is using their figures. madam president.  they say they have presented a budget that is going to do wonderful things. does anybody believe that. they could  even vote against cutting honey price supports. they will  even vote against price supports for honey. and take a look at the record of the distinguished chairman of the budget committee. where is he on these votes. why is he  even willing to cut $16 billion. 316 billion. so. we are in a very. very sad situation. they have the votes to do lots of things. thank goodness they do  have the votes to put through this socalled phony stimulus package. i thank the chair.
madam president. i listened carefully to the discussion by the senator from tennessee. i must say he is bringing a new technique of debating on the floor here. somehow ones rationale and persuasiveness is increased in- direct proportion to volume: the louder you yell. apparently. the more persuasive one is. he has talked as though he has  been in the senate. he came to the senate the year i did. he sat securely in the majority for the past 6 years. all those years he was voting cheerfully for different programs. suddenly. this deficit. the debt of the nation is all the republicans. and it is as though he has never been around.  has his party been in charge of the house of representatives. i do  k where this tremendous power that the republicans seem to have had came from. certainly we were  aware of it.  we have heard the senator from maryland deplore the fact that a majority is  permitted to carry forward with this program. well. the shoe is on the other foot . how well we remember the filibuster that was conducted against the capital gains. i just wonder how the senator from maryland voted on that. i k darn well k how he voted. he voted against cloture. and  that was a little different. perhaps. i do  k how it was different.
. i would like to extend my appreciation to the distinguished majority leader for his work in connection with this unanimousconsent request. which we have just agreed to. this is something that is extremely important to my state. with his enthusiastic guidance and support. i have canvassed every single member on the republican side in connection with this. and i thank my colleagues for  objecting to this request. again. i extend my appreciation to the majority leader. who is deeply interested in this matter himself because of the boatbuilding industry that he has in maine. this. tax that was passed. several years ago has been a total disaster for the boatbuilding industry. it is one of those cases where they went out to get the millionaires. to get the rich. and it rebounded. they did  get the rich. all they did. was get the boatbuilders. the people who manufacture the fiberglass. build the winches. sew the. sails. who make the cords and rigging. it has been devastating to the boatbuilding industry in my state and across the nation. i am delighted. that we have gotten this far. we are  home free yet. obviously the measure has to originate in the house and come over. but i do hope we are all successful in achieving that. especially the majority leader. who has been so helpful.
. after spending nearly 3 weeks considering campaign finance reform legislation. we are about to pass a good bill. as you k. i believe the bill that was first brought before us had several serious problems. that is why i joined with senators jefrords. cohen. durenberger. and mccain to try to solve some of those problems. we set forth nine principles that we believed should be included in any package that is labeled campaign reform. let me take a moment to review the nine points: we were successful in our effort to ban. or at least to limit to $1.000. contributions from political action committees. we insisted that the same rules must apply to both the house and the senate. to accomplish this we made certain that the restrictions on contributions from pacs are applied to both bodies. similarly. we have made restrictions on the use of the frank during election years. the same in both the house and senate. we have solved the very difficult and complex issue of soft money. . all money that is spent to influence the outcome of federal elections will be reported to the federal elections commission [fec]. we were able to go one step further and to require advance ice to candidates when these softmoney activities were going to occur and give the candidates who would be affected some recourse to respond. unfortunately we were  able to get agreement on the amendment offered by senators cohen and domemc that would require candidates to raise the bulk of their funds from instate contributions. perhaps that is an issue that will have better success in the house. we were successful in prohibiting outofstate fundraising except during the 2 years prior to a candidates election. this should reduce the amount of time that is taken up by fundraising activities. our amendment on severability was  acceptable to the majority. but it is my hope that in conference the ambiguities. that exist in the current bill will be worked out. senator mccains amendment to limit the amount of money that can be repaid to a candidate who makes loans to his or her own campaign was  accepted. but an amendment by senator wellstone to limit the amount of money a candidate can contribute. to his or her own campaign. to $25.000 may help to address that point. the durenbergerexon amendment allowed us to avoid public financing except under the most restricted circumstances. finally. the durenbergerexon amendment includes a revenue source. the tax on complying campaign committees. all in all. i would say that we started with a bill that failed to address some of the major problems with our current system of campaign financing and then asked the taxpayers to pick up the check. . we have legislation that limits the influence of special interest groups. closes the loopholes that allowed undisclosed and unregulated money to flow into the system. apply the same set of rules to candidates for both the house and the senate. encourage us to do our fundrasing at home. and minimizes the cost to taxpayers. finally. it is my hope that we will be able to come to some resolution on the issue of changing the composition of the federal election commission that does  favor one party over aher. this is a critical issue for many of my colleagues. and i believe a valid one. certainly. the. fec should be able to act decisively in order fairly to enforce federal campaign laws. however. i do  believe that either of the major political parties should be made the driving force for deciding fec cases. i hope that the house of representatives takes our efforts here seriously. if a bill comes back to use from conference that falls to include the provisions that we have agreed to here. it would be highly unlikely that i would support the conference report.
my question to the distinguished senator of the finance committee is. taking all his assumptions. when he is through. if this bill should pass. will  the debt of the nation increase 1 trillion in the next 4 years.
madam president. i am pleased with the substitute national service bill which has emerged from this debate. i want to commend eli segal of the white houseas well as senator kennedyfor their willingness to work out this compromise. i also want to thank senator kassebaum for her tireless efforts to develop a more realistic bill than the one which came out of committee. the committeereported bill simply "tried to do too much too fast." as my friend from kansas so aptly pointed out during the debate. that bill would have authorized $4 billion within the first 3 years. and closer to $10 billion over 5 years. while these authorizations sound greatparticularly to the young advocates of national servicethey create false expectations. the compromise level of $1.5 billion over 3 years is far superior in light of the fiscal facts. do any of us honestly believe that appropriations for this bill of $10 billion were realistic given the constraints in discretionary spending we face. the spending caps included in the budget resolution provide for almost growth over the next 5 years-- even for inflation. so. where would this money come from. we all k the competition for discretionary dollars in the appropriations process is getting tougher every year. once enacted. national service will have to compete with other popular programs for funding within the hudva subcommittee: environmental protection. lowincome housing. veterans hospitals. scientific research. and nasa to name a few. thus. with such ambitious authorization levels. appropriations of the originally proposed magnitude would never have been achieved. the committeereported bill also begged the question of whether or  we could create 25.000 new.service positions in fiscal year 1994. and as many as 150.000 by 1997. since the new fiscal year begins in just 2 months and the corporation for national and community service does  yet exist. reaching the 25.000 level in year one would have been quite a challenge. to achieve that level would have required a placement rate of approximately 2.100 new entrants per month. i would remind my colleagues that currently in our whole u.s. government there are only 20.000 positions of this type. these include approximately 3.300 for vista and 5.500 for the peace corps. adding 25.000 new positions on top of these would have more than doubled the size of existing programs. which have taken years to put in place. if that sounds daunting. imagine trying to reach the 150.000 level envisioned by 1997 under the committeereported bill. that kind of expansion would have necessitated a placement rate of 12.500 per month. while the compromise is  perfect. it is a far more realistic and responsible approach than the original bill. i am satisfied that authorizations of $300 million. $500 million. and $700 million over the next 3 fiscal years will provide a more durable. sustainable foundation for the future of national service than the overly ambitious plan that came from committee. i hope that the bill which emerges from conference with the house is  more grandiose than the one the senate has produced. in conclusion. madam president. i just would like to clarify one thing. while some have sought to label the extended debate. which produced this compromise. a filibusterthat is a miser. there are two kinds of debate in this body: the endless varietythe true filibusterdesigned to kill legislationand the constructive variety which is aimed at fostering negotiation and improving legislation. the latter is what happened here. and i think we can all be proud of the result.
i ask the distinguished senator from missouri. are we  on a course here that really makes a complete joke out of the byrd rule. all one has to do is to take a provision that makes a major change in the law. that has hing to do with finances. either revenue or expenditures. for the federal government. and then dream up some conjectural figure that affects the spending of the government in some way. tack that in there and say we have  complied with the byrd rule. for example. i suppose somebody could stick into a reconciliation measure statehood for the district of columbia and say. oh. it is going to affect expenditures. and so thus we have opened the way for reconciliation to include all forms of massive changes in the law for the u.s. government and actually everything goes through in an expedited fashion. limited debate. filibuster. we are duplicative of the house of representatives. am i correct in that.
could i ask one more question of the senator. am i correct in that we are  dscussing the merits of the proposal. whether it is good or bad. what we are discussing is the procedural situation here. where we can just make major changes in laws of the united states under the guise of reconciliation. which is to deal with the federal budget and expenditures. and instead we are changing laws of the country.
madam president. i strongly believe that this legislation is bad for our country. we. in our nation. are in what we might call a fragile recovery.- unemployment. nationally. is at 7 percent. and in my state it is over 8 percent. many of our nations largest employers are  adding employees but indeed are cutting employment: ibm. 35.000 people to go. procter & gamble. 13.000 people to go. westinghouse. 7.500 people being cut. we are just  creating egh new jobs in our country. this is a tremendous tragedy for millions of our citizens. what they want is jobs for themselves and jobs for their families. this bill before us this evening. regrettably. is a jobs killer. when times are bad. it is  the occasion to impose stiff new taxes on our ecoy. it is all well and good -for the administration to pour out a torrent of information saying this bill will only tax the rich. but that glosses over the fact that unincorporated businesses. larger sole proprietorships. subchapter s corporations. which are the jobcreating engines in our society. will see their taxes leap from 31 percent to as high as 44 percent. you might say that from 31 percent to 44 percent is a 13 percent increase.  at all. that is a 42 percent increase. furthermore. it is retroactive to january 1 of this year. obviously. the last thing that these businesses are going to be doing is to plan on hiring more people. much has been made of the cuts in spending in this bill. but nearly all of these cuts come in 1997 and 19984 and 5 years from . nearly all of these cuts are from medicare providers--on the doctors. $23 billion. on the hospitals. $23 billion. these may represent savings to the u.s. government. but what will the hospitals do to make up for the lost income from the medicare fund. hospitals are  wallowing in wealth. certainly in my state they are . they can make deep cuts in the wages of their employees. so what will they do. they will increase the charges to the other patients. those whose insurance is paid for by individuals or by their employers. this is what we call cost shifting. thus. the insurance costs for these businesses will rise inelitably. leaving less money for the businesses to modernize their plants. to become more competitive and to hire more people. the best thing that could happen. . tonight is for this measure to be defeated. and we start all over again. with republicans being invited to the table. the extremes of both parties would  be totally happy. but the result would be a measure with some new or additional taxes. but  of the magnitude of this bill. the cuts and savings would be considerably greater than we  have before us. and the difficult decisions that neither party can make alone would be jointly made. and our nation would be the winner. i thank the chair.
. if you want to politi- ering process. and that it might serve cize the intelligence budget. invite un- some useful purpose for them as far as authorized disclosures. or have a mean- their being able to relate to americas ingless or even misleading public de- strategic advantage or disadvantage. bate about intelligence spending. then for that reason. i have  advocated you should vote for this amendment. the specifics. i am frank to say that i thats all that revealing the top line am  sure that i could  be perfigures can produce. on the other hand. suaded that there would be an advanif you believe that the intelligence. tage to going further than this amendarmed services and appropriations pan- ment. els do their jobs properly. and provide but this amendment really goes just effective oversight. and if you believe the very slightest amount. it merely that intelligence. like foreign policy. says that it is the sense of the congress should  be a partisan issue. you that this one number should. be made should oppose this amendment. public. indeed. i want to ask the senator it is a fact that we have already enfrom ohio a couple of questions. if i acted this. we passed this very same might. thing last year and the year before. if the objective is greater openness so saying that it is the sense of the conthe public can better understand the gress that in 1993 the numbers should intelligence budget. why do you only be made public. reveal the total budget figure. why  this does  even say that. it does get into the details of each of the agen-  say the 1993 figure should be made cies. for example. and why  release public. but it indicates that the conthe budget figures for specific satellite gress has  backed off its commitprograms. it seems to me. then. one ment to the concept that this number can compare the budgets of agencies a should be made public. and b and c. and what the various ca- as i said before in offering the pabilities are of the overhead pro- amendment. i am very proud of the grams. that is the way to really make fact that just about every former sense out of this. whereas. if you just chairperson and vice chairperson. with argue about an overall fixed sum. intel- one or two exceptions. are cosponsors ligence costs x billions of dollars. so of this amendment.. what. i am curious. will the senator the presiding officer. the senhelp me on that. ator from rhode island.
i appreciate that from spend the money on. the senator. i have a limited amount when you go out to buy a car. you of time. i did ask a question. and he see what you are going to get for your was very kind to respond. but i am money. what kind of a car is it. is it caught in the situation where i have to some kind of clunker. or does it have receive very brief answers--unless. of all these marvelous things with the upholstery that smells like leather. and all those other wonderful options. that is what you find out when you are going out to buy a car. you just do  work with a lump sum. it seems to me that all that can come of the senators amendment. if approved. is that with the details of the budget remaining secret. as it does under his amendment. it only frustrates the public. which wants to find out more about how the money is spent. some say that there have already been leaks regarding some of our satellites. for example. which are very expensive. and perhaps by disclosing the lump sum and then getting down into more detail. we would be able to come on to this floor and discuss the capabilities of the various intelligence satellites. but that in itself i believe would be a greatmistake. you might say. well. here we are. we are all moving around in the dark. that just is  so. we have six committees in the congress. three in each body. that have the capability of king every single detail of the intelligence budget. the appropriations committee. the intelligence committee. and the armed services committee. any senator on those committees or any senator. really. in the senate who wants to k the details of the budget of the intelligence agency. all he has to do is go find out. the difference is. are we going to discuss it here on the floor and reveal it entirely to the public. i think that would be a great mistake. you might say oh. well. here else do we keep anything a. secret. that just is  so. we all k that the fbi records. concerning inees that come up to us are  made public. when we get a inee come before us. there is an fbi report on that individual. that is  made public. that is kept secret. think of it. that wicked word "secret" is used. but the facts are that for good reason the public expects us to protect sensitive information. i believe if you want to politicize the intelligence budget. if you want to invite unauthorized disclosures. if you want to have misleading or meaningless public debate about intelligence spending. then go ahead and vote for this amendment. i think it would be a mistake. i hope the senate will reject the amendment of the senator from ohio. i thank the chair. the "presiding officer
. i have some questions about this legislation. and i would like to ask my distinguished colleague. the senator from missouri. to see if i understand his bill correctly. as i understand the billand i am open to correction on this--what it does is it provides that over the course of 2 years. that is fiscal year 1995. which starts on october 1. and fiscal year 1996. that the bill authorizes some $2.8 billion of additional spending. am i correct in that. i ask the senator.
i k that there is a in the- current. year. money redifference between authorization and quested in the budget by the adminisappropriation. but clearly. the com- tration. we start off with $50 million mittee has  authorized this without. for the next year and $50 million behoping that it will be appropriated. yond that. that can be only my conclusion. additional activities. zero for. the my second question is: is there a current year.. zero requested by the method of paying for this in the legis- president. $14 million. and then $19 lation. million beyond that. in other words. i can only assume and then. wind energy and environthat probably the president. in his adtewn nryadevrn mental construction. zero. zero.. and budget request. has found some way of then $6 million. national techogy paying for it or adding it to the deficit. info service. that is zero in the current how aboutthe difference. iher words. the difference here is some $400 year. requested by the president some million. is there a way of paying for $18 million. and up it goes to $20 mlthat in here. lion. new nfs centersi presume that
well. i am rather sensitive on this subject. because during the debate over the balanced budget amendment. the supporters of the amendment were sharply criticized for offering what was a placebo instead of the hard medicine needed to reduce the deficit. in other words. our desire to reduce the deficit through the constitutional amendment was labeled. as a phony because the amendment did  state how the budget would be balanced. we did  detail that.  here we are. 10 days later on the floor- with a bill. legislation.. that is similarly phony. it authorizes $2.8 billion in .new spending but does  tell us how it is to be paid for. suppose it did tell us how it was -to be paid for: cuts. or savings in other programs. is it immoral to take some savings that are there and put them toward the deficit. instead of immediately grabbing them to spend in an.other program. this program for example. as i understand the budget deficit in the current fiscal year. it is anticipated to .be $170 billion. am i correct. that is the latest figure i have. the budget deficit for this current fiscal year ending in the end of september is $170 billion.
that is the latest- figure that they have. . what does that mean. when we run a budget deficit like that. by the way. the deficit in the following year is in the billions. likewise. i am sure for 1995. when we are going to embark on this program with some $400 million more than this requests in its authorization for the current year. that means we are going to send the bill to our children. it is all well and good to give sturdy speeches out here about doing something about the deficit. having courage. but here we start right off with a measure that spends $2.8 billion ito take care of big business. to a considerable degree. and send the bill to our children. - . i think that is wrong. can nice arguments be made in favor of this spending. of course they .can be made. just like there is  one of us who could  be here on the floor and dream up 100 programs that are  only good for our nation but we .can classify as investments. that key word: "investment." butin the final analysis we are sending the bill to our children. i think it is wrong. i hope this measure will be defeated.
i appreciate that. perhaps while the senator is up he can give me the truth in where i erred in the figures i have here. am i in error in saying that the total appropriation for these activities were $526 million in the current fiscal year. am i in error there.
thank you. . the bill before us today addresses two major concerns to the american people. first. the need for a strong ecoy. we all want that and we think we can have a strong ecoy and still have a clean environment. as the chairman mentioned in his opening remarks. the second point echoes that and that is to have a healthy environment. we want to pass on this country of ours in better shape. and hopefully the world likewise. in better shape than we found it from an environmental point of view. inative environmental techogies we believe will save america millions in tax dollars. we believe it will increase exports. because the demand for these techogies across the world in the developed nations and. indeed. in the underdeveloped nations to help wrestle with these problems they have and how to solve them creates a tremendous opportunity for exports from this country when we have developed the techogy here. we believe it will help create jobs and help ensure the protection of our limited natural resources. the question certainly is  whether we need an environmental strategy but how will it be structured and implemented. we believe that s. 978 provides. the framework for going forward on this. i urge my colleagues to support.this legislation.
. today. we approved the budget for fiscal year 1995 for the legislative branch of government. we have appropriated $2.4 billion to operate congress. the general accounting office. the government printing office. the library of congress. the botanic gardens. the congressional budget office. the architect of the capitol. and the office of techogy assessment. on its face. this bill is a 4.1percent increase over the fiscal year 1994 appropriation. but it is important to e the steps that were taken by the senate to continue our efforts to limit spending. the fiscal year 1995 appropriation for the senate is $5.8 million less than last year. that is a reduction of 1.3 percent. the senate is the only account within this appropriations bill that has gone down.. i am especially pleased that we have eliminated funding for unsolicited. franked mass mailings. this action alone allowed us to reduce our spending by $5 million. of course. senators still will be able to answer inquires from constituents and provide them with updates on matters in which they have expressed concern. but we have eided the practice of papering our states with socalled postal patron newsletters that too often find their way. unread. into trash bins. perhaps. the house will follow the senates lead by taking similar steps next year. in this bill. the senate takes an important step toward increasing accountability. every year beginning in 1995. the published report by the secretary of the senate will contain a statement of each senators office allotment. expenditures. and yearend balance. our constituents will be able to see for themselves how we use our official funds. there are two programs that have received increases that i wholeheartedly support. first. the library of congress national library service program for the blind and physically handicapped has received an increase of $2.3 million. the national library service provides recordings of books and magazines on cassettes and discs. as well as equipment to play the recordings. to individuals with disabilities that impede their access to printed material. this is an extremely important and valuable service. the additional funds will be used to repair and update the playback equipment. . second. $1.5 million was restored in the conference report to. permit the government printing office to complete its work on providing government- information to federal depository libraries through electronic online services. the gpo access system will provide direct. online access to federal register. i am pleased that the senate has continued its efforts to keep spending down. i believe that more can and should be done to limit spending on the legislative branch and hope that next year. the house will follow the senates example and make a greater effort to cut unnecessary spending on itself.
 clinton said he wanted to make sure that "the voice of the people is heard over the voice of the special interests." but if the democratic compromise had been agreed to. the voice of the people would have been little more than a whisper compared with that of special interests. the socalled compromise would have permitted pacs to contribute up to $6.000 per candidate for federal office. some might say thats a good start. down from $10.000. according to an article that appeared in the washington post on june 13. 1994. "the average pac donation to a candidate in the 1992 elections was only about $1.600. according to an analysis of federal election commission records. the median. donation was $1.000. and the most common donation was $500." in other words. reducing the pac limit to $6.000 would have absolutely affect on reducing special interest influence on the election process. the senate has made great strides in eliminating the incumbent advantage provided by the frank. the senatepassed bill included my amendment to prohibit unsolicited. franked mass mailings during a senators election year. ana the legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995 eliminates the use of the frank for all unsolicited. mass mailings other than town meeting ices. the democratic leaderships compromise did hing to end excessive election year franking in the house. an editorial that appeared in roll call on september 22.- indicated that "use of the frank by house members surged l~y 33 percent in the first half of 1994 over 1993. obviously because this is an election year." the editorial went on to say that "members facing tough reelection races or trying to move on to a new office do so by sending out gobs of free mail." certainly. we should be able to erase this blatant incumbent advantage. i hope that when -we address this troubling issue in the next congress. the house will be more forthright in its. efforts.
 that it establishes for congress. .the administration has to submit a balanced budget. i am grateful that the sponsors have  sought to include a threefifths majority requirement for raising revenue. that was discussed. you have to have 60 votes to increase taxes. that was rejected by the house. and rightfully so. that provision would be disastrous for this country because it would significantly hamper our ability to govern. facing a deficit. congress would in all likelihood be forced to cut spending rather than to raise revenue because the latterto raise revenuerequires 60 votes. i support spending cuts over tax increases but feel it would be unwise totilt the playing field against raising revenue. in other words. you need 60 votes to increase taxes but you only need 51 votes to cut spending. i would  support this amendment if it had the threefifths majority for raising revenue. but fortunately. it is  in there. the amendment includes a process whereby the requirements can be waived by a simple majority for any year in which the country is in war or when the united states is engaged in a military conflict. i think these are legitimate circumstances. in section 7 of the amendment. it states that the total receipts. all receipts. of the u.s. government except those derived from borrowing and total outlays should include outlays for the u.s. government except those for the repayment of debt principal. what this means is that every dollar that comes in to the treasury and every dollar that goes out of the treasury will be counted in determining whether the budget is balanced. again. this makes sense. this is the way we run our families. we count the dollars that come in and the dollars that go out. except for borrowing. obviously. much of the efforts to derail this resolution has centered on excluding certain programs from the balanced budget amendment. this all started in the judiciary committee when an effort was made to exclude social security. i find this inconceivable. why would wc adopt as part of the constitution an exclusion for social security or any .other aspect of the federal budget. i am for protecting the fiscal soundness of the social security system. but it is absurd to exempt a program that represents 29 percent of all federal receipts and 22 percent of all outlays. a big chunk of the budget would be disregarded in all of this process. if that had been adopted. thank goodness. it was rejected. exempting social security receipts would provide a perverse incentive for future congresses to shift social security revenues to the general fund. this should be very attractive since the program currently collects more in revenue than it pays out in benefits. but this would undermine the actuarial balance of the social security trust fund. and would certainly require draconian changes in the future in order to stave off bankruptcy when the baby boomers retire. critics of the balanced budget amendment have argued that it is a sham. that it avoids. as i mentioned previously. the tough choices required to balance the budget. i disagree. what this represents is the first and most important step in a long and difficult journey to fiscal responsibility. it symbolizes the tide has finally changed. we are committed to living within our means. and we are willing to embody that principle in the basic document of the nation. on which the foundation of all our government rests. namely. the constitution. other fiscal disciplines we have enacted. while they are importantand i voted for every single one themhave  done the job. the grammrudmanhollings deficit control laws. the firewalls. the discretionary spending caps. the payasyougo rulesall of these we have tried. as i say. i voted for every single one of them. and have supported them when they have attempted to be amended. but they failed to break the attractive lure of deficit spending. opponents have also argued we should  pass a balanced budget amendment until the supporters of it outline specifically how we reach that goal. this is sense. in my judgment. it is like a doctor saying you have to lose 40 pounds. "i am  going to lose 40 pounds until you tell me specifically how i am going to do it." well. the objective is. if you want to keep your health. you had better lose that 40 pounds. there are a variety of ways you can do it. you can work those out yourself. as long as you get there. to lose the 40 pounds. you can go on a diet. you can eat less. you can go through health plans. you can exercise more. you can try different approaches. but the end result is you have to get there. that is what we have said. the socalled righttok amendment to the resolution before us really is a smokescreen thrown up by those who had intention of supporting this proposal. whether or  we had outlined the specifics as to how we are going to get there. the fact is. there is agreement upon the path to reach a balanced budget. the path that i would subscribe to is likely different from the path that others would subscribe to. any plan will be the product of numerous compromises and the give and take of a mal political process. all that is going to take place once the requirement is established. to those who do  support the resolution before us. the question is: what would you do. how would you get there. are you content with the current situation where the annual deficits exceed $200 billion. and in the foreseeable future going up greater than that. ten years from . it will be $451 billion. as i said. do people believe we can put this problem off for aher day. that somehow it is going to get easier. do you believe we are improving our childrens future by dropping this massive debt in their laps. every previous effort to balance the budget without an amendment to the constitution has been a failure. as i mentioned. why has that been the case. the answer is simple. once the targets become too difficult to meet. congress changes the law or budgets. this resolution makes it difficult for us to avoid our responsibilities. the task is monumental. but the consequences for our failure are far worse. if this amendment is defeated. the ones who will be hurt the most are future generations of this country. so for our childrens and our grandchildrens sake. and for those of future generations. i fervently hope that this balanced budget amendment is approved here. and approved in the states likewise. i thank the chair.
. every previous effort to balance the budget without an amendment to the constitutionthat is. by statutehas failed to achieve that goal. why has that been the case. the answer is simple. once the targets become too difficult to meet. we simply changed the law. this resolution makes it difficult for us to avoid our responsibility. the task is monumental. but the consequences for our failure are far worse. if this amendment is defeated. the ones who will be hurt the most are the future generations of our nation.
 this new authority would undermine the "power of the purse". delegated to the legislative branch under the constitution. while this concern maybe overstated. there is questionthis is a bitter pill for the congress to swallow. but its a recognition that the legislative branch can put its fiscal house in order. and that additional checks are needed. wisely. the dole amendment includes a 4year sunset provision. so that we are  committing ourselves to an irreversible course of action. in closing. i want to commend the majority leader. senator dole. as well .as senators mccain and domenici for working together to develop the dole substitute to s. 4. i strongly support this amendment and hope that the senate will adopt this measure with a substantial bipartisan vote.
. here is the problem i find: we have a terrible deficit of $200 billion which every objective group says will rise to over $300 billion and close to $400 billion by the end of the century. the republicans have come up with a program that reaches a balanced budget  next year.  the year after. but 7 years away. which seems to me that would be a reasonable timetable to arrive at a situation where we are longer sending the bills to our children. . the proposal that has emerged from the republican budget committee has many harsh provisions to it. when we are reducing expenditures there are going to be difficulties. as we all recognize and as the senator has ably pointed out. it affects this. affects that. affects things i am interested in. that the senator is interested in. that the presiding officer is interested in. there is  one that will  find things we do  like. the question is. what is the alternative. i do  believe the answer is to say stop giving those tax cuts to rich people. because in the domenici budget there are tax cuts. never mind the rich people. there are tax cuts at all. so he has presented a budget which i k we will all find terribly challenging and difficult and dissatisfying. what is the alternative. maybe the answer is to increase taxes. i do  believe that we can continue on the path we are. which consists of sending the bills to our children. we live high on the hog. and send the bill to our children and grandchildren. i think that is immoral. if we do  like the proposal. what is a better one. i am  trying to put the senator on the spot.
i appreciate the suggestions that the senator from: massachusetts made. tax expenditures--i suppose he is talking about. first of all. a whole series of things. whether we should be providing pensions. deductible pensions. or whether we are talking about in the tax expenditures. whether he is talking about depreciation. i do  find those objectionable. but never mind. it seems to me it would behoove everyone to come up with -plans. that is. if the senator and the administration do  like the republican proposal for doing something about this balanced budget by the year 2002. which is a very reasonable goal to reach. we have wars. times are relatively good. inflation is low. unemployment is low. relatively low. and this is the time to gun for this balanced budget amendment. balanced budget situation. but the administration has  done that. it has chosen  to do that. all right. how about the democratic senators doing it themselves. i would be interested to see what they come up with. because this is very. very difficult. and every step that we take. we being the republicans who have come up with this balanced budget. we are going to be attacked. and there are going to be wonderful things to attack us on. but at least we are trying to get there. i think as a part of a sense of responsibility. if you want to call -it that. that itwould be wise. it would be helpful if others came up with their approach. maybe you can do it better than we can do it. if so. three cheers. and let us hear your ideas.
. i ask unanimous consent that the subcommittee on readiness of the committee on armed services be authorized to meet at 9 a.m. on tuesday. may 16. 1995. in open session. to receive testimony on department of defense fi. nancial management in review of s. 727. the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996. and the future years defense program.
. i just hope this budget before us will receive the support from every single senator when we vote on it tomorrow aftern. again. i congratulate the distinguished senator from maine and the distinguished senator from michigan for the excellent amendment which they have submitted.
. i want to commend the distinguished senator from illis for the presentation he made. and for the effort he is making to cover pregnant women and children. i certainly will look at the legislation he has presented. i think it is a great help in this ongoing debate that we are having that the senator has stepped forward with this legislation. which seems to me to hold a lot of promise. as he mentioned. always the funding part is difficult. but. etheless. i agree with the source of funding from the increased tax on cigarettes. i am  sure everybody else will enthusiastically embrace it. but i think the senator mentioned rhode island and
. i think the distinguished ranking member of the finance committee made some good points. as has everybody else here today. this is a very commendable amendment. although it is an amendment we have  had a chance to consider in the finance committee. it is a matter that will come before us when we are dealing with the tax provisions that we are surely going to get to later this year. and so. therefore. i am prepared to accept the amendment.
. i want to correct a few inaccuracies that were in the statement of the distinguished senator from connecticut. i am confident that these were unintentional. but they were delivered with considerable vigor so i think i might take this opportunity to rebut then. the senator from connecticut said  one penny from these savings in medicare go into the trust fund. that just plain is  so. every single nickel. every single penny saved under the part a. the reduction in the payments to the hospitals. the reductions in the payments to the other providers. the providers dealing with the hospitals side. all go into what is kn as the hospital insurance fund. or part a. every single pennyi am  sure of the exact amount in billions of dollars. but of the total $270 billion. a very substantial. i will  say half. but i suspect close to half will go into that part a hospital insurance trust fund. when the senator says with all the vigor he can muster that e of that is going into the trust fund. that just plain is  right. . second. the senator says 51 percent of the tax cuts are going to the rich. that is a very interesting statement because in the senate we do  have any idea what the tax cuts are going to be. all that we have done in the senate is to say that up to $240 billion of tax cuts can take place. that means there could be zero. there could be $1 or there could be $240 billion. one has said so farthe finance committee that deals with the tax cuts has  come up with any proposals dealing with what the tax cuts will be. some say they want $500 credit for every child. . if that is adopted. one is suggesting that 51 percent of that is going to the rich people. every taxpayer. even taxpayers who pay $501 will get a $500 credit. so they pay $1 in taxes. indeed. the person who pays less thai that. i presume would  only get refund but get some kind of an incom( tax credit in addition to the regulai $500 credit. who ks what we will adopt king how legislative bodies are. suspect that we will go right up to th $240 billion. one has decided tha yet. meetings of the finance committee have taken place in connectior with taxes. -decisions have beer made. it is total sense to say that 51 percent of the tax cut is going to the rich under any senate plan.
. the reconciliation bill contains a provision which would put the hyde language permanently into law. this is the first time that this has been done. the hyde language has always appeared in annual appropriations bills which are open to modification. this provision. subsection 2123(g) of the social security act. as added by section 7191(a) in the reconciliation measure. does  produce a change in outlays or revenues and is  necessary to implement a provision that does change outlays or revenues. i. therefore. raise a point of order under section 313(b)(1)(a) of the budget act against that provision.
. we must take bold steps . we can continue to pile ever greater debt burdens on our children and grandchildren. thank goodness we finally have a legislative proposal that will reverse this ruis course.
 that is what you call a syllogism. does he believe that the premium should  be 31.5 percent. suddenly we get talking about tax breaks for the rich. there is tax break for the rich provided in this legislation. what we are saying is- .
i hope the result which emerges from negotiations on the welfare part of the balanced budget act will be closer to the senate bill. the conference agreement appears to depart significantly from the senate bill in areas such as foster care and childrens supplemental security income. for example. in addition. it is unrea-" sonably restrictive with respect to the treatment of legal immigrants. which i find quite troubling and unacceptable. we should bite the bullet and correct the consumer price index. which is a measure of inflation used to compute costofliving adjustments for social security benefits. as well as to conform federal tax brackets with inflationary changes. there is growing bipartisan consensus within congress. and among ecoists. that the cpi overstates inflation. even a modest correction of fivetenths of 1 percent would reduce outlays by about $122 billion over 7 years. affecting only a $4 or $5 reduction in the increase the average beneficiary would receive. the approaches i have outlined will help the respective parties reach an agreement to balance the budget by providing the flexibility needed to reduce the reliance on savings from medicaid and other programs serving the needy. particularly those serving poor children. . in conclusion. this legislation presents us with a tremendous opportunity to fulfill our responsibilities to put our fiscal house in order. i urge passage of this legislation so that we can move on to direct negotiations with the white house toward a final budget agreement. i thank the chair and the manager.
i thank the chair. i want to return to the balanced budget amendment discussions that we have had here previously. i listened to some of the discourse that took place here. i thought there was a lot of common sense here on the floor. the senator from georgia spoke. the senator from nevada. the two senators from nebraska and others. i thought what was said here gives us ground for arriving at a very reasonable compromise in the days ahead. clearly. the president will veto the balanced budget amendment. we all accept that. the question is. where do we 4go from here. . i think we have the ground here. from the discussions i have heard on the floor. for arriving at a reasonable compromise. to get any compromise. people have got to go in with a certain amount of flexibility. if the republicans say " a nickel reduction in the tax cut that we have provided." or if the democrats say "hing doing on the year 2002. hing doing there." if each of us get dug in. we will  get anywhere. i think we have the basis here fdr a reasonable compromise. i hope the administration and the negotiators from the house and the senate would pay attention to the suggestions made here on the floor today.
there is question that that is right. i rmust say as we start on this. if i could use a word of caution. i hope that we would avoid the word "morality" here. that one side is moral and the other side is immoral. i do  want to pursue this too far. but i think all of us have to watch our rhetoricme. us on this side. all of us in this chamberif we are going to arrive at a satisfactory resolution of these very difficult problems. the answer to the question. have a tax cut to help those who most need itsure. of course. we recognize those who most need it are  paying much of a tax to start with. so how much a reduction would be of assistance to those individuals. i do  k. * i think we also have to recognizeas i said before. i am  for the tax cut. but there are those who feel very. very deeply about it. particularly in the other body. that does  mean that we can back off from the size of the tax cut that was proposed. if the senator from massachusetts has some suggestions on how we could reduce the tax cut and make it directed more toward the group he was suggesting. i think that sounds sensible to me.
first of all. i thank the senator from nevada for permitting us to go ahead of him. that was very gracious. this morning. a bipartisan group of senators--19 in allunveiled a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. using cbo. congressional budget office. numbers. the group. which senator breaux and i had convened several weeks agoactually. we had our first meeting in octoberincludes. as i say. so far. 19 senators. that is without going out and seeking new members. it is just those who have come to us and want to join in this effort. we are all united in this belief. . i am delighted to be joined here on the floor with the distinguished senator from louisiana. who was absolutely crucial in all these negotiations that we had
. i thank the senior senator from pennsylvania for his kind remarks and for the wonderful work and help which he has given us on this. i would like to turn back. if i might. to the senator from louisiana because both of us have encountered. as i have previously mentioned. objections to specifics here. but this is  exactly unkn territory. let me suggest to the senator from louisiana that a bill went through this body which had high tax cuts. it did  have the corrections to it in the cpi. and that bill. as i reall. did  get enacted into law. in other words. one approach was tried which many people here say. "oh. we need more taxes. we do  like this. you only have $130 billion in taxes. you ought to have $245 billion." ok. we tried that. am i correct in saying that.
so when those others say do it this way or do it that way. there is other train leaving the station that i am aware of that is going to reach the terminal point successfully. in other words. the president has indicated that. and the democratic leadership has indicated that they do  want high tax cuts. am i correct in that.
i think the answer to this is that people really do  want to get into trying to solve these dramatic- problems that are out there in connection with the entitlements. the word "entitlement" is one we toss around here. but what are entitlements. entitlements are. principally. social security. but they are also medicare. medicaid. and welfare. we believeand it is  just us but every serious student of the deficit of this nation and the direction we are going has said soit is essential to get the expenditures in these entitlement programs under control or there just plain will  be money to pay for them in the future years. so when we began looking into this in the finance committee. as the senator from louisiana indicated. chairman alan greenspan of the federal reserve came and testified before us and he said you should look - into the consumer price index. and whether it is accurately stated. it was his view. which was corroborated by further studies. that the consumer price index is overstated and the consumer price index is the basis on which the cost of living adjustments are computed for social security. for pensions. indeed. for the tax code. so we looked into this further. as the senator said. we set up a commission to look into what is the accurate consumer price index. as the senator said. the preliminary report has come back saying that as currently computed it is overstated somewhere between. on the low side 0.7 percent. on the high side 2 percent. so we looked at that. here is 2 percent way up here. 0.7 percent here. we said we will  go as high as either of those figures. we will only make an adjustment of. 0.5 percent. from the consumer price index. actually. we would make really tremendous savings if we. for example. took the 2 percent.
. i agree with the senator from louisiana that this step is simply the right thing to do. all we are doing is saying. let the consumer price index be accurately stated. that is what we have chosen to do here. some have labeled that a very courageous step. we did  look on it that way. we think of it as the logical step to take to state the cpi more accurately. likewise. there is. as the senator from louisiana so aptly stated. a tremendous benefit to doing that. otherwise. unless we do it. the social security system is going to go under water. i see the senator from washington here. and i am glad to hear his comments.
. it is strictly an equity matter. if you will. it is strictly a public health matter. likewise. we think it is worthwhile for illegal aliens to get proper prenatal care. and if we think that is true for illegal aliens. certainly it ought to be true for legal aliens. this is  a budget buster. this is  going to drive the national debt through the sky. these are very narrow. very limited matters. far more limited than any of those that have been brought up in past amendments. this is  replaying an old record. this is a very. very defined group of benefits. and i hope that the floor managers will accept it. i reserve the remainder of my time.
. in the face of growing domestic water shortages. as well as strategic international concerns. this legislation is designed to increase the u.s. commitment to developing more ecoical desalinization techogy. s. 811. as reported. authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 1997 for the basic research and development at the interior department. $7.5 million is authorized for this purpose in each of fiscal years 1998 through 2001. for a 5year total of $35 million. for the facility development program. $40 million is authorized for fiscal years 1997 through 2001. i e that the total authorization for appropriations in this bill is $20 million less than the $95 million provided in the bill as introduced. i thank senator simon and the others who support this bill for working with us to reduce the authorization levels. based upon the very limited amount of discretionary funding that will be available over the next 5 to 7 years. we have choice but to do more with less in this area.
the arguments. i believe. have been very. very forcefully set forth this evening by the speakers on our side. democrats and republicans. what are we talking about. we are talking as a bipartisan group that something has to be done about the deficit of this nation or future generations are going to be in terrible trouble. we heard the statistics from the senator from south dakota in connection with this. and others likewise who talked about what social security is going to look like or medicare or the other entitlement programs unless in some fashion we get control. this budget that we are presenting does that. this budget  only balances itself in the 7 years. but in the outyears. that is where the tremendous savings are. so i commend my colleagues to come forward and join us. as the presiding officer in his remarks pointed out. there are those who are saying. "we would be with you. but were  sure you have egh votes." if we spent all our time going only with those who have a majority. we would  stand for anything. we are  sent down here as weather vanes to go where the majority is. we are sent down here. it seems to me.  only to look after this generation. but future generations as well. so. . i will never forget a movie i saw during the war. the colonel comes before the pilots who have just graduated from pilot school. and some are going into fighters and some are going into bombers. the colonel who was addressing them happened to be a bomber pilot. he said. "heres where we separate the men from the boys." i am  taking any sides of pilots being fighter pilots or bomber pilots. but i will say that this is a tough decision that we are facing very shortly in this congress. i hope that those colleagues who are  here this evening who are still doubtful. will say that program is a good one. it is  only a good one for . but it is a good one. even more importantly. for future generations. i thank the chair.
s budget was rejected on nearly a straight partyline vote. the republican proposal will pass on a straight partyline vote. i expect. but the implementing legislation to the domenici proposal. the implementing legislation will undoubtedly be vetoed. thus. its entitlement reforms will  become law. just like last year. our budget. however. has a realistic chance of becoming law. today with a "yes" vote on the alternative. we can transform talk about deficit reduction into action. if we pass the chafeebreaux alternative. a balanced budget agreement can be reached this year. if this effort fails. then we will go through aher year without solving our nations fiscal problems.
. it is my belief that this important research effort warrants the very modest resources committed to it just 2 years ago. i might e that two papers submitted by the university as a result of this project have been published recently in peerreviewed scientific journals. thus. it is my hope that the epa administrator and her assistant administrator for research and development will give every consideration to providing the final year of funding for this effort in fiscal year 1997.
. private foundations have been involved in many more aspects of our daily lives than simply funding medical advances. dr. john v.n. dorr was an engineer in the early 1950s. he speculated that many accidents occurring on our nations highways during inclement weather were the result of drivers hugging the white lines painted in the middle of the road. dorr believed that if similar lines were painted on the shoulder side of the road. lives could be saved. dorr convinced transportation engineers in westchester county. ny. to test his theory along a particularly treacherous stretch of highway. the dropoff in accidents along this part of the road was dramatic. and dr. dorr used his own foundation to publicize the demonstrations results nationally. today. although state funds are  used to paint white lines on the shoulder side of the nations highways. every person traveling in motor vehicles is indebted to dorr and his foundation for implementing this lifesaving discoveryas these examples indicate. private foundations provide a great many benefits to our society. by permanently extending this tax incentive. we can continue to encourage individuals to dedicate a substantial portion of their wealth to public. rather than private purposes. i hope my colleagues will support this legislation. our bill permanently extends the tax incentive for an individual who contributes stock to a private foundation. this provision currently expires on under this bill. a taxpayer who contributes publicly traded stock to a private foundation would be allowed a deduction for the full fair market value of the stock. absent this legislation. the deduction would be limited to the cost basis of the stock. which for many dos effectively eliminates the incentive to make the donation. the legislation also conforms the due date for a private foundations first quarter estimated tax payment with the filing date for the annual tax return. currently. a private foundation is required to make its first quarter estimated tax payment on april 15. even though the annual income tax return is  due until may 15. under this bill. a foundations first estimated tax payment would be due on may 15. finally. the bill also simplifies the rules governing distributions from a private foundation to a charity located outside the united states. a similar proposal introduced in the 104th congress was estimated by the joint committee on taxation to cost $287 million over 5 years.
. today i join as a cosponsor of the highway trust fund integrity act of 1997. this legislation. sponsored by my colleague from missouri. senator bond. and cosponsored by senators nickles. cochran and grego. reestablishes the link between highway trust fund taxes and transportation spending. i believe that our proposal represents a reasonable and responsible solution to a problem that faces the congress as it considers the reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act. i hope that this bill will serve as a starting point for further discussions with my colleagues. especially my colleagues from the budget and appropriations committees. i recognize that proposals that modify the budget process are by their nature. controversial. and upset the status quo. however. i think change is necessary and the status quo is longer an acceptable outcome.
. i want to point out that the proposal suggested by the budget resolution is an important one.. but it is just one of the many that the finance committee may consider during the upcoming reconciliation process. as i mentioned. i believe that the budget resolution approach. as clarified by our amendment. goes a long way toward restoring fairness for vulnerable legal immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when the welfare law was enacted. but i must say that i am sorely disappointed that the budget resolution proposal leaves elderly legal immigrantsthose who by definition have other source of income and are too old and frail to workout in the cold. to my view. then. the budget resolution proposal therefore addresses only part of the problem. and i intend to work with my colleagues here and in the finance committee toward a more comprehensive solution.
. the garage addition authorized in this bill will come at a cost to the federal government. the project will be -financed through the issuance of industrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely wfth revenue derived from operation of the expanded garage. indeed. a provision included in the legislation explicitly prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the purpose of constructing or financing the parking garage expansion. also included in the bill is authorization for the center to take action on site modifications for the improvement of security on the site. the center has conducted a complete security review. and among the recommendations are changes to the -main approach and plaza. this legislation allows the center to pursue site modifications for the protection of the building and its visitors. consistent with the john f. kennedy center act amendments of 1994. the
. today i am introducing the transportation infrastructure finance and ination act of 1997.-or. tifia. the purpose of the bill is to bridge the gap between the nations substantial infrastructure needs and limited federal funds. i am pleased to report that senators graham of florida. boxer. hatch. bennett. and moynihan have joined me in cosponsoring this important measure. i think we can all agree that there is a clear shortfall of public funding to meet the nations transportation needs. our effort to balance the federal budget only makes the challenge of meeting these critical needs all the more difficult. the goals of our bill are to offer the sponsors of major transportation projects a new tool to make the most of limited federal resources. stimulate additional investment in our nations infrastructure. and encourage greater private sector participation in meeting our transportation needs. tifia establishes a new federal credit program for surface transportation. it will provide $800 million in credit assistance over six years to public and private entities. with the purpose of leveraging as much as $16 billion in federal funds for major transportation projects. in .turn. this federal investment could help leverage total investment in infrastructure from other public and private entities of $40 to $50 billion. eligible forms of credit assistance available through our proposal include loans. loan guarantees. and lines of credit.
. i ask unanimous consent that when the senate completes its business today. it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9 a.m. on friday. june 27. i further ask unanimous consent that on friday. immediately following the prayer. the routine requests through the morning hour be granted. and the senate immediately resume consideration of s. 949. the tax fairness relief act. and under the previous order the senate will begin a series of votes on or in relation to the pending amendments. i further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote. and. lastly. with regard to any amendment offered. following the reporting of the amendment the reading of the amendment be waived.
. for the information of all senators. tomorrow at 9 a.m. the senate will resume consideration of s. 949. the tax relief act of 1997 and begin aher lengthy series of rollcall votes. following the disposition of the pending amendments. additional amendments may be offered. however. it is hoped that members will refrain from offering amendments so that the senate may complete action on this bill at a reasonable time on friday.
. i want to take a moment to discuss one provision in the legislation  before the senate. under the heading of related .agencies. the commercestatejustice appropriations bill provides funding for the office of the u.s. trade representative. as my colleagues k. our nations special trade representative. backed by the team of staff at ustr. is responsible for negotiating and administering trade agreements and coordinating overall trade policy for the united states. those are significant responsibilities. and they are critical to the ecoic interests of american firms. workers. consumers. and families. for an agency with such significant duties. ustr does  consume much in the way of taxpayer monies. annual funding for ustr has hovered at just over $20 million for the past 5 years. in terms of the federal budgetor for that matter of the several other agencies funded by this bill-$20 million is a mere pittance. i might say that for what we get in return. the funds spent on ustr represent quite a bargain. thanks to ustr. we have in place trade agreements and policies that allow our companies to compete successfully worldwide. and where barriers remain. the ustr team works continuously to make further progress. their work over the years has affected billions of dollars in u.s. trade and contributes emously to the health of the overall u.s. ecoy. . ustr does  require much in funding because for the most part. appropriations are spent on two items: salaries and travel. those basic necessitiesthe salaries that pay the staff. and the travel that is required for the various ongoing negotiations with our trading partners around the worldmake up the bulk of ustrs financial needs. there is  much fat there. therefore. every dime they get is critical. i want to commend the chairman of the commercestatejustice subcommittee for allocating the full budget request for ustr for fiscal year 1998. under his bill. the office of the ustr will receive $22.092.000. exactly what the administration sought. i want to thank him for that. let me raise one concern. however. that i k is shared by the leadership and most members of the senate finance committee. since the january 1995 implementation of the uruguay round agreements and the wto. ustr has taken on an emous new docket of cases in which the united states is involved. and all of these cases  come with strict deadlines. as of july 1. there were pending some 47 wto or nafta cases in which the united states is a plaintiff. a defendant. or otherwise a participant. that is quite a workload. yet despite the increase. ustr has  increased its career legal staff. the number of lawyers and litigators  on staff is virtually the same as in the prewto days. ustr has just 12 lawyers in washington. with 2 more in geneva. and only 2 of them are able to devote themselves fulltime to the international litigation. that dearth of staff makes senseand only hurts our efforts to win our cases. i believe ustr must have the resources and personnel that it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. while i am delighted that ustr received its full budget request. i must say that the budget request amount is simply  realistic for an agency facing these new assignments. even a modest increase of. say. $1 millionwhich again. in terms of the federal budget is  even visiblewould make a significant and positive difference to the ability of ustr to carry out its work. and that in turn would only benefit us workers and families. and the overall us ecoy. i want to urge ustr to press the office of management and budget to recognize their new workload. i have mentioned this repeatedly to ambassador barshefsky and i hope she will act on it. and i want to exhort omb in the strongest terms possible to adjust next years budget request accordingly for ustr. i am confident that such an adjustment would be met with favor by the members of the authorizing committee. namely the senate finance committee. if omb fails to act. then it may fall to congress to do the right thing. and make the small but necessary increased investment in this agency. indeed. i seriously considered taking such a step during todays debate. but for  i will wait. thanks to the good work of the chairman. we do have in this bill $22 million in full funding for ustr. and i intend to do what i can to make sure that that full $22 million becomes law. however. i call upon the administration in uncertain terms to ensure that in the budget submitted next year. ustr is provided the resources they need.
i explain to the senate this amendment was made necessary to correct certain provisions that are in technical violation of the budget act. the bill reported by the committee stays within the overall spending limitations imposed by the budget resolution. but  every dollar is in the right category. we have made adjustments in this substitute amendment that correct those deficiencies. the adjustments do  affect the allocation of the dollars to any state  the certainty that those dollars will be delivered by the formula in the bill. the amendment does  affect the substantive provisions of the bill in any other respect. but puts some of the spending authorized by the bill under the obligation limitation to ensure that we meet the technical requirements of the budget act. it is my understanding the committee has a right to modify its amendments in this way. i polled the committee yesterday. and a majority of the members agreed to this modification. the substitute amendment  is the only committee amendment and is open to amendment by any senator and will be the vehicle for conducting debate on this bill.
 a month and a half ago. probably it is 2 months ago . that is a world record for this chamber. usually we dont deviate from a budget until we have gotten into it a little bit. but here we change it after a little less than 2 months. i dont think that is a very good record we should be proud of in this chamber. i k the distinguished chairman of the budget committee will be speaking. and i look forward to hearing his remarks.
madam president. i ask unanimous consent that two letters written by the congressional budget office be printed in the record. the first letter dated october 7. 1997. includes the cost estimate for s. 1173. the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1997. the istea bill we are considering . as reported by the committee on environment and public works. this letter points to certain technical violations of the budget act in s. 1173. we have made adjustments in the committee substitute for s. 1173 which was agreed to on october 8 to correct those deficiencies. so that is the first letter. madam president. the second letter. dated october 6. 1997. includes more detailed information on the minimum allocation program. one of the components of the federal aid highway program that is exempt from the annual obligation limitation. the committee on environment and public works used the information in the october 6 congressional budget office letter to make the technical budget corrections found in the committee substitute amendment to s.
i thank the senator for that because. so far. we have  been sure what we were dealing with. but  we k: i say this to the senator. i ask the senator. i listened to the statements on the floor here from the senator from texas and others. and there has been a lot of talk about truth in taxes and how wicked it was that this 4.3 cents has  gone for highways. and that it was deceptive to the american motoring public that when this tax was levied. it was levied on the basis that it would be used for bridges. highways. and so forth. yet. i ask the senator. was it  true when that tax was enacted. the 4.3cent additional gasoline tax. in 1993. it was crystal clear to everybody that that was a deficit reduction. am i correct in that.
well. madam president. the point i am making here is that. in 1993and we were all here at the time-:the president of the united states came forward with a deficit reduction program. in that deficit reduction programthis was in 1993there was a 4.3cent added gasoline tax imposed. it was crystal clear to everybody who paid any bit of attention to. it that that was for deficit reduction. that went into the general fund. it wasnt for gas. it wasnt for highways or bridges. it was for deficit reduction. i voted against it. every single republican voted against it. but that is neither here  there. the fact is that it passed. in those days. there were a majority of democratic senators in this body. and those 1993 moneys were clearly for deficit reduction. so the reason i am stressing this is because we have heard some powerful discussion here on the floor about truth in taxes and how unfair it is to the american public that when our wives go and pump the gas into the car. they believe that every tax they pay on that is going into roads and bridges. that may be what they think. but that isnt what the facts are. in 1993. it was crystal clear. there was all kinds of debate here. i am  saying that was wrong. i voted against the entire package but. as i said. that is neither here  there. it is clear that the money for gasoline taxes was to go for deficit reduction.
. also. when i listed the staff members that we worked so closely with. i omitted brian riley from the budget committee. who was extremely helpful to us. his kledge and expertise were very. very useful.
. s. 1417. a bill to authorize the secretary of the interior to provide for the design. construction. furnishing. and equipping of a center for performing arts within the complex kn as the new mexico hispanic cultural center. was introduced and passed the senate on ember 7. because the measure was considered and passed on the same day as its introduction. the committee on environment and public works was  referred s. 1417. and a report was  filed. subsequent to the passage of the legislation. however. the congressional budget office issued a cost estimate. as required under the senate rules. therefore. i ask that the letter from the director of the congressional budget office. dated ember 17. 1997. be printed in the record. the letter follows:

. again i issue a call to all who may be in their offices or listening.  is the time to bring up amendments. undoubtedly the distinguished ranking member will haye a statement. but after that we are ready to go. i will feel distressed if we just sit here waiting for people to respond and they do  bring over these amendments. as i say. there are some 200 amendments out there. some of them. obviously. are involved with fiscal matters which we can take up. but the others we can and we would like to. i thank the chair.

. we are going to vote . we were scheduled to vote at 10:30. i would like to stick with that if i could. i just dont want this to get into a budget discussion here on the floor of the senate at this particular time as we are trying to dispose of this legislation. i do  like to cut off the senator-

. the amounts would be allocated to each of the categories for which they had received that amount previously. for example. the amount each state will receive in the surface transportation program. socalled stp funds. under istea ii will be reduced by their portion of the more than $1 billion provided in stp funds for the 6month extension. there are several reasons why this reduction is necessary. first of all. istea ii provides money for each fiscal year 1998 through 2003. it does  provide a halfyear amount. if this reduction is  required and agreed to. the states would receive one and onehalf times as much as they should for 1998 and our bill would be subject to a point of order. second. the reduction ensures that each state will receive money based on the new formula provided in istea ii instead of the old formula. or amounts received in the past. we worked long and hard to update this formula to make it as fair as possible.
madam president. this is a package of amendments to the transportation infrastructure finance and ination act. socalled tifia. these include two types of changes. first. they make technical and controversial changes to the tifia subchapter. the majority were recommended by the u.s. department of transportation to improve and clarify provisions under this act. second. this package establishes a fee for those states that use the federal credit assistance to fund transportation projects under socalled tifia. this fee is necessary to offset the revenue loss that the joint committee on taxation estimated will result in the program. it is important to e we have confirmation from the congressional budget office that this fee will address the loss. i am pleased that tifia was included in the underlying bill. s. 1173. as it will assist the nation in funding the gap between transportation resources and needs.
. i am pleased to strongly support the amendment offered by the chairman of the finance committee which adds the revenue title to the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1997. along with extending the motor fuel excise taxes.- this amendment includes several changes to the nations tax laws that will further the goal of improving the quality of transportation in our country. i want to take a few moments to discuss a few of those provisions.
. i ask unanimous consent that the subcommittee on readiness of the committee on armed services be authorized to meet on wednesday. march 11. at 9:00 a.m. in open session. to receive testimony on environmental and military construction issues in review of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1999.

. as the chairman of the budget committee well ks. i am always opposed to taking these programs off budget. that is my position. and that is the position we will take going into conference. we have been treated very well by the budget committee in connection with this legislation. the budget chairman has assumed some very onerous burdens to find the money for us to come up with this program. certainly i dont think the answer is to take this trust fund off budget.
. i ask unanimous consent that the subcommittee on acquisition and tech ogy of the committee on armed services be authorized to meet at 9:30 a.m. on thursday. march 12. 1998. in open session. to receive testimony on the department of defense. science. and techogy programs in review of the defense authorization request for fiscal year 1999 and the future years defense program.

. today i the seventyfive cents per dose amount am introducing legislation reducing was chosen to satisfy the revenue neuthe excise tax on vaccines from sev- trality goals of the overall bill. conentyfive cents to twentyfive cents per gress did  solve the overfunding dose. i am introducing this bill along problem and the result was that while with my colleagues on the finance some vaccine taxes were reduced dracommittee. senators breaux. mack matically. others were increased. three and rockefeller as well as senators new vaccines were added to the prodaschle. murkowski. cochran. gram at the seventyfive cents per dose iye. lugar. bumpers. frist. and rate. santorum. at the beginning of this year. the vaccines are a modern miraclepre- vaccine injury compensation trust venting disease and illness often for a fund had a balance of 1.2 billion dollifetime with just a few doses. vaccines lars. if you assumed that future outlays from the fund would be twice as large as the funds average over the past eight years. it would take more than 20 years to exhaust the assets in the trust fund. even if excise tax revenues were collected from this date forward. stated aher way. the interest earned on the trust fund assets is more than egh to pay annual claims and administrative cost. as with many other trust funds within the federal budget. these taxes are being used for other federal spending. this proposal will also provide significant benefits to the states. when states purchase vaccines they pay the excise tax. our bill would save the states $52 million annually. for my home state of rhode island. that would amount to 353.000 dollars annually. by lowering these taxes we can lower health care costs to vaccine recipients and providers while saving states and the federal government the money they  pay in excise taxes when they buy vaccines. this proposal is supported by physicians. state health departments. manufacturers and parental groups. most significantly. the advisory commission on childhood vaccines (accv) which congress created to make recommendations on changes to the vaccine injury compensation program. strongly supports this proposal. i encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important health initiative.*
. i wish to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the armed services committee. senator thurmond. the report accompanying this legislation states that the committee has included $191.4 million for three "standard" c130j aircraft (in addition to funding for two other c130j variants). the administrations budget request included funding for one standard c130j for the active air force. thus. the committee added two standard c130js to the budget. the report further states that these two standard c130j aircraft added by this bill are designated for reserve component modernization. however. the report appears  to include a designation for the requested c130j. i would like to ask the chairman. does the committee intend that all three of the standard c130j aircraft in this bill simply the two added to the requestare designated for the air national guard.
. on september 11. 1998. the committee on environmental and public works filed senate report 105326. to accompany s. 2361. the disaster mitigation act of 1998. when the report was filed. the letter and analysis of the cost of the legislation prepared by the congressional budget office. as required by section 403 of the congressional budget and impoundment control act. was  available to the committee. that information was received on september 29. 1998. therefore. i request that the letter from the congressional budget office and cost analysis be placed in the washington. dc. september 29. 1998. hon. john h. chafee. chairman. committee on environment and public works. u.s. senate. washington. dc. dear :. the congressional budget office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for s. 2361. the disaster mitigation act of 1998. if you wish further details on this estimate. we will be pleased to provide them. the cbo staff contacts are kristen layman (for federal costs) and lisa cash driskill (for the state and local impact). sincerely.
. private foundations have been involved in many more aspects of our daily lives than simply funding medical advances. dr. john v.n. dorr was an engineer in the early 1950s. he speculated that many accidents occurring on our nations highways during inclement weather were the result of drivers hugging the white lines painted in the middle of the road. dorr believed that if similar lines were painted on the shoulder side of the road. lives could be saved. dorr convinced transportation engineers in westchester county. ny. to test his theory along a particularly treacherous stretch of highway. the dropoff in accidents along this part of the road was dramatic. and dr. dorr used his own foundation to publicize the demonstrations results nationally. today. although state funds are  used to paint white lines on the shoulder side of the nations highways. every person traveling in motor vehicles is indebted to dorr and his foundation for implementing this lifesaving discoveryas these examples indicate. private foundations provide a great many benefits to our society. by permanently extending this tax incentive. we can continue to encourage individuals to dedicate a substantial portion of their wealth to public. rather than private purposes. i hope my colleagues will support this legislation. our bill permanently extends the tax incentive for an individual who contributes stock to a private foundation. this provision currently expires on under this bill. a taxpayer who contributes publicly traded stock to a private foundation would be allowed a deduction for the full fair market value of the stock. absent this legislation. the deduction would be limited to the cost basis of the stock. which for many dos effectively eliminates the incentive to make the donation. the legislation also conforms the due date for a private foundations first quarter estimated tax payment with the filing date for the annual tax return. currently. a private foundation is required to make its first quarter estimated tax payment on april 15. even though the annual income tax return is  due until may 15. under this bill. a foundations first estimated tax payment would be due on may 15. finally. the bill also simplifies the rules governing distributions from a private foundation to a charity located outside the united states. a similar proposal introduced in the 104th congress was estimated by the joint committee on taxation to cost $287 million over 5 years.
. today i join as a cosponsor of the highway trust fund integrity act of 1997. this legislation. sponsored by my colleague from missouri. senator bond. and cosponsored by senators nickles. cochran and grego. reestablishes the link between highway trust fund taxes and transportation spending. i believe that our proposal represents a reasonable and responsible solution to a problem that faces the congress as it considers the reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act. i hope that this bill will serve as a starting point for further discussions with my colleagues. especially my colleagues from the budget and appropriations committees. i recognize that proposals that modify the budget process are by their nature. controversial. and upset the status quo. however. i think change is necessary and the status quo is longer an acceptable outcome.
. i want to point out that the proposal suggested by the budget resolution is an important one.. but it is just one of the many that the finance committee may consider during the upcoming reconciliation process. as i mentioned. i believe that the budget resolution approach. as clarified by our amendment. goes a long way toward restoring fairness for vulnerable legal immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when the welfare law was enacted. but i must say that i am sorely disappointed that the budget resolution proposal leaves elderly legal immigrantsthose who by definition have other source of income and are too old and frail to workout in the cold. to my view. then. the budget resolution proposal therefore addresses only part of the problem. and i intend to work with my colleagues here and in the finance committee toward a more comprehensive solution.
. the garage addition authorized in this bill will come at a cost to the federal government. the project will be -financed through the issuance of industrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely wfth revenue derived from operation of the expanded garage. indeed. a provision included in the legislation explicitly prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the purpose of constructing or financing the parking garage expansion. also included in the bill is authorization for the center to take action on site modifications for the improvement of security on the site. the center has conducted a complete security review. and among the recommendations are changes to the -main approach and plaza. this legislation allows the center to pursue site modifications for the protection of the building and its visitors. consistent with the john f. kennedy center act amendments of 1994. the
. today i am introducing the transportation infrastructure finance and ination act of 1997.-or. tifia. the purpose of the bill is to bridge the gap between the nations substantial infrastructure needs and limited federal funds. i am pleased to report that senators graham of florida. boxer. hatch. bennett. and moynihan have joined me in cosponsoring this important measure. i think we can all agree that there is a clear shortfall of public funding to meet the nations transportation needs. our effort to balance the federal budget only makes the challenge of meeting these critical needs all the more difficult. the goals of our bill are to offer the sponsors of major transportation projects a new tool to make the most of limited federal resources. stimulate additional investment in our nations infrastructure. and encourage greater private sector participation in meeting our transportation needs. tifia establishes a new federal credit program for surface transportation. it will provide $800 million in credit assistance over six years to public and private entities. with the purpose of leveraging as much as $16 billion in federal funds for major transportation projects. in .turn. this federal investment could help leverage total investment in infrastructure from other public and private entities of $40 to $50 billion. eligible forms of credit assistance available through our proposal include loans. loan guarantees. and lines of credit.
. i ask unanimous consent that when the senate completes its business today. it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9 a.m. on friday. june 27. i further ask unanimous consent that on friday. immediately following the prayer. the routine requests through the morning hour be granted. and the senate immediately resume consideration of s. 949. the tax fairness relief act. and under the previous order the senate will begin a series of votes on or in relation to the pending amendments. i further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote. and. lastly. with regard to any amendment offered. following the reporting of the amendment the reading of the amendment be waived.
. for the information of all senators. tomorrow at 9 a.m. the senate will resume consideration of s. 949. the tax relief act of 1997 and begin aher lengthy series of rollcall votes. following the disposition of the pending amendments. additional amendments may be offered. however. it is hoped that members will refrain from offering amendments so that the senate may complete action on this bill at a reasonable time on friday.
. i want to take a moment to discuss one provision in the legislation  before the senate. under the heading of related .agencies. the commercestatejustice appropriations bill provides funding for the office of the u.s. trade representative. as my colleagues k. our nations special trade representative. backed by the team of staff at ustr. is responsible for negotiating and administering trade agreements and coordinating overall trade policy for the united states. those are significant responsibilities. and they are critical to the ecoic interests of american firms. workers. consumers. and families. for an agency with such significant duties. ustr does  consume much in the way of taxpayer monies. annual funding for ustr has hovered at just over $20 million for the past 5 years. in terms of the federal budgetor for that matter of the several other agencies funded by this bill-$20 million is a mere pittance. i might say that for what we get in return. the funds spent on ustr represent quite a bargain. thanks to ustr. we have in place trade agreements and policies that allow our companies to compete successfully worldwide. and where barriers remain. the ustr team works continuously to make further progress. their work over the years has affected billions of dollars in u.s. trade and contributes emously to the health of the overall u.s. ecoy. . ustr does  require much in funding because for the most part. appropriations are spent on two items: salaries and travel. those basic necessitiesthe salaries that pay the staff. and the travel that is required for the various ongoing negotiations with our trading partners around the worldmake up the bulk of ustrs financial needs. there is  much fat there. therefore. every dime they get is critical. i want to commend the chairman of the commercestatejustice subcommittee for allocating the full budget request for ustr for fiscal year 1998. under his bill. the office of the ustr will receive $22.092.000. exactly what the administration sought. i want to thank him for that. let me raise one concern. however. that i k is shared by the leadership and most members of the senate finance committee. since the january 1995 implementation of the uruguay round agreements and the wto. ustr has taken on an emous new docket of cases in which the united states is involved. and all of these cases  come with strict deadlines. as of july 1. there were pending some 47 wto or nafta cases in which the united states is a plaintiff. a defendant. or otherwise a participant. that is quite a workload. yet despite the increase. ustr has  increased its career legal staff. the number of lawyers and litigators  on staff is virtually the same as in the prewto days. ustr has just 12 lawyers in washington. with 2 more in geneva. and only 2 of them are able to devote themselves fulltime to the international litigation. that dearth of staff makes senseand only hurts our efforts to win our cases. i believe ustr must have the resources and personnel that it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. while i am delighted that ustr received its full budget request. i must say that the budget request amount is simply  realistic for an agency facing these new assignments. even a modest increase of. say. $1 millionwhich again. in terms of the federal budget is  even visiblewould make a significant and positive difference to the ability of ustr to carry out its work. and that in turn would only benefit us workers and families. and the overall us ecoy. i want to urge ustr to press the office of management and budget to recognize their new workload. i have mentioned this repeatedly to ambassador barshefsky and i hope she will act on it. and i want to exhort omb in the strongest terms possible to adjust next years budget request accordingly for ustr. i am confident that such an adjustment would be met with favor by the members of the authorizing committee. namely the senate finance committee. if omb fails to act. then it may fall to congress to do the right thing. and make the small but necessary increased investment in this agency. indeed. i seriously considered taking such a step during todays debate. but for  i will wait. thanks to the good work of the chairman. we do have in this bill $22 million in full funding for ustr. and i intend to do what i can to make sure that that full $22 million becomes law. however. i call upon the administration in uncertain terms to ensure that in the budget submitted next year. ustr is provided the resources they need.
i explain to the senate this amendment was made necessary to correct certain provisions that are in technical violation of the budget act. the bill reported by the committee stays within the overall spending limitations imposed by the budget resolution. but  every dollar is in the right category. we have made adjustments in this substitute amendment that correct those deficiencies. the adjustments do  affect the allocation of the dollars to any state  the certainty that those dollars will be delivered by the formula in the bill. the amendment does  affect the substantive provisions of the bill in any other respect. but puts some of the spending authorized by the bill under the obligation limitation to ensure that we meet the technical requirements of the budget act. it is my understanding the committee has a right to modify its amendments in this way. i polled the committee yesterday. and a majority of the members agreed to this modification. the substitute amendment  is the only committee amendment and is open to amendment by any senator and will be the vehicle for conducting debate on this bill.
 a month and a half ago. probably it is 2 months ago . that is a world record for this chamber. usually we dont deviate from a budget until we have gotten into it a little bit. but here we change it after a little less than 2 months. i dont think that is a very good record we should be proud of in this chamber. i k the distinguished chairman of the budget committee will be speaking. and i look forward to hearing his remarks.
madam president. i ask unanimous consent that two letters written by the congressional budget office be printed in the record. the first letter dated october 7. 1997. includes the cost estimate for s. 1173. the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1997. the istea bill we are considering . as reported by the committee on environment and public works. this letter points to certain technical violations of the budget act in s. 1173. we have made adjustments in the committee substitute for s. 1173 which was agreed to on october 8 to correct those deficiencies. so that is the first letter. madam president. the second letter. dated october 6. 1997. includes more detailed information on the minimum allocation program. one of the components of the federal aid highway program that is exempt from the annual obligation limitation. the committee on environment and public works used the information in the october 6 congressional budget office letter to make the technical budget corrections found in the committee substitute amendment to s.
i thank the senator for that because. so far. we have  been sure what we were dealing with. but  we k: i say this to the senator. i ask the senator. i listened to the statements on the floor here from the senator from texas and others. and there has been a lot of talk about truth in taxes and how wicked it was that this 4.3 cents has  gone for highways. and that it was deceptive to the american motoring public that when this tax was levied. it was levied on the basis that it would be used for bridges. highways. and so forth. yet. i ask the senator. was it  true when that tax was enacted. the 4.3cent additional gasoline tax. in 1993. it was crystal clear to everybody that that was a deficit reduction. am i correct in that.
well. madam president. the point i am making here is that. in 1993and we were all here at the time-:the president of the united states came forward with a deficit reduction program. in that deficit reduction programthis was in 1993there was a 4.3cent added gasoline tax imposed. it was crystal clear to everybody who paid any bit of attention to. it that that was for deficit reduction. that went into the general fund. it wasnt for gas. it wasnt for highways or bridges. it was for deficit reduction. i voted against it. every single republican voted against it. but that is neither here  there. the fact is that it passed. in those days. there were a majority of democratic senators in this body. and those 1993 moneys were clearly for deficit reduction. so the reason i am stressing this is because we have heard some powerful discussion here on the floor about truth in taxes and how unfair it is to the american public that when our wives go and pump the gas into the car. they believe that every tax they pay on that is going into roads and bridges. that may be what they think. but that isnt what the facts are. in 1993. it was crystal clear. there was all kinds of debate here. i am  saying that was wrong. i voted against the entire package but. as i said. that is neither here  there. it is clear that the money for gasoline taxes was to go for deficit reduction.
. also. when i listed the staff members that we worked so closely with. i omitted brian riley from the budget committee. who was extremely helpful to us. his kledge and expertise were very. very useful.
. s. 1417. a bill to authorize the secretary of the interior to provide for the design. construction. furnishing. and equipping of a center for performing arts within the complex kn as the new mexico hispanic cultural center. was introduced and passed the senate on ember 7. because the measure was considered and passed on the same day as its introduction. the committee on environment and public works was  referred s. 1417. and a report was  filed. subsequent to the passage of the legislation. however. the congressional budget office issued a cost estimate. as required under the senate rules. therefore. i ask that the letter from the director of the congressional budget office. dated ember 17. 1997. be printed in the record. the letter follows:

. again i issue a call to all who may be in their offices or listening.  is the time to bring up amendments. undoubtedly the distinguished ranking member will haye a statement. but after that we are ready to go. i will feel distressed if we just sit here waiting for people to respond and they do  bring over these amendments. as i say. there are some 200 amendments out there. some of them. obviously. are involved with fiscal matters which we can take up. but the others we can and we would like to. i thank the chair.

. today i the seventyfive cents per dose amount am introducing legislation reducing was chosen to satisfy the revenue neuthe excise tax on vaccines from sev- trality goals of the overall bill. conentyfive cents to twentyfive cents per gress did  solve the overfunding dose. i am introducing this bill along problem and the result was that while with my colleagues on the finance some vaccine taxes were reduced dracommittee. senators breaux. mack matically. others were increased. three and rockefeller as well as senators new vaccines were added to the prodaschle. murkowski. cochran. gram at the seventyfive cents per dose iye. lugar. bumpers. frist. and rate. santorum. at the beginning of this year. the vaccines are a modern miraclepre- vaccine injury compensation trust venting disease and illness often for a fund had a balance of 1.2 billion dollifetime with just a few doses. vaccines lars. if you assumed that future outlays from the fund would be twice as large as the funds average over the past eight years. it would take more than 20 years to exhaust the assets in the trust fund. even if excise tax revenues were collected from this date forward. stated aher way. the interest earned on the trust fund assets is more than egh to pay annual claims and administrative cost. as with many other trust funds within the federal budget. these taxes are being used for other federal spending. this proposal will also provide significant benefits to the states. when states purchase vaccines they pay the excise tax. our bill would save the states $52 million annually. for my home state of rhode island. that would amount to 353.000 dollars annually. by lowering these taxes we can lower health care costs to vaccine recipients and providers while saving states and the federal government the money they  pay in excise taxes when they buy vaccines. this proposal is supported by physicians. state health departments. manufacturers and parental groups. most significantly. the advisory commission on childhood vaccines (accv) which congress created to make recommendations on changes to the vaccine injury compensation program. strongly supports this proposal. i encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important health initiative.*
. i wish to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the armed services committee. senator thurmond. the report accompanying this legislation states that the committee has included $191.4 million for three "standard" c130j aircraft (in addition to funding for two other c130j variants). the administrations budget request included funding for one standard c130j for the active air force. thus. the committee added two standard c130js to the budget. the report further states that these two standard c130j aircraft added by this bill are designated for reserve component modernization. however. the report appears  to include a designation for the requested c130j. i would like to ask the chairman. does the committee intend that all three of the standard c130j aircraft in this bill simply the two added to the requestare designated for the air national guard.
. on september 11. 1998. the committee on environmental and public works filed senate report 105326. to accompany s. 2361. the disaster mitigation act of 1998. when the report was filed. the letter and analysis of the cost of the legislation prepared by the congressional budget office. as required by section 403 of the congressional budget and impoundment control act. was  available to the committee. that information was received on september 29. 1998. therefore. i request that the letter from the congressional budget office and cost analysis be placed in the washington. dc. september 29. 1998. hon. john h. chafee. chairman. committee on environment and public works. u.s. senate. washington. dc. dear :. the congressional budget office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for s. 2361. the disaster mitigation act of 1998. if you wish further details on this estimate. we will be pleased to provide them. the cbo staff contacts are kristen layman (for federal costs) and lisa cash driskill (for the state and local impact). sincerely.
. the table to which i have referred indicates that in 1971. 3.71 percent of the transportation budget was for the sst and 4.95 percent was for urban mass transport. in fiscal 1972. 2.78 percent was for the sst and 7.1 percent was for urban mass transit.
. the table shows 6 million american passengers in international air travel in fiscal .1971 and nearly 6 billion american passengers in ground transportation in fiscal when related to the previous table this demonstrates that federal expenditures per passenger for various modes of transportation are as indicated on the following table entitled "federal expenditures per passenger for various modes of transportation." which i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record.
i regret to find myself in opposition to the amendment of the senator from maryland and the senator from wisconsin. and for the very reason enunciated by the senator from maryland. who said that this amendment gives the widest latitude to the department of defense to make cuts. that is the whole problem. some of us feel that the widest latitude is given to the department of defense to go ahead and raise its budget. clearly. in my mind. that is a job that belongs to congress. both as to the cutting of any moneys. and in the way of raising the budget for the department of defense. our job is to consider the specific weapons for a system and to see if. in fact. they enhance the security of the united states. the defense budget should be examined both in this body and in the house of representatives. i am  willing in any manner. shape. or form. to give wide latitude to the defense department.
. i repeat to the distinguished senator from maryland that the job of examining the budget and making cuts is  the job of the defense department. it is the job of the senate. we have ourselves in the bind we are in today because we gave to the defense department the job of getting whatever they asked for without cxvii- 1427part 17 coming to congress. if it applies for one situation. it applies for the other.
. i would like to associate myself with the comments of my colleague from virginia. i think what is at issue hereand he touched upon itis the word "credibility." which seems to be in tenuous straits as between the government and the public. but will certainly become tenuous between the executive and the legislative branches of government mless we have those persons from the executive branch coming to convince us in the position where they can speak frankly and openly. david packard. in the course of his career. has made decisions which have  always been favorable to my state of connecticut. but they were always well reasoned. and he was fair and objective. i think he has done a fantastic job in the defense department of trying to bring order out of chaos. as was well stated by the senator from virginia. for the sake of credibility as between this branch of government and the executive branch. i would hope we could have a feeling that when men come from that area of government they do  arrive as messenger boys. but. rather. that they are before us using those minds for which minds they were selected for their complicated jobs in the first instance. in the course of the weeks and months ahead. i would hope that the administration would realize that the comments of secretary packard are healthyeven though i happen to disagree with the lockheed loanfor giving credibility to the administrations request. if there is anything that would turn one against the lockheed loan. it would be any sort of retibution against the clear thinking of this man.
. i thank the senator from iowa. i would like to ask the senator from georgia a question. we have heard during the course of this debate various figures as to who will gain employment and who will lose employment. however. we have also heard from the senator from ohio that the employees of the general electric are being cut back in their engine division. we k that is a fact. and i can assure the senator from georgia of the fact that the employees of the pratt & whitney division of the united aircraft. also .engine manufacturers. are being cut back. without getting into the broad argument as to who is gaining and who is losing jobs. how do we explain to these unemployed employees of american engine manufacturers the fact that as they stand there to get their unemployment checks. their taxes are going to be used to create jobs in the rollsroyce corp. in great britain. i am trying to get a response as to what explanation will be given. it is one thing to go ahead and lose ones job. i think that it is a little bit too muchwould  the senator from georgia agreethat after one has lost his job. his taxes would then go to pay the fellows who caused him to lose his job.
i agree with the senator from wisconsin. so does  this really come down to the fact that. on an investment basis. ody would even be asking the taxpayers to do this if it were  for the ecoic times. it really is a jobs situation. the question is whether we had better handle that by other legislation and other authorization.
i think he is probably fairly correct. that is the estimate today. or within recent times. by secretary volpe. i have before me a copy of a magazine called "lockheed horizons." dated january 1970. wherein the estimate of the lockheed corp. as to the market for this type of plane is stated as 1.400. this is the type of overoptimism which has put lockheed in the position where it is today. this is big disparity. it is about twice the estimated market760 against lockheeds 1.400. a year later. the chairman of lockheed himself admitted that they had been overoptimistic. but why. in heavens name. should the american people have to pay for the overoptimism. that is all i would ask. the senator says we are. or should be. concerned about persons losing their jobs. and i agree with the senator from georgia. but please understand this: under this contract. with the engine manufacture going to rollsroyce in great britain. day by day. as annced yesterday. the employees of general electric. in their engine plants. are being laid off. the employees of united aircraft. in their pratt and whitney division. are being laid off. as i stated yesterday. it is a little bit much to ask the fellow being laid off to take his taxes and give them to the british government so they can build the rollsroyce engine. this is the type of concern we should be showing. i make bones about the fact that the lockheed corp. is under the free enterprise system. which. as a part of it. rewards with success managerial efficiency and good products. there is point in hiding that under the rug here today. but the other part of that free enterprise system condemns you to failure if you are managerially inefficient or have bad products. those are the two sides of the free enterprise system. unless the two go hand in hand. if we try to eliminate the failure aspect of it. we are asking for nationalization of american industry. and i am  about to let that happen through what we do on the senate floor.
. i commend the senator from virginia for his comments. i think that there probably is one. either within this body or outside it. who does  associate fiscal responsibility and sound fiscal judgment with the senator from virginia. this has been. his life. and it is good to hear his comments so eloquently expressed. as he has said. the only misfortune is that  egh people are listening. because it takes a little thought and a little homework. but unless they do listen. i concur with his conclusion as to what will happen with the ecoy of this nation.
. . to turn from fiscal responsibility and sound fiscal judgment to the rather irresponsible and fiscally unsound measure before the senate. we are drawing to the end of todays proceedings. and i should like to make a few points with respect to some of the events of this day. first. we were greeted late this morning with statements by the chairman of the board of lockheed criticizing the senator from wisconsinmy only regret is that he left out the senator from connecticutfor engaging in debate on the lockheed loan proposal. later in the day. we had a news release indicating doubt on the part of the secretary of defense relative to the proposed legislation. therein lies the lesson for the chairman of lockheed. therein lies the lesson as to why we do  rush things thiough here and why debate is necessary. i find those who are trying to sell the lockheed loan proposal much in the same position of those who have an old engine that does  work and put rubberbands on it. hoping that if a buyer comes in. they can run it for 10 minutes. or in the position of someone who is trying to sell a boat with bubble gum in the planking. and when the buyer watches for 3 or 4 minutes. everything is all right. but if by some chance the engine has to run for a prolonged period of time or the boat has to stay in the water for a prolonged period of time. the rubberbands break and the bubble gum comes out. and the boat starts to sink. i consider the proposed legislation in the same fashionhastily put together. geared for a specific purpose. totally against the traditions that have made this the ecoically greatest nation in the world. so this chamber is  about ready to listen to the insults of the chairman of lockheed and rush through its deliberations but. rather. to take the necessary time. in the hope that the defects of the measure will become abundantly clear. just as they have in many other instances. this is  an exception. in other words. the senator from wisconsin and i are  asking for any exception. we do  do business in this chamber as lockheed does business. we do it in the same way for everybody. without exception. this is the point that the senator from wisconsin and i have tried to make during the course of the debate. the danger in the proposed legislation is that it is an exception. it goes against every rule. every piece of commonsense. every bit of practice that has been engaged in over hundreds of years. i should like to make aher point with respect to the debate as it has taken place thus far. there are those who would indicate that this is a republicandemocratic contest. it is . there are supporters and there are opponents who come from both political paxties. this is  one party against the other. there are those who will indicate that this is a clique that is against the aerospace industry. that is against science and techogy. may i remind my colleagues that the state i represent is deeply involved with the aerospace industry.
i thank the senator from wisconsin. i concur. i k that he feels as i do. that what is at issue here is the legislation itself. we do  come into this chamber with any particular preconceived ions but. rather. to try to judge each issue on the basis of its content. which is what i believe the senator from wisconsinwhich i k the senator from wisconsinhas done in this instance. there are those who would give the impression that this is california versus connecticut. ohio versus georgia. insofar as we have companies that are  participating in this program and those states do. may i point out that. as part of the lobbying effort on behalf of the lockheed corp.. i have made abundantly clear that there are x number of subcontracts in my state of connecticut which are  coming to pass. should this legislation go down the drain. i have had it made abundantly clear to me by the largest subcontractor to lockheed that it would be most advisable if i did support the legislation. because possibly other companies in my state would receive additional work. so i am quite aware ecoically as to what it means. it would mean some loss of jobs for the people of my state in taking the position i do. but. 
we find the assets of the lockheed corp. fluctuating rather drastically from day to day. from week to week. and from month to month. on the basis of their track record. again. sitting as a loan committee. this is what we have to look at: i would indicate to you. . that i do  think todays assets will necessarily be tomorrows assets. so far as the lockheed corp. is concerned. i do  think that the administration or the secretary of the treasury are all wet. i merely think that they are wrong on this piece of legislation. i say that it would  be fair for me to try to intimate to anyone that $250 million is being paid out in cash to lockheed. but neither do i think it is fair that the proponents of the bill should intimate to the public that there is  the possibility that the $250 million could go out. if the worst arrives. it can. the government is different than someone keeping his own budget in his own home. or any state. or any corporation. we have to set aside $250 million. it has got to be set aside because if failure occurs. that is the fund we go into. it is possible for the taxpayers to have to pay it. however. for my part. i will cease in any way to indicate that the taxpayers will. if this bill is approved. rapidly have to fork over the $250 million. even though this has a guarantee. the $250 million payment is the money of the taxpayers of the united states.
i am trying to clarify the question raised by the senator from alaska. point  2 is that. since we have  passed the bill. the board has  been set upthe board consisting of the secretary of the treasury. the chairman of the federal reserve board. and the president of the board in the districtso they have  set up any criteria in the evaluation of any loan request. does the senator from georgia k that the chairman of this board will be arthur burns. since he is the chairman of the federal reserve board. does the senator k that  assigned this task to the secretary of the treasury some time ago. he has worked at it. in these circumstances. i did  consider it my duty or responsibility to involve myself in the details of lockheed finances. this is the man who is going to head the board that is automatically going to put its stamp of approval on the loan guarantee.
 i can agree to those comments by the senator from west virginia. he ks as well as i do that the office of management and budget changes from administration to administration and that the people with authority in 1956 are totally different from those who are there . i believe it is safe to say that any financial arm of the executive branch. be it the u.s. government. the government of a state. the government of the state of west virginia. or the government of the state of connecticut. is basically opposed to a trust fund principle.
as i understand the amendment of the senator from tennessee and the senator from michigan. what they are saying is that the giving of the political moneys should be motivated by the quality of the candidate. by the logic of the issues. by the stands of the candidate. and  by any tax gimmickry which goes ahead and cajoles the taxpayer into giving money to a presidential campaign fund. in other words. is  priority. in the minds of the senators from tennessee and michigan. given to the quality of the man. and the quality of the issues. rather than to some tax dodge.
if i may clarify that. you are  trying to motivate the act of giving by giving a tax advantage. you are. in other words. trying to motive political contributions by factors other than special tax advantages.
. it proves itself in the bill because the senator proposes to use the taxes of american taxpayers. the bill longer gives the taxpayers a choice on candidates or issues. however. it will give a subsidy for mediocrity. that is what the senator is asking for. because if in fact the democratic party does  have money the republican campaign fund does. it is because mr. johnson did  cut it in 1968 and mr. nixon did and does.
 can veto or . well he can. the senator is forcing him to accept this particular provision if. in fact. he wants to see our people get back to work and our ecoy strengthened. so when we talk about subterfuge. the subterfuge lies in sticking this amendment on the revenue act of 1971.
. the pending pastore amendment probably could be called. in my opinion. "the emergency politicians employment act of 1971." because that is the only employment. i see. that will be increasing in the days ahead. as we will be taking care of ourselves before we will be trying to help the american people. this does  stand as a separate issue before the senate but. rather. is the creation of this large fund to be made available to the politicians of this country. i represent the state of connecticut which has 10 percent unemployment today. because of the miscalculations of previous democratic administrations in getting us into the vietnam war which the american public as a whole must pay for. i suspect. more than the money. that is the reason why the democrats are  in the white house today. yet they have the gall to come on to the floor of the senate at a time when americans are being asked to sacrifice at home in order to get the country back into a strong ecoic position. and try to squeeze this amendment into the revenue act of i think that is irony. i believe that the american public will  appreciate that for very long. if anyone can show me the connection between this amendment and what i shall repeat exactly what the bill is supposed to be all about. namely. the first item. "put our present lagging ecoy on the high growth path." this fund would be made available to candidates at all levels. where does that relate to "putting our present lagging ecoy on the high growth path". the second item in the summary is "increase the number of jobs and diminish the high unemployment rate." how does this amendment accomplish that. "relieve the hardships imposed by inflation on those with modest incomes." we can do that because it takes $1 out of everyones pocket and puts that money into the pockets of politicians. "provide a rational system of tax incentives to aid in the modernization of our productive facilities." i suggest that if the democratic party wants to modernize itself. it do so on the issues rather than on the peoples money. "increase our exports and improve our balance of payments." if there is some connection between any of the purposes i have cited in the report of the committee of the distinguished senator from louisiana . i would very much like to k what it is. in the attempt of the distinguished senator from colorado to try to whittle down the bill. he has my 100percent support. but may i suggest that i do  think it stands to the credit of this body if we should adopt the pastore amendment when we have people throughout the country who are very much in need and who are suffering. we keep talking about the "little people" who are out of work. and so forth. but that does  have anything to do with what we are discussing here. except that we are trying to figure out a better way of slicing up the american taxpayers money and giving it to ourselves. i think it is a disgrace.
the purpose of the legislation before us. as stated by the report. was to: put our present lagging ecoy on the high growth path. increase the number of jobs and diminish the high unemployment rate. i would like to k what the pastore amendment has to do with that. relieve the hardships imposed by inflation on those with modest incomes. i would like to k what the pastore amendment has to do with that.
(reading): provide a rational system of tax incentives to aid in the modernization of our productive facilities. i would like to k what the pastore amendment has to do with that. increase our exports and improve our balance of payments. i would like to k what the pastore amendment has to do with that.
. i would hope that in the time ahead. in the immediate time ahead. it would be possible to sit down with the proponents of the pastore amendment and. quite frankly. make it a better amendment. with suggestions presented by the senator from maryland and the senator from connecticut. on the side of substance. on the side of ethics. and on the side of propriety. ody is saying that the pastore amendment is wrong. it has merit. but it has become obvious that additional good ideas have been presented on the floor. i hope that as we go back to the tax measure. if that is what we are going to do. we oan utilize some of the ideas to make it a better amendment.
i certainly think the new york times is a newspaper of prestigedoubt about itbut it is wrong many. many times. it is wrong on this bill. the other day we had a graphic example of what we are trying to avoid in this billand this is  a personal reference to one of my colleagues. because it could have been the senator from maine or it could have been the senator from massachusetts. it could have been one of many senators. but the fact is that on a morning a few days ago one of our colleagues had a press conference in which he annced he was running for the presidency of the united states. then he walked 100 yards to the chamber to vote on federally raised campaign funds for that run. we as senators should  participate in this fund. neither should the president of the united states. e of us should participate in the benefits of a law that we are enacting. i think that is the key point. i do  deny the concept that the senator from rhode island is trying to bring into beingspecifically. that ecoics should  play a role in any mans ability to run for office in the united states. i agree 100 percent with the senator that the dollar should  make any difference. so to that extent the senator has a valid point. but to the extent that we tailor this particular legislation so that we senators and our parties will be the beneficiaries before we go before the public and tell them what we are doing. i think it is wrong. this concept was denied by the senator from rhode island and his colleagues when they rejected my amendment to make the law effective 6 years from . in a few minutes. after we dispose of this vote. senators will have an opportunity to say that ody holding public office  can participate in this fund until after january 1. 1973. do my senators think it might  stand to our credit to enact legislation that would make it possible for any american to run for office and  be restricted by a lack of funds. while at the same time denying this advantage to ourselves in the immediate future. then what we did would be with clean hands. we are  tailoring it to the debt of one party or the fact that the money will go into our partys campaigns or that the president will get the fund.
. the amendment. i believe. is selfexplanatory. in essence. what i am doing here is trying to bring some measure of balance into what the senate has been doing during the past week. if $100 million sounds like a great deal of money to go to small business. i :think it important to e that in the ecoic packages before our body. roughly $26 billion has been accorded to the ecoy and principally to the benefit of big business and big labor. the fact remains that out of 5.275.000 firms in our nation. 95 percent of them are small businesses. four out of every 10 civilian jobs in the ecoy are involved in small businesses. i do  exactly see how we can enjoy any measure of ecoic recovery unless we pay some attention to that aspect of our ecoy. the united states is  just general motors and the aflcio. it is many small businesses and many persons employed in those businesses. in 1970. roughly 11.000 small businesses went underwent down the chute. this was  the prospective failure of a lockheed or the prospective failure of a pencentral11.000 went under. in 1970. aftertax earnings of corporations with assets of less than $1 million went down 45 percent. as compared to those corporations with assets of over $1 million. whose earnings were down only 13 percent.
to be conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate insists upon its amendments to the bill entitled "an act making appropriations for agricultureenvironmental and consumer protection programs for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1973. and for other purposes." requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. mcgee. mr.
. the senator from west virginia has been better than his word for he indicated that he would consider the additional funds "provided a budget estimate comes up." unfortunately. budget estimate ever arrived. but the senator. recognizing the urgent necessity for creating a truly high quality intercity rail system. urged his subcommittee and the full appropriations committee to approve the funds anyway. i congratulate the senator for his farsightedness and thank him. on behalf of all the american people. for his efforts to bring balance to our national transportation system.
. i am submitting today an amendment o s. 372. the federal election campaign act amendments of 1973. which would make available to the voters. 2 weeks before an election for federal office. a complete report of each candidates campaign finances. this report would account for all sources of money raised and all expenditures made or obligated before the election. the theory is that new regulations proposed in this amendment would bring the complete facts as to the role money played in each campaign to the voters attention. 2 weeks before the electionin plenty of time for the voters to make their judgment about each candidates use of money. this public disclosure would afford greater insurance against the abuse of our system of elections. greater by far than new election laws. commissions. or provisions for stricter penalties. in simplest terms. this amendment provides that as of a date 2 weeks before the election. more contributions may be accepted. more expenditures may be contracted for or budgeted for. and a complete financial report must be filed immediately. to accomplish this result. three separate amendments to the pending legislation would be required. first. the reporting section would be amended to require each condidate to file a cumulative financial report of all contributions received and all disbursements made as of the date 2 weeks before the election. this report shall also include an accounting of future expenditures. those contracted for or budgeted for. in connection with the candidates campaign. second. the section on expenditures is amended to provide that expenditures may be made in behalf of the political candidate after 2 weeks before the election for anything  reported as contracted for or budgeted for in the report of that date. third. the "limitations on contributions" section is amended to prohibit any contributions to or for the benefit of a candidate after 2 weeks before the election. far from hinder campaign operations. this amendment should be a blessing in disguise. money could be spent in the last 2 weeks of the campaign. but only for items duly reported as contracted for or budgeted for in that period. this means that each candidate is responsible for keeping current all financial records. especially as the final preelection reporting date approaches. clearly. any deficit would become public kledge before the electionand such a deficit would under the provisions of this bill become the personal liability of the candidate. this is by means a waiver of the maximum limit established by the pending bill on contributions from the candidates personal funds or those of the candidates family. therefore. this amendment forces the selfpolicing of campaign financing by each candidate. in the future. then. the impracticality of deficit spending will compel candidates to utilize improved accounting procedures. and will cause campaign creditors to reassess their practice of extending unlimited credit to favored candidates. furthermore. this restriction is aimed at the postelection donation which has long been a significant factor in campaigns. and it is "bad money" that rides on the winners new office. the power of the purse has become the most undisciplined. uncontrolled and irresponsible force in politics. our method of financing campaigns has done more to demean the practitioners of politics and to discredit the political system in the eyes of the public than anything else. therefore. the burden of responsibility for a clean and open campaign must fall on the candidates themselves. thus. under the amendment i have proposed. each candidate would be required to manage his campaign with utmost care and candor. the candidate must ige influence seekers and clandestine charades in favor of winning the confidence and contributions of individual voters on the basis of personal qualification and a capacity to represent and govern. with the full financial story of a campaign told before the election. the candidate is fully accountable for the propriety and handling of his campaign finances. perhaps the light of public scrutiny will diminish the role of money as a corrupting force in political campaigns. truly the inherent strength in our democratic process lies in the free exercises of the informed judgment of the american electorate.
point  5. i k the argument is going to be made. how can you anticipate what is going to happen in that last 2week period. well. the bill provides for that. the candidate can go ahead and budget for a particular amount for newspaper advertisements. he is allowed to go ahead and spend it. should something occur. like shifting tactics. he is allowed to go ahead and make the expenditure if something happens. he does  have to spend it. but when the public gets that report. it gets a full picture. again. speaking from the practical side. how many of us sitting here in the senate chamber would give testimony that last minute expenditures in a campaign have done us any good. i k in the campaigns i have run both for congress and the senate we started out in the beginning with plans for our campaigns. they change to some extent in the middle and at the end. and then in the last minutes some of our well wishers will run in and say. "hey. you have to do thus and so. you have to spend money in this area." really. when we heed those requests. they have  gained us one more vote. we have satisfied the requests of some well wishers. so we are  going to lose anything by cutting ourselves off at the time period of 2 weeks prior to an election. so that is it in briefa cutoff point 2 weeks before the election. a complete report on the role money played in the election. a selfpolicing procedure whereby we are  going to have deficits hanging over our heads for months and sometimes for years. in my mind there is question that it will reduce the role that money will play in any particular campaign. there is question in my mind. as i think we have all seen. that probably the single most corrupting force in american politics is money. any time we can cut down its influence. any time we can get it out as a matter of public kledge is all to the good. this amendment accomplishes both of those objectives.
. let me say. first of all. that i am  deeply concerned by the argument of the senator from rhode island. i commend him and commend the committee. the senator from nevada and the rest. i think we all have the same objective in mind. it is a question of how we get there. the difficulty is that this matter of a limitation i have disagreed with as a conceptual matter for a long time. because x number of dollars n connecticut can do so much. and the same number of dollars spent in idaho can do perhaps a lot more or a lot less. but let me go over and respond to the points that have been raised as far as the cutoff is concerned. as i have pointed out. you can go ahead and budget for x number of dollars in your final accounting for the last 2 weeks. you do  have to spend the money. but you can go ahead and budget for it. second. as far as the limitation is concerned. i have discussed that with the senator from rhode island. and i have pointed out that we are asked to budget a year at a time. right here on the floor of the u.s. senate. for the governments purposes. my gosh. i think we should certainly be able to do the same thing for ourselves.
i thank the senator from kentucky. i think it is especially useful to listen to the words of the senator from kentucky and understand that simply because he has some reservations about the bill. as indeed i do. it does  mean we are against reform. we just have to start to do our homework in this country. and start facing the fact that we are  about to demagogue this issue. we all understand the need for reform. but what i am trying to do is come out with something intelligent. that is worthy of the greatest political process ever kn to man. rather than just slap a bandaid on to try to make everyone feel good. and then find out we have created something far worse than that which we already have. which is bad egh. and one is defending it in any way. i think. as we have listened to the senator from kentucky. we have realized that he has pointed out the pitfalls.  because he has anything to gain from private contributors. but because he understands that if indeed there is going to be a cleaning process. and if indeed the voters are to be given a choice. the type of reform we are discussing has to come to pass. otherwise the american people will believe the situation is reform when in fact it will be havoc. so i commend the senator for his comments. because i k of his dedication to getting this mess cleaned up. it does  make any difference whether it is his head or my head. we think that we are going to do things right. i think that is basically what the senator from kentucky is saying. it is  a question that either of us are going to rely on campaign funds from our own states. that has hing to do with the debate on this floor. as i said before. it is  simply a case that those who are for the bill as written are for reform. and those who are  are against it. that is  the case at all. it has got to be clear. from every poll that has been taken. whether in my state or across the nation. that the american people do  necessarily want to be restricted to the choice of democrats or republicans. otherwise. if the republicans are doing so badly and the democrats so well right . why  just join the democratic party. the fact is that we have gone through two administrations. one of each party. where clearly an excess of power has been turned against the best interests of the people of this nation. and they have every reason to have a distrust of both parties. why should we be subsidized.  or senator or representative. two weeks before the election. everything should be right in place. and then people will k exactly the role the money plays. it will be a selfpolicing measure. which should do a great favor to all of us in politics. and should go a long way toward eliminating the horrendous deficits which occur in the course of campaigns. and which. again. too many of us spend too much time on. after we are elected. point  2: it calls for one committee. and eliminates the laundering of funds. in other words. in the case of a personal contribution to one committee. the candidates name sticks to that contribution. even though the contribution goes from one pot to aher. we will  get any laundering of funds. it allows a candidatei am doing this from memory 10.000 in personal money. which brings me to the business of deficits. according to the bill as i have written it. you are  allowed to run on a deficit. or to put it this way. if you have $10.000. use it any way you want to. you can have the deficit any way if you want to. but if there are problems. they will be kn. and your breaking of the law will be kn to the voters before the election. i would doubt that anyone would want to find themselves in violation of the law which would be kn to the public 2 weeks before the election. again there is aher practical reason for setting this deadline at 2 weeks before election. i will speak for myself so that one else will "sit on my head." but i k that a good portion of the money i received for my successful campaign in 1970 came to me after i was elected. that i do  consider to be much of a testimony to lowell weicker. it is a testimony to the seat which he has won. to the power which he has achieved through an election win.
better let me finish what i am going to say first. what i am talking about is a legal contribution. that comes to all who are elected. but which comes after the election is over and is then put into our campaign. that is wrong. we k it is wrong. to believe in a man or woman and what they stand for is 6ne thing. but to give money afterward. that is merely going ahead and playing the seat. that is  right. it does  lead to healthy politics. but in my case onefifth. or fully onesixth. i believe. of the funds were raised after i was elected. i do  think i am too far off the mark in that situation. that is why the cutoff date in this legislation is 2 weeks before election. you can spend money on those things already committed. but you can go ahead and make any new commitments. you can go ahead and collect any money. except during those 60 days. which is what we are talking about46 days of fundraisingthe full 60 days being that which applies to campaign spending. let me comment on aher point brought out by the distinguished senator from kentucky. he remarked on the campaign bill we passed last year which  sits over in the house. many ideas have come to pass since then. as a matter of fact. my bill presented to the rules committee then did  include the 60day provision which i present to the senate today. what i am saying here is that we need time to generate the best of everyones thinking and  just to grab the first solution that comes along. let me review if i can. in case i have left anything out. that section 3 of the substitute amendments amends the "limitations on contributions and expenditures" that are presently in existence. the proposed law would be as follows: first. contributions. or even an arrangement for contributions prior to the first tuesday in september. second. expenditures on contracts before the first tuesday in september. cash over $50. third. a cutoff on money 2 weeks before the ember electiona candidate can. however. "budget for" his anticipated expenses for the last 2 weeks of the campaign. fourth. more than $10.000 from the candidates personal funds. fifth. deficits. a deficit would be a criminal violation. and would be kn. by the opponent as well as the voters. 2 weeks before election day. to incur a deficit would be to be on public record as in violation of the law. and having to explain this to voters you are asking to give you high public trustfor the protection of creditors. the deficit could be paid off in a proceeding similar to bankruptcy. under the supervision of the comptroller general.
i thank the distinguished senator from minnesota. i would say this: i. in wise. have the background or expertise of the distinguished senator from minnesota in the legislative field as it relates to education. admittedly there might be aspects that fall short. as far as my amendment is concerned. i have already said it is  just a matter of money. obviously principles and programs are involved. but i do k that everyone will have a choice. in this legislation. in that they can opt for inequality of educational opportunity or can opt for taxes which might improve conditions which influence busing. but one option that is longer available is doing hing. on the one hand. or telling the courts what they can or can do. that is  a solution for anything. the senator from minnesota ks that as well as i do. what i have tried to do is confront the senate as well as the american people with the fact that there is cheap way to really improve equality of educational opportunity. i have proposed a legislative alternative to busing which says. "ok. let us get in here. . and see what we can do by the route of additional compensatory funds. while at the same time admitting that obviously there are other factors involved. that the program is wrapped up in the question of housing and other aspects as well." i am sure this must come to pass. i am sure that the court would love it if they did  have to rule on a single case. i am sorry to say that. as far as the administration is concerned. the only thing i have heard is a lot of rhetoric trying to steam up the american people that they ought to be against busing. i wish they would tell me how that will educate one single child in this country that is already being deprived. it may sound strange to stand on this floor and advocate taxes. but i am tired of members on both sides standing here and saying. "we are going to have housing. we are going to have transportation. we are going to have education." and then saying. "new taxes. we will get it all out of the defense budget." i do  see any way of doing what needs to be done in all these fields unless we raise the taxes to do it. that is the point of this amendment as much as anything else: to say that this body has the guts to face the problem. and one aspect of the problem is to make sure that we have the money to assure that each child will have the educational opportunity.
i would say to the distinguished senator from maine. and i do  like to put myself in opposition to him. as i k of the very sound work he has done in the committee. as indeed have his other colleagues. but the fact is. the point i am trying to make is that much is embodied in the statement accompanying the legislation as in the legislation itself. we sit here and wring our hands over this busing issue and. really. the only ones to sufferwe are making such slow progressare the schoolchil-. dren themselves. one wants to get into an unpleasant solution to the problem. one is willing to go ahead and face up to it. i happen to think that. yes. there are some members of this body that k the time has come that. with complete candor. we must do what we say we will do. insofar as these issues are concerned. there are senators within this body who will stand up and say. yes. there is such thing as a cheap price for equality. but that is what we are confronted with. we are talking about catching up with equality. equality that is still denied. by anyones definition of "with all deliberate speed." we are going at this thing too slowly. we should arrive at a positive resolution of the problem. rather than dumping the matter in the courts and getting mad at the courts when we do  like what they are doing. if we wait on the administration. they will be demagoging the busing issue to death in hopes of garnering votes. but i am telling the senator from maine. who is as much concerned as i am as to the number of children 20 years later who are still in the situation of inequality. that one thing we have to do ahead of anything else is to establish the fact that we mean business. we will take some unpopularity on our shoulderssome of us have already done thatand it will be tough on everyone. one likes taxes. one likes to advocate taxes. but one likes busing. apparently. either. so what i am trying to do is to say that there has to be aher solution other than doing hing or just sitting there and disparaging the courts. with some reticence. as i recognize the fine record of the distinguished senator from maine and the majority of the members of the committeeboth republicans and.democrats. i must ask for a vote on this amendment. as i have asked for it. because if one else will show any guts around here. at least let the senate vote on it in some form. we should  follow the usual course of advocating more money and then going back to our constituents to say. "we did the job as a matter of principle." rather we should be able to say " we advocated more money but i also advocated the taxes in order to raise the money to pay for it." i think. with all due respect to the distinguished senator from maine and the committee. i should like to allow this amendment to go to a vote.
fine. i will try  to take too much more time. i would agree that there is question about the fact that possibly some savings can be achieved through tax reform. and i think that has to be done. maybe it is true we can hitch up our belts a little bit here and there. but the impression is always given by the politicians that this is the way we will acquire programs that are worth something in this country. and it just is  so. it can happen. that may be the promise. but we could use. to put in decent mass transit facilities bus and rail. $30 billion. in the state of connecticut alone. that is how far behind we are. and you can imagine what would happen if we apply that standard to the rest of the country. for some reason or other. we look to the federal reserve board. or wonder what the comptroller of the currency is doing. or what the secretary of the treasury is doing. come on. we have all got to start to look at ourselves. there is only so much that comes to pass because of our productivity. if you will. it is rather because of the taxes we pay. it is  something that can be manipulated or judged. we are either going to have to work or sacrifice in order to produce programs that meet these various goals. all i have tried to point out here this morning is that i have researched very carefully. and i admit. on the public record. i might add. that the senator from west virginia is correct. there is official democratic position on this matter. however. i would say some of the major figures in the senators party have spoken rather loudly on this point. and the point comes across. and i have a feeling that maybe this will increase in its volume. and that the democratic position is as i have stated. albeit only enunciated by a few persons at this time. but i mean what i say. i k the traditions of the republican party: let us play it tight. and do hing. one of the traditions of the democratic party. when we get into a position like this. has been to call for a tax cut. hoping that will solve everything. i reiterate that i do  fully share the tradition of either party. i feel that unless we are willing to pay for it. we should  be engaged in these great national goals that i have mentioned here on this floor. quite frankly. the investment of tax dollars in these programs welfare or handout programshas been something that affects children. grandparents. miities. in other words. when we are all through. it affects all of us. only if we. indeed. invest in the other fellow do we ourselves derive some actual. practical. ecoic benefit. as i said earlier in the example of space. i can understand why america does  seem to understand the benefits to be derived from space. because those in space do  interest themselves in housing. they do  interest themselves in transportation. they do  interest themselves in health. it is the same old story. as in talking to homebuilders in connecticut. they are in the private sector of homebuilding. my concern has been for housing. periodboth public and private housing. there is going to be a tradeoff in public versus private housing. if the whole area of housing is to get off the ground. they can be separated. that is the point i am trying to make here today. i admittedly make this in a partisan way. it is good to have the issues laid out on the table concerning anyone who advocates a tax cut at this time. a member of my staff turned to me and said. "in january you voted for kennedys amendment which is in effect a form of tax cut." that is right. i did. i was wrong. yesterday i proposed a surtax because there is question in my mind that we should be doing these things and we can do them and do them right unless we pay for them. if we want to end the recession--call it what you will. we must do it in this fashion. rather than by gimmickry. to get the nation on the move again
the distinguished senator from nebraska refers to the increase in lawlessness. and so forth. how do we deal. since these matters have come to our attention of late. with the lawless elements within the federal bureau of investigation. within the cia. within military intelligence. within the secret service. within the internal revenue service. how do we deal with lawless elements within those government agencies.
. today i am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from connecticut. senator risicoff. in introducing legislation to amend the internal reveune code of 1954 to assure taxexempt status for state lotteries. section 4401 of the internal revenue code of 1954 imposes a 10percent tax on the amount of wagers made. to be paid by anyone engaged in the business of accepting wagers. including any person conducting a lottery. a related occupational tax of $50 per year is imposed on each person who is liable for tax under section 4401 or who is engaged in rejune 17. 1974 coin ceiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable. in 1963 new hampshire became the first state in recent history to establish a state lottery. in order to exempt new hampshires lottery from these taxes. congress. in 1965. added as section 4402 (3) of the code. an exemption for stateconducted sweepstakes. wagering pools. or lotteries. the exemption was drafted narrowly to encompass the new hampshire type of lottery. the provision of particular concern is the restriction that ultimate winners must be determined "by the results of a horse race." it is this anachronistic language which this bill seeks to redefine. since the appearance of the new hampshire lottery. eight other states have established and are operating lotteries. namely. connecticut. maryland. massachusetts. michigan. new jersey. new york. pennsylvania. and rhode island. four other states have either authorized or are investigating the feasibility of lottery operations: maine. delaware. illis. and ohio. however. the lotteries which have been established since 1965. including a revised version of the new hampshire lottery. differ substantially in the manner in which they operate from the form of lottery which was made exempt by congress in 1965. although most states use a format which gives the appearance that the ultimate winners are detelrmined on the basis of a horse race. in point of fact in every case. ultimate winners are determined by an official drawing. consequently. the lotteries as conducted do  satisfy the prerequisite for exemption under section 4402(3). it is my understanding that the internal revenue service may soon rule against the state lotteries in the near future. thus making the lotteries liable for the 10percent excise tax and lottery sales agents liable to pay a special $50 tax. in a letter dated april 29. 1974. from treasury assistant secretary frederick w. hickman to chairman wilbur mills of the house ways and means committee. the treasury department stated that it was in favor of exempting state lotteries from the imposition of wagering taxes. the treasury department favors the exemption of state lotteries from the imposition of wagering taxes. such an exemption is consistent with the administrations program of revenue sharing which is intended to provide the states with greater revenues. therefore. given the support of the treasury department and the administration. as well as the clear intent of congress in previously amending the internal revenue code to exempt the first state lottery. it would seem imperative that congress should immediately clarify the tax exempt status of the state lotteries. i urge my colleagues to give this important amendment favorable and expeditious consideration. by mr. biden:
i want to respond. that in way did i mean to impute either to the senator or his committee any acceptance of the matters kn as watergate. the senators record speaks for itself: a dedication of civil liberties and an opposition to those matters unearthed by watergate. i suppose what concerns me is that i find.  only with my colleagues but also with persons everywhere in this country. that they feel the resignation that occurred last week resolved all the problems raised by our factfinding mission. they did  resolve any problems at all. all the facts that relate to the internal revenue service. the facts that relate to wiretaps. the facts that relate to bank records. these matters can only be resolved legislatively. so i get worried about whether we are going to keep our legislative task in clear view. or just pack up and go home. because. believe me if we did the latter then the whole point of watergate has been missed. that is why i rise in support of this amendment. and why in the consideration of the white house personnel bill i tacked on the restriction regarding access to irs records. why in the treasury appropriation bill that amendment which insists on ice given to bank customers when their records are being gone through by law enforcement agencies. these issues have to be resolved legislatively. i realize the proper procedures to be followed. the senator from rhode island is correct. it is far better to be done through the committee on the judiciary. but the issue must stay alive because the tendency is to forget and that can happen. because if it does. then de facto we will have accepted these abuses and de facto they become the law of the land. so i merely wish to advise my colleagues there are times. i am sure. when they will say. "he is being harded on this subject." but unless it is done we all run the risk of being part of a constitutional coverup. rather than being part of the legislative reform of these abuses.
. this is a very exciting plan. i congratulate the management and directors of amtrak for developing and pushing it. i would only urge the department of transportation and the office of management and budget as well as my colleagues in the senate and house  to stand in the way of the new spirit of ination which appears to be sweeping amtrak. in order that the new amtrak plan may be given the widest possible distribution. i ask unanimous consent that it be printed in full in the record.
 require tax return information to fulfill his official duties. he may make a personal request in writing for such material from the irs. in tabling the conference report last week. the senate stood firm in support of reform necessary to restore the integrity of our government. with the house playing parliamentary games and the administration waffling on needed reform. let the senate  reaffirm its commitment to the fundamental principles of constitutional democracy. let us  for the third time in as many weeks. express our support for restricting white house tampering with confidential tax returns.
i wish i could respond in the affirmative to the distinguished senator from wisconsin. as he said. there is just difference between he and i as to the substantive aspects of what is being offered. as he said. it is a matter of timing. but it is exactly that timing which i wish to address myself to. look. the elections are over. we have had egh electioneering. we have had egh recesses. we have had egh foreign trips around here. while all of this has been going on. we continue to go ahead and slide further down the line when it comes to jobs. inflation continues to soar. some day. somebody in washington. d.c.. had better do something. there is always an excuse as to why there is action. either in the sense of attacking inflation or the recession. here we are. what better time. we talk about timing. psychologically. what better time to give the country a lift to say that we have come back to work. and we have come back to work on the problems of this nation. certainly. two of those problems are our housing and recessionunemployment.
we -say we have an energy crisis. yet the resolution of that crisis. aside from whatever is done visavis the restriction of oil and the implementation of rationing. relies on creating decent mass transit systems in order that we lower our consumption of oil. the money allocated in this bill is  even adequate for 1 year for the state of connecticut. yet that is what is given to the entire united states of america. we say that we are in a period of recession. -that we want jobs. you will be able to get a bill for public service jobs through this body. but why wait and come forth with that when you have the opportunity -to create jobs in a housing bill such as we discussed yesterday. -or in a mass -transit bill such as we have before .us today.. i say these are extraordinary times. so business as usual solutions are  adequate. the funding in this bill is  adequate -for any of the areas mentioned.  1. which is the primary concern. the funding is  adequate for building decent mass transit. it is  adequate by the dots own figures. by the conference of mayors own figures. by our own eyeballing -of the situation in our states. it is inadequate. we accept this bill under the threat of a veto and because the bill in the house is -bottled up and can get out any other way. let us understand the funding level in this bill for what it is. it is inadequate. it is inadequate for helping us resolve our -energy crisis. it is inadequate relative to the job .situation. it is inadequate for these extraordinary times. so. . i would hope that we do  consider this finished business for thenext 6 years. this -is .getting back to the question i initially referred to. as i said. we would  have .anything before us if it were  for the senator from texas and the senator from new jersey. i..do want the -assurances. the positive assurances. that this is  put to bed  for 6 years. that we have the right to come back and review our commitment in this area.
i thank the senator from th carolina. what this does is attack the confidentiality of our income tax returns. it is as simple as that. with my amendmentthe relevant information is available. however. as far as the individual return and identity of the return is concerned.  it is  available to the census bureau. and should  be. i am delighted my amendment is acceptable to the senator from th carolina. i hope we can get the point home to the people downtown. i file my tax return for the purposes of collection of taxes and hing else. this amendment does that. the generalized information is available. but  the specific return.
in response to the distinguished senator from montana. i say to those who inquire as to why the situation has become worse during the past year that it is because we have done hing. the senator from montana and i are standing in exactly the same position. talking about exactly the same issue 1 year later. and action has been taken. it is good for members of his party and my party to talk about the good things in life. such as tax rebates. but i do  see how we can climb out of our present difficulties unless there is also a little hard news and a little sacrifice.
in response to. the distinguished senator from montana. i say two things: first of all. i agree with and i am glad to hear him comment as the business of the tax rebates. i do  think tax rebaters are the answer. either and i think what he is focusing on is so important. it is that sacrifice has to be involved here. the traditional political responses are probably what has put us into our present predicament. and certainly our holding to them will  get us out of our predicament. it is my understanding. and i can speak for the administration. that. yes. the additional tariff will raise the price of everything associated with oil just gasoline. but heating oils and all the products associated with oil. in fact. it will be an inflationary measure in and of itself.
i thank the distinguished senator from montana. i think he has responded to a fair question that the president of the united states asked. which was: never mind congress giving me standby authority. let congress speak for itself. let congress go ahead and toe up to the mark and vote for the various solutions rather than giving methe presidenta variety of alternatives. the senator from montana has spoken very clearly as a member of this body. i do. too. because the problems of inflation and recession that we are  involved with are  a new england problem. it is  a middle america problem. it is  a black problem. it is an american problem and america must move together to solve our energy crisis. this nations story is a story of the majority. rather than shifting the burden over to the miity. accepting that burden as their own. there has been solution to the problem of inflation that is caused by highpriced oil. and the solution. it seems to me. plainly lies in the reduction of consumption. one year of voluntarism has been 1 year wasted. and has represented many hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.
what we have attempted to do in this legislation is to purposely be flexible.  pin a plan on the president. we said it has to be mandatory. it has to apply across the board and then. it seems to me. it is up to the president and congress to work out the details of the plan. but obviously thereare areas such as commercial use. agricultural use. and so forth. where the emphasis has to continue in order that so productivity can be maintained.
i appreciate the senators explanation of the purposes and intent of this provision written in on the house side. i would like to clarify a few points. however. existing law. as the senator states. does require that these trust fund tax moneys that have been paid by a tenant to any landlord be paid over to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction. does this amendment deal only with those funds which are specifically earmarked for taxes.
reserving the right to object. and i will  object. i just want to make one comment on that suggestion of the distinguished senator. and those who want to vote sometime. this senate had a tax package before it with the introduction of the amendment of mr. biden and mr. bumpers this aftern. some 10 hours ago we started to discuss taxes and unanimous consents. we spent the whole aftern on everything but the actual bill. i can appreciate wanting to go ahead and limit debate right . but i think that would have been a far more appropriate motion had it been made on monday. i am  going to ask for a rollcall on my amendment. i do  intend to presume on the time of the members. but i think it is a sad commentary that when we have legislation before us that. in fact. we only spend 10 hours of the time debating the subject matter before us. we have discussed everything else under the sun and i think the unanimousconsent request for the time limitation comes after everybody has had his crack at this thing and. actually.  we are on the only amendments that have any real bearing on the subject matter before the senate.
i thank the senator. i reiterate that it seems to me that congressand. i might add. the president of the united stateshas  asked for any sacrifice in the area of energy. until that sacrifice is requested. we are  going to solve the energy crisis. therefore. we are  going to attack the principal cause of inflation. we in congress have  asked for that sacrifice insofar as straightening the ecoic ship is concerned. we have sat here with a package of tax rebates and tax cuts that could only serve to weaken the ecoy further. i think the time has come for a little straight talk. if  tonight. but sooner or later. we are going to be held accountable for our leadership. so far as i am concerned. that leadership has been existent. politics has been as usual. therefore. i imagine that the recession will continue as usual. and the inflation as usual: and the energy crisis which started in the fall of 1973and hing has been done on thatwill continue as usual. it is a pessimistic e. but sooner or later we will put to our task. and maybe we will respond.
. i take this opportunity to join with senator chiles in sponsoring this legislation that will overhaul the $115 billion a year contracts and grants program. the federal grants and cooperative agreement act will. for the first time. set governmentwide criteria for the use of legal instruments to carry out federal/federal transactions for acquisition of property. services. and furnishing assistance. past experiences regarding these practices illustrates a long history of waste and ineffectual spending of tax dollars for procurement and assistance programs. this measure disciplines executive agencies in their selection of contracts. grants. and cooperative agreements and will clear the air of uncertainty so rampant in this area. the need for discipline is apparent when one looks at the emous growth of expenditures for federal assistance programs since 1950. federal grants to state and local governments have increased from a little over $2 billion in fiscal year 1950 to over $55 billion for fiscal year 1975. comparable expenditures for procurement of property and services point to a need for this legislation . the intent of this legislation is clear in that it takes steps to control the mechanisms behind the huge. annual expenditures of federal budget funds. it is time the congress put an end to the fragmentation. confusion. and complexity that abound in federal assistance and procurement programs. this will  only save costs. but it provides a new direction towards the elimination of needless redtape. hopefully. the senate will see fit to take expeditious action on this bill as it did last session. with ecoic woes plaguing the entire nation. the congress must act  to eliminate inefficiency and mismanagement from these programs that total onethird of the entire federal budget. by mr. mcintyre:
. the thought occurred to me when the distinguished senator from kansas mentioned exemption. that in connecticut. and i am sure the case is similar in other states. whenever we pass laws and have exemptions they usually relate to the least powerful elements of our society. for example. in our sales tax we exempt clothing. we exempt food. we exempt those things that are literally the basis of life to those who have to struggle over it. this is great legislation for the senate. we exempt the powerful. that is what this is all about. it is a different concept. though it is a rather interesting one for the country. we are  exempting items that relate to the poor or to those who are in need in terms of health. nutrition. or what have you. these are the most powerful elements of our society that we are  exempting. that is the difference in philosophy as between this legislation and what has usually been done legislatively both at the state and federal levels
in a humorous way the issue we are talking about was commented on in mr. oliphants cartoon in the washington star. by showing an irs man walking to the door and saying to the lady: congratulations. you have qualified for a rebate. but. first. a few questions about your political affiliations. sex life. and drinking habits. we are right back at position  1. let us  engage in this practice ourselves. and let us pass this legislation to make sure that the members of the executive branch and the agencies do  have that power to come in and. in effect. take advantage of facts supplied by the taxpayer for the purpose of collecting taxes. and hing else. i ice in the executive order it is stated: with a view to determining the ecoy of the government. that is  why i submitted my tax return. it was for the purpose of collecting taxes and hing else. let us keep it that way and. in any event. i would hope that the committee on government operations would rence its request for this particular information. at least by way of setting an example.
i do have to point this out: one of our jobs today. and it is a very difficult one. is to try to convince the american public to believe that techogy and science must move ahead. the senator ks there are those who oppose nuclear energy. jet engines. and everything. they do  even want to try to have science become compatible with nature. it is a very difficult job to move science ahead in this country today. we will have this kind of thing taking place. and the opposition will grow and grow. and those who want the frontiers of science pushed forward are going to be overwhelmed by the rhetoric of demagoguery of extremists who want us to sit back and do hing. i believe in moving our scientific and techogical capabilities ahead on many fronts. but i realize that this is a doubleedged proposition. and to vote stringent standards for ourselves and  for foreign nations will only provide food to the demogogs who would like to get us back to the stone age.
. today i am introducing the federal taxpayer privacy act of 1975a bill to protect the confidentiality of tax returns. on january 17. i introduced. with the support of over onethird of my colleagues. legislation. s. 199. to restrict the disclosure of confidential tax information. the bill i am introducing today refiects improvements in that original proposal based upon the testimony presented before the senate finance and house ways and means committee and my continued discussions with experts. it is my understanding that the house ways and means committee will consider this important question next week in their markup of tax reform legislation. an identical proposal is being offered by my distinguished colleague. congressman jerry litton. at this point. i would like to explain the major provisions in the bill.
. as we proceed with consideration and debate on senate resolution 9. i suggest that we should keep in mind the business of the senate which will follownamely. s. 5. the government in the sunshine act. when we turn to s. 5. the senate will consider whether or  to require that multiheaded federal agencies open their proceedings to the public. s. 5 would mandate openness on the part of these federal agencies. it would require that the agencies open meetings and discussions regarding the conduct of agency business. deliberations on pending business. and the disposition of business to the purview of the public. most importantly. s. 5 would establish a standard whereby open government would become the rule and closed government the exception. the passage of this important legislative initiative is just one step toward increasing the publics access to their government. however. it is an important step toward bringing the government closer to the people and. thereby. achieving a more responsive and more accountable government. before we turn to the business of establishing a new standard of conduct on the part of federal agencies. it is only fitting that we first consider our own rules of senate procedure and thereby put our own house in order. presently. senate rules require that all markups and other voting sessions of committees will be closed unless the committee votes to open or unless the committee adopts its own general "open" meeting rule. the current standard. therefore. presumes closed meetings and places the burden upon committees to openthus. fostering the suspicion that all committee decisions are the result of back room deals. as originally introduced. senate resolution 9 would have established a standard which presumes "open" meetings for all senate committees. except in circumstances where a committee considers a particularly. sensitive subject matter. the original version of senate resolution 9 would have changed our current standard from "closed" to "open" and would have gone further to enumerate the specific instances in which a meeting could be closed. we  have before us a rules committee substitute to senate resolution 9 which would negate any uniform standard of conduct for senate committees. this substitute provides that a standing committee of the senate must hold open meetings. however. the loophole establishes that a committee may vote to close a meeting "because of the nature of the matter to be considered" or. that any committee may adopt rules specifically prescribing a different procedure. "to protect its own needs." the substitute further proposes to repeal the "sunshine amendment" to the congressional budget and impoundment act which required that our own senate budget committee hold open meetings. this substitute does  at all conform to the intent of sunshine in government. the adoption of the rules committee proposal would conceivably eliminate what little sunshine we have today in the conduct of senate committee business and would institute a dual standard of accountability on the part of this body. hing illustrates this more than the unfortunate choice of language by the rules committee in writing the "escape clause" from open government which would allow an individual committee to adopt rules of procedure "to protect its own needs." there is a vague reference to the public interest. but. here is there a reference to the needs of the public. at best. this language represents an unfortunate mistake. at worst. it places the needs and convenience of committees above the needs of the public by whom we are elected and to whom we remain accountable. the very essence of our form of government is accountability. secrecy is fatal to accountability. secrecy is a main contributor to rumors. leaks. misconstrued .facts. and distrusts of government officials. we are all keenly aware of the national trauma from which we are attempting to recover. we k all too well that the public has  forgotten the breach of faith and the halftruths generated about the operations of their government and the conduct of federal officials. the fallout from watergate remains with us today. the net result has been a pervasive lack of faith in the integrity of our governmental processes. in the collective mind of the public. the congress fares better than the executive branch in this regard. in fact. in a survey taken in midsummer. pollster louis harris reported that only 18 percent of the public gives the congress a positive rating for inspiring confidence in government--only 18 percent. one of the key criticisms of the congress is that it is cumbersome and unresponsive. the low ratings have been attributed to a lack of public kledge about the workings of the congress. if there is a lack of public kledge about the way we conduct the publics business. we are the guilty parties. through senate rules and procedures which maintain that committees may operate behind closed doors to protect their own interests. we have fostered the criticism that the congress is unresponsive. as the elected representatives of the public. we bear every responsibility to open the processes by which we make our decisionswhether these processes be committee markups or joint housesenate conference committees. only then can we be held fully accountable for our actions. only when we have removed. to the greatest extent possible. the veil of secrecy which shrouds committee actions will the public k the extent. quality. and integrity of their representation. we  have an opportunity to perform an important service for our constituents. before we go forward and decide whether we will require a high standard of visibility and accountabilityon the part of federal agencies--we must decide whether the senate willabide as high a standardor whether we will adopt a lesser standard and. thus. place the interests of the public subservient to our own. as for myself. i urge that the senate approve a standard of open government and apply it to committee meetings and conference committees alike. to do so. we must first reject the rules committee substitute amendment.
. i rise to oppose this amendment. the arguments presented are different from those that could be presented on behalf of any of the hundreds of federal agencies. either we are going to have a bill that brings all government out into the open or we are . i have been through this exemption exercise once before. in the consumer protection bill. when we exempted labor and the electronic broadcast media. and so on down the line. that is the reason why we have credibility as a congress. we enunciate these great. sweeping. broad principles to the american people and then start to nibble at them and carve out our own exemption. whether it is for an executive agency or for our political party or our state or ourselves. all of a sudden. the people get the feeling that we are legislating for everybody else but  for ourselves. i completely oppose this amendment. i think the doings of the federal reserve board are as much a part of the peoples business as anything else. for a long time. i have felt that too much has been going on behind closed doors. too much going on in arthur burns mind. this business of making arthur burns and the federal reserve board looking sacrosanct is great. until we get into difficulty. and then we start to yell for scalps. even though we are focusing on the ecoy and give added &5327 impetus to the federal reserve board. that is fine. but i will  go along. because of these times. with an exemption for that board. i think the ecoy of this country is very much the business of the american people. insofar as encouraging free and open discussion is concerned. openness in our government has  inhibited free and frank discussion. in fact. i believe that if we had had freer and franker discussion by a variety of ecoists. we would  have gotten into the difficulties we are in . so that argument does  hold. so far as sensitive material and the rest are concerned. that is provided for in the bill. this happens to be one man who does  like to share his powers with the american people. just as. for a long time. senators did  want to share their powers with the american people. it is  our government. it is  arthur burns government. it is the peoples government. we serve them. can you imagine having somebody serve you and your  king what they are doing. we serve. arthur burns serves. we are  the ones telling other people what to do.
s budget request for the next fiscal year is $260 milliona reduction of $70 million. thus. the caas are facing a cruel onetwo punchan increase in the local share and a decrease in federal assistance. the legislation we have introduced today will restore the federal/local relationship that has existed since 1967. it will allow caas to continue to effectively administer socially beneficial programs. i urge my colleagues to follow the houses lead and enact this remedial legislation.
ial campaign of 1976. the amendment calls for the repeal of the tax checkoff system after taxable years 1978. and the termination of public financing effective january 1. 1979 unless the 95th congress reexamines and reenacts the public financing concept.
. in the interest of full financial disclosure. i ask unanimous consent that the joint tax return for 1975 and the joint statement of assets and liabilities of my wife and myself. as of december 31. 1975. be printed in the record.
. i am pleased to join with senators mus=e and roth in cosponsoring s. 2925. the government ecoy and spending reform act of 1976. this bill would establish a 4year cycle for the review and evaluation of federal programs by congress and the executive branch with the help of the government accounting office and the congressional budget office. through s. 2925. the congress and the executive branch will be charged with conducting a zero base budget review of all federal programs instead of the hodgepodge. limited. budget review that exists . zero base review is a new budgeting technique which will require all federal programs to justify their existence before they are reauthorized. such a review will require the identification of costs and objectives of programs and evaluations of the effectiveness of these programs. furthermore. s. 2925 will establish a procedure for eliminating inactive and overlapping federal programs. clearly. zero base review will be a large step toward bringing government accountability back to the people. it is my belief that in the year 1976. america has reached the watershed of an era. the 1960s gave the united states some of the most inative. techogical. and compassionate human service programs of the century. if we are to continue and extend these programs. we are going to have to do some house cleaning. for example. there are presently close to a thousand federal domestic assistance programs. the duplicative efforts and the mismanagement of some domestic programs serve  only to hurt the taxpayer but. more importantly. the recipients of the program benefits. efficient use of overhead costs could be used to reach more program recipients. so instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water. let us. the legislative and executive branches of this government. begin to exercise more effective and efficient oversight of federal programs. i do  think it will come as a surprise to any politician in 1976. that the american people are disenchanted with the workings of their government. a recent harris poll showed that 72 percent of the public feels that they do  get good value from their tax dollars. that statistic is a clear message from the heartland to washington "to clean up its act." i believe that s. 2925 will be the beginning of that ong road back from public dissatisfaction and lack of confidence with the new dirty word "washington." this legislation seeks to achieve what every government should strive foreffective and efficient use of the taxpayers money.
ial campaign activities in december of 1974. the bill was voted to be reported by the government operations committee on april 9. 1976. a detailed report is being prepared and the committee expects to report the bill to the senate on monday. may 10. there undoubtedly will be a referral to at least one other cominittee. maybe two. on the matter of tax privacy. in the 93d congress over 18 months. ago the weickerlitton bill was introduced to protect the confidentiality of tax returns. since that time this legislation has received strong editorial support and has been sponsored by over half the house and over onethird of the senate members. extensive senate hearings have been held by the finance committee and the house ways and means committee. congressman litton and i have testified on the following days: april 28. 1975. before the senate finance committee on administration of the irs code. on july 10. 1975. before the house ways and means subcommittee on the irs. january 28. 1976. before the full ways and means committee. on march 14. 1976. before the privacy commission. bills are still pending before the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee. the finance committee has begun 5 weeks of markup sessions on tax reform legislation. and the joint committee on internal revenue taxation staff has prepared a background paper on tax privacy. there is a possibility that the finance committee may take it up before the end of may. however. there is a fear of the staff that the privacy issue will be laid aside because it is too controversial and there is  egh time to consider it. so there you have the status report as to the real watergate reform  the federal election campaign act amendments that is referred to in the rules committee by the chairman and others as being watergate reform when. indeed the watergate committee specifically recommended against public financing. there is the status. i ask unanimous consent at this time that there be printed in the record at this point an editorial of the washington post of sunday. may 2. 1976.
. to pay particular compliments to the majority leader and to the chairman of the senate committee on government operations . were it  for these two men. i have doubt that senate resolution 400 would  be on the floor today. the senate majority leader. who is  a johnnycomelately. is  riding a bandwagon. but. rather. foresaw the dangers 20 years ago. had his advice been followed. there would have been necessity for the rather sensational revelations of the past few years. as he retires from a fruitful and a very positive career in public service. i want to pay the credit that is due. should this pass and this idea become law. then. indeed. it should be dedicated to this man. because ody has been further out front on the issue than mike mansfield and my colleague from the state of connecticut. this particular idea was one of several right after the watergate. over the course of 3 years i have seen those ideas of watergate reform. tax privacy. intelligence oversight. nibbled to death by the power ltructure. either in the congress or the executive or the bureaucracy. the nibbling finally came to an end when two of these important measures came into the hands of the senior senator from connecticut . he used that kledge gained over many years of public service. and that ability which he has demonstrated over the years. to insist that these measures longer be nibbled to death or fade away into the mist. but. rather. become the law of the land. were it  for the harded position which he has taken over the past several months. i k that these measures would  be before us for consideration by the senate.
i basically agree with the senator from alabama. indeed. my own feelings have always been in the past. and i have said so. that there should be a net worth statement and a tax return feature. even though i believe that it invades our privacy. i believe there is a greater obligation on the part of each one of us to make our ecoic interests kn so that people can weigh that against the votes we cast in the chamber. so i do  disagree with the senator at all. the problem is i think we are trying to get a start on disclosure around here. we really do  have adequate provisions. i do  think we have any way. of public disclosure as to the ecoic interests of the cabinet members. senators. and congressmen. what i am saying is that. if i had my druthers. i would like to have a specific section in here where everybody declares what they have got. the amounts. exactly what they are. i do  deny that. on the other hand. i respect some of my colleagues who feel it is an invasion of privacy. that maybe in some ecoic sense it might subject them and their families to undue dangers where the amount of money they have is kn. and so forth. all right. i think that is their feeling. i do  feel that way. but there we are. i am just wondering really what is served. in other words. by putting in more categories. i would almost rather see the senator from alabama go ahead and put in a specific section. in other words. i think my colleague from connecticut has proposed something which is as good as you can get if you are going to try the category approach. and i am all for the category approach as a start for the purpose of getting some financial disclosure. but if we are going to change. if there is going to be an amendment. it seems to me the real issue is joined as to whether it ought to be in the general sense as to what we have before us or the more specific detailing of the members finances. i wanted to make that comment. i am here to listen. although i am on the committee and i worked very diligently. along with the other members. and i think all of us are in a very experimental area. and i want to point that out to the senior senator from connecticut. who is making a first step here toward financial disclosure. i do  want it imputed to him that he does  want anything other than the most stringent standards to apply to all of us. i think he does. but what we are trying to do is to get a bill passed and make a start in trying to cover what has heretofore been unexplored ground.
. the american system of internal revenue is uniquely successful. its success flies in the face of the experience of most nations in the world. and throughout the history of the world. we do  need rampaging tax collectors. we have cooperative citizens. virtually one finds the obligation of paying taxes pleasant. yet although april 15 is generally regarded as a national day of reckoning. private income taxes are collected with relative ease. i attribute this to one central fact: trust. taxpayers disclose their private financial circumstances. things that they would  mention to inlaws or friends. to their government because they understand the need for taxes. and trust their government to keep their private lives private. each taxpayer should be confident that the filing of his or her tax returns in way compromises the right of privacy. with the adoption of these provisions. we will be able to give the american people that assurance. the tax privacy provisions will guarantee to americans by law the privacy that should never have been eroded by practice. the rights of individuals to be free from political manipulation by tax blackmail soon will be law. future henchmen of corruption will lose one more weapon. all of us gain one more shield.
. early this morning i heard the news of the tragic death of representative jerry litton. who was killed last evening in an airplane accident. as he left to celebrate the greatest political victory of his impressive career. my association with representative litton began more than 2 years ago. when we joined forces in an effort to pass legislation to protect the confidentiality of tax returns. through his untiring efforts. more than half of the membership of the house of representatives cosponsored our legislation. during this time. i was emously impressed with his perseverance on behalf of the principles and ideals upon which our nation was founded and prospers. i am deeply saddened by the passing of this dedicated public servant. i extend my heartfelt sympathy to the relatives and friends he leaves behind.
. i move to recommit h.r. 10612. the tax reform act of 1976. with instructions that the committee report back forthwith with an amendment in the nature ofa substitute which contains only the provisions extending individual income tax reductions and the $35 credit through calendar year 1977.
in response to the senator from colorado. this legislation. as it  sits before us. flies right in the face of the budgetary process which we created. it flies right in the face of the credibility which we are trying to establish between this body and the people of the united states. it flies right in the face of what is commonly conceived as tax reform. indeed. e of us are doing right either by ourselves or by the process. 
. i rise in opposition. it was entirely consistent with what was said last night. the argument was. "dont worry. you fellows do everything you want to outright. we will take it to conference and it will come out all right." that may have been the old way of doing things but it is  the new way of doing things. this will  salve my conscience and i do  think it will salve the conscience of anybody in the chamber. the fact that it is going to conference with a resolution that makes it look all right is  all right with this senator. we formed a budget committee and we have the responsibility to go ahead and produce a fiscally sound bill. we have done neither. after the disgraceful exhibition of some 100 amendments. or whatever it is. this sense of the senate resolution does  make things all right. we have blasted our budget concept. we have absolutely destroyed the fiscal integrity of this country. and our political credibility is down the hole. resolution is going to fix it. i have said it all. as far as i am concerned i am against the resolution and i will certainly vote against the bill.
it is with unbounded enthusiasm that i cast my vote against the tax reform act of 1976. as considered. it has destroyed the political credibility of the u.s. senate. as passed. it would devastate the fiscal integrity of the united states. the next step is to say that our political and fiscal panderings will  survive conference. therefore. harm can come from reporting out the bill. i will  be part of such a charade. regardless of each senators degree of participation in this fiscal fiascoand all. this senator included. have participatedthe time has come to draw the line and state clearly what has been done. this is  tax reform. it is monetary mesmerizing that sticks it to the average american. who is the average american. if you did  have a lobbyist in washington during the past several weeks. check your wallet. second. the low- and middleincome taxpayers who have received the sympathy of every politician get hing. what is given by individual section is taken away by the cumulative total of special interest giveaways. last. if the nation is to grow. money  mirrors is what is needed. instead of having the guts to ask for ecoic sharing and sacrifice. the senate has ecoically gutted america.
. the socioecoic makeup of this nation is constantl3 3 changing. we need to k whether th current formulas reflect these changes  twenty years agoeven 10 years ago3 there were valid reasons for distributing federal money to what were then ecoically disadvantaged states of our nation because we are as strong as our separate regions. there were and still are valid and necessary reasons for maintaining a federal focus on regions of the country like appalachia. . however. today. we must reexamine these programs to determine whether. in - fact. those programs which were instituted to help the ecoically disadvantaged states axe working to the detriment of states like my own state of connecticut. and whether federal assistance is flowing to states which longer need this help. frankly. i look at recent statistics developed by both government and private organizations and i do  like what i see. my state of connecticut carries the highest federal tax burden in the nation. on a per capita basis. it has been established that a citizen of connecticut pays $1.800 per year in federal taxes. that is $400 more per capita than the national average of $1.400. worse yet. for every dollar connecticut pays in federal taxes. it receives back 92 cents from the federal government. while some states receive as much as $2.60 back for every tax dollar sent to washington. connecticut is  alone in this regard. for it enjoys the unhappy company of states like new york. delaware. minnesota. illis. massachusetts. ohio. michigan. and oregonto name a few. for the last 15 years. connecticut. along with others.  labeled "mature industrial states." has suffered deteriorating cities high unemployment. high energy costs. and loss of skilled young workers. these factors have had a spiraling effect on state and local government. they have eroded the tax base so severely as to force a choice between raising taxes to impossible levels or cutting services so drastically as to diminish the quality of life. the "catch 22" in this is that whichever route is taken. the cost of living and the real costs of state and local government will continue to rise at a rate higher than the national average. for instance. according to the most recent data available. what $1 will buy nationally. costs $1.03 in connecticut. 91 cents in georgia. recent studies have reinforced the bejief that the problems of connecticut and those other states which make up our mature industrial states are  cyclicalbut. are structural in nature. connecticut was suffering an 8.9percent unemployment rate as early as 1971. 2 years before the current national recession began. today. as unemployment nationally has dropped to 7.9 percentunemployment in connecticut hovers around 10 percenta rate which is unacceptable for any state to suffer. yet. as i look at the recent studies on - federal funds transfers. the federal moneys are  flowing to states like connecticut which need it most. but r rather from connecticut to states which. in comparison. are experiencing relatively lowunemployment. highcapital growth rates and general increases in the quality of life. the studies are numerous. but e is complete. therefore. we can hold up this important legislation in anticipation of finding the right formula adjustment overnight. that will  happen. instead. we need a governmental organization. like the commission to examine these formulas from the stand* point of need. to determine if current formulas accurately reflect the needs of our state and local governments and equitably distribute federal funds among the several states. we need the commission to put the mass of reference material together in a single document for us to study and work from in the future. if we do find that the allocation formulas discriminate against individual regions of this country. then we must work together to equalize the burden. the continuance of this trend would create a permanent. structural. ecoic imbalance which spells fiscal crisis for my state of connecticut and others for years to come. stretching from minnesota. and illis. all the way east to connecticut. new york. new jersey. and delaware. we will have a new appalachia on our hands. i have discussed the amendment with the joint committee staff and senator hathaway and it seems to be acceptable to him.
ial campaigns. frankly. i have been disappointed with myself ever since. remember how that was sold on the basis of being watergate reform. that is the way it was sold. it is true that it was passed during the era of watergate. but have any senators read the watergate committees report on that subject. let me quote from the report. to see just how far afield this body can go in an exercise of demagoguery. recommendation  7. found on page 572 of that report: 7. the committee recommends against the adoption of any form of public financing in which tax moneys are collected and allocated to political candidates by the federal government. the select committee opposes the various proposals which have been offered in the congress to provide mandatory public financing of campaigns for federal office. while recognizing the basis of support for the concept of public financing and the potential difficulty in adequately funding campaigns in the midst of strict limitations on the form and amount of contributions. the committee takes issue with the contention that public financing affords either an effective or appropriate solution. thomas jefferson believed "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors. is sinful and tyrannical." the committees opposition is based like jeffersons upon the fundamental need to protect the voluntary right of individual citizens to express themselves politically as guaranteed by the first amendment. furthermore. we find inherent dangers in authorizing the federal bureaucracy to fund and excessively regulate political campaigns. the abuses experienced during the 1972 campaign and unearthed by the select committee were perpetrated in the absence of any effective regulation of the source. form. or amount of campaign contributions. in fact. despite the progress made by the federal elections campaign act of 1971. in requiring full public disclosure of contributions. the 1972 campaign still was funded through a system of essentially unrestricted. private financing. what  seems appropriate is  the abandonment of private financing. but rather the reform of that system in an effort to vastly expand the voluntary participation of individual citizens while avoiding the abuses of earlier campaigns. yet. that is termed watergate reform. even though. in black and white. the committee which was charged with the responsibility of unearthing those abuses and then making whatever recommendations it deemed appropriate clearly recommended against federal financing. so. what followed was  watergate reform but. rather. certain activists. certain reformers. certain senators. and certain philosophers using an atmosphere of tragedy and apprehension to attain a legislative end that. standing alone. in more deliberative times. would  have gotten a hearing. much less a final passage vote. you can call that federal financing of political campaigns. but never again call it watergate reform. what earthly logic. in the light of the facts of watergate. could defend giving the federal government more power over the people it is supposed to serve. indeed. the practical result of this "watergate reform" was to take away one of the checks the people have on their governmentspecifically. their resourcesand nationalize it. let me be very specific. i have problems with the dollar limits on contributions or full disclosure and reporting or eliminating multiple committees. those truly were reforms of problems discovered by the watergate committee. but i saw hing in the fact of watergate that indicated that the people of this nation deserve the punishment of a federal election financing act. indeed. to put the "reform" achieved in its proper light. the only candidates in the last election to receive federal funds were the democrats and the republicansand that at a time when fewer people were enrolling as democrats or republicans and more were staying independent. as a proclamation of freedom from and/or their disgust with the political establishment. reform. for whom. it was more like a transfusion of the taxpayers money into a politics that could  hack it on its own. i cite the federal financing experience as an example of reform that was . it was the first step in nationalizing and neutralizing the individual response factor in american politics. the second step in that nationalization is before us today. whereas federal financing set the criteria of eligibility for political contributions. at the common level of being a warm body. this ethics code places the criteria of who should be a senator in the hands of the senate. people used to worry about nixon perpetuating himself. if we keep legislating as we have in the past year. the american people will have deeded their resources. their judgment. and. yes. eventually their vote. to those whose incompetence. whose insensitivity. and whose intransigence created the need for reform in the first place. what makes this whole exercise on the floor so redundant is that a system to achieve appropriate senatorial ethics already is in place. it is kn as the democratic process. the election process.
that is right. there is an expense involved. but i think the expense. very frankly. in money is far better than paying it off in the coinage of the constitution. yes. there is an expense involved in dollars to every senator to do this every year. question about it. in order to be accurate.
the senator picked the easiest example. and on this point i really do  have to frighten my colleagues overly much because the chances are most every community in which we live does that job for us once a year. probably. in the instance. of a house that would be done by the tax assessor of the town.
i am  getting off the hook with the senator because i am saying the senator probably could refer to some other example where it would require an appraisal every year. i am  in any manner. shape. or form implying such activity would  have to take place. your house example i do  think is the best example. as i said. usually that is done by a town or a municipality once every year anyway at expense to the taxpayers except for the tax bill they have to pay.
let me. if i may. respond to the correct statements of facts by both the senator from connecticut and the senator from wisconsin. there is question of the fact that this issue troubled me a great deal. the senator is correct. i think. along with him. i have been one of the leaders in the fight for tax privacy. in fact. the tax privacy provisions of the tax reform act of 1976 were a result of work by representative litton of missouri. and myself. that was a result of 3 years of work. and finally. as a result of a compromise. a portion of our work went into that act. yes. i strongly believe in total tax privacy. that was one of the reforms that came out of watergate. to be sure that the internal revenue service did  become a lending library to every institution of government. ordinarly. i would  demand something of ourselves as senators that i would  demand of the american people. but i believe extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. i would be willing to pay the price. myself. in terms of loss of privacy. as far as i am concerned. and i believe other senators would. rather than pay it in terms of damage to the constitution of the united states. which belongs to everyone. i recognize full well this is totally opposite to what i have fought for and stood for as far as tax privacy for everyone is concerned. but frankly. if that is what is required to overcome a monstrous piece of demagoguery which does constitutional damage. i believe i should be willing to pay the price. and i believe everyone here should be. it is difficult for me to be debating this issue with my colleague from connecticut. who has probably been the strongest advocate of the positions i have held. if it were  for the power of seniority which he holds. all the watergate issues would have died two years ago. ody would have been interested. in terms of reform. this legislation does  do the job. but it is true that i am being inconsistent on the matter of tax privacy.
. i merely emphasize those comments made both by the distinguished senator from idaho and those of the distinguished senator from florida as to the fact that this system does  belong to congress or the internal revenue service. it belongs to the people of this country. certainly. we gather around us all the possible professional expertise to draft a law. the irs has all the professional expertise to enforce the law. it seems to me that the people of this country also deserve some expertise. i support the amendment.
. i once again want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the chairman of our subcommittee. the hoable ernest f. hollings. it has been a great pleasure for me to serve on this subcommittee again. i would like to thank for his patience and his wisdom in what used to be maybe a rather routine appropriations task but which has become exceedingly complex. i particularly commend him for avoiding something that has become more and more prevalent within this body. and that is a regional approach toward national problems. the senator from south carolina made it a point in item after item to bring a national viewpoint to whatever it was that was being requested. and  one of selfinterest or parochialism or regionalism. and for that i thank him and. indeed. all my colleagues should. and that is the reason why this is a national appropriations budget for all these agencies and  that of any particular individual.
i rise to support the amendment of the distinguished senator from illis and state that is a minimal step in the direction of conservation that could be taken during the course of this bill. it is an awful bill from the point of view of conservation. it does very little. it asks for sacrifice whatsoever from either the american people. congress. industry. or labor. it asks for hing. it is going to conserve hing. i think in the sense of setting an example of sacrifice. senator percys amendment would be an excellent step. i do  k whether the senator from illis has pointed out the fact that if you charged for these spaces. a good number of the spaces would be relinquished and you would  have to build additional parking. something which is currently being considered at great cost. so i think that from the point of view of saving money and more particularly from the point of view of setting an example for the american people to show them that we are serious about conservation. something which is going to require selfdiscipline and sacrifice from the american people. this is a small move that fits well within the concepts of this bill. i completely support it and commend the distinguished senator from illis for his amendment. like everything else. i might add. i think he should be prepared to get bombed out of the water when the vote gets taken. the other day in the committee i suggested some minimal form of mandatory rationing. and got beaten 13 tol. we like to talk about all these things. we like to talk about saving fuel. we like to talk about additional production. and what do we do. we allow volunteerism on the users side and controls on the production side. and we wonder why we have hing. we are using more and producing less and this whole exercise has become a charade. this is the basic difficulty. i have additional comments to make when i put in my rationing proposal. for which i do  imagine i will get many votes. the american people who expect leadership from us wonder why in 4 years prices continue to rise and supplies continue to decline. for 4 years there has been hing but volunteerism. so. there is a very simple reason why we sit where we do. our inaction has directly resulted in. what is it this year. a $25 billion to $30 billion deficit in the balance of payments. most of which is attributable to the importation of oil. how many years do you think the united states of america can stand that kind of imbalance. and if "balance of payments deficit." is an academic term. let me tell you exactly what it means. it means that that money is  in the united states for jobs in the united states. it means that money is  in your pocket to spend in the united states. it is as simple as that. i commend the senator from illis.
. i ask unanimous consent that table i outlining alternative property tax claim settlement options. table ii. listing estimated property tax claims by state. and the text of the bill be printed at this point in the record.
. i should like to comment on several remarks made by the distinguished senator from mississippi. because i think they deserve a response. the senator from mississippi complimented various and sundry cities of this nation for trying to help themselves get out of a financial bind.  1. there is  a city in the united states that is  in a bind. due to a variety of factorsperhaps in some instances mismanagement on their part or playing too much politics at the taxpayers expense. however. i think we would all agree that the federal commitment. both in terms of congress and the white house. over the past several years. has been somewhat of a declining commitment. and that is the reason why cities find themselves in their present day difficulties. but at least those cities have the option to devise various means by which to get out from underneath their troubles.  1. it is all right for us to say that the federal government has been generous to the district of columbia. indeed. the federal government has been generous to the state of mississippi. but the state of mississippithe gover and the legislatureruns its own affairs. the state of mississippis affairs have a vote in the senate and in the house. the federal government would  have the gall to impose on the state of mississippi what the federal government has imposed on the city of washington for decades. but here comes the city of washington. under its newly granted home rule. which was granted by us. and says. "all right. we longer want a federal handout to help us with our urban problems. we have an idea which. if you will allow us to try it. will generate private money. private capital. to come in and do an urban renewal job and create jobs." they sooner come up with their idea. just as other cities have their ideas. as referred to as the distinguished senator from mississippi. and we say. " you cant do it that way." if. indeed. they have the highest tax burden. and so on down the checklist of tax liabilities. as set forth by the distinguished senator from mississippi. who has created that problem. the senator from mississippi. being in the business of defense. ks as well as i do that there is an element of leadtime in any of these expenditures. the district of columbia has  been the ruler of its own house. it has been the congress of the united states that has run the district of columbia. this highest tax burden and highest tax liability situation did  occur yesterday. it is one that has been created over a period of time. the senator is correct when he says that washington. d.c.. along with the rest of our cities. has some real problems and that it is going to take initative and ination on their part to get out from under these problems. but i think that is exactly what the district is proposing when it comes to congress and says. "we want a loan in order to establish this civic center. which civic center should.  1. rehabilitate the district. the downtown area. at private expense. which civic center should employ thousands of persons.  only in the construction of the center but also in the running of the center and the various businesses that will be built around the center." as elected representatives.  one of us in this chamber would tolerate the major city of our state to be in the condition in which washington. d.c. is. we have spared expense. as senator eagleton and i wrote in our letter. as to the esthetics and the job opportunities of the federal establishment in this area. if you want to take two similar names and compare them. take a look at mt. ver square in the district of columbia. and then take a look at mt. ver. aside from our life here on the hill and the occasional jaunts of our families in midday to the downtown district. aside from constitution avenue and a fw of the main thoroughfares. who spends much time in the district of columbia. who is it who after 5 oclock cares to spend much time in the district of columbia.  i think what is being proposed here is the first initiative by the government of the district to. in effect. make washington a livable city in a total sense.  livable just for federal employees.  livable from 8 to 5. but a place of commerce. a place of living. one which is open the same hours we are open here on the hill. having stated that initiative. i think it is for us to go ahead and back up the elected representatives of the district. let me just say. in conclusion. before i sit down that we had a similar problem in the city of hartford. conn. our downtown area had deteriorated to the point where it was an 8to5 city and going downhill. the civic center was built at a cost of some $60 million. and within 1 year turned a profit. but. more importantly. it has rehabilitated the entire downtown area of hartford. conn..  with moneys of the taxpayers of the state of connecticut or of the federal government but private capital. criticism was made that the center is expensive. it is  compared to the cost of other centers. the new one being built in san francisco at the present time comes almost to the same amount. i realize it is tough for all of us to cut the umbilical cord here and have faith and trust in the elected representatives of the district. but i think we all would be more than a little miffed if such faith and trust were  reposed in us in decisions we make when it comes to our own constituencies. regardless of whether or  we are used to telling them how to conduct their affairs. i think the time has come in our actions to live up to what it is we granted them several years back when we granted home rule. i think the project makes sense. it is  without its risks. just as senator goldwater stated. and senator eagleton and i k. but i k what the certainty is because the certainty has been conducted over a period of years. it is more federal money.  loans. but grants. direct outlays. more and more of that as compared to the possibility of a loan being used as seed money to attract private capital. i find that a very big difference and a very enticing one indeed. and one which far from stifling we should encourage more of so far as congress is concerned.
. i suppose i have to ask a question as to whether or  we are going to be allowed to vote on the amendment of the distinguished senator from south carolina. i think that is really the issue here. it is  a matter of discussion. it is quite frankly a parliamentary device we are being placed through so we can go around the formal procedure of the senate. i am  one of those who ever believed. and hopefully never will. that the end justifies the means. i think we are talking about the appropriations process. the budget process. i think these things should be observed. i wish the distinguished senator from louisiana were on the floor  because i would like to k whether or  we are going to vote on the hollings amendment . if he wants it delayed. i think that should be kn also. if that is the case. i will be glad to go ahead and hold the floor because i k that i can hold the floor as long as anybody else can. i sympathize with the problems that confront the finance committee. but the reason we are here debating this particular issue is because of the inability of the finance committee to do its job. had it done its job. there would have been plenty of time to go through the requirements of the process and those requirements certainly include the appropriations committee and the budget committee. i am  willing to trust an energy policy to any one or several individuals. in essence this body. without instructions. i grant. we had a test on that matter several times before. but  we are going even further. we are going to the point of obviating the mal processes of this body. i advise my colleagues that this is something. sooner or later. that will catch up with each one of them. i ice the distinguished senator from louisiana is in the rear of the chamber. i wonder if he might respond to my question as to whether or  we could have a vote on the amendment of the senator from south carolina immediately. my question to the distinguished senator from louisiana is whether or  we could possibly have a vote on the substance before us. his motion to table having failed. as to whether or  this matter   be voted up or down. really what we are voting up or down is  the substance or the merits. which have been described very eloquently here by both sides. but merely the matter of procedure. i am  willing to go ahead and follow a procedure by anyone in this body. i point this out as to whether or  it is violating the appropriations process or the budget process. i realize that having been on the short end of the vote. there may be unwillingness to have a vote immediately on the amendment before us. the amendment of the distinguished senator from south carolina. is this something we can have right . or .
what is of concern to me. and i think to many on this floor is the urgency of the problem that confronts the u.s. senate in the sense of an energy crisis. certainly. the distinguished senator from louisiana has made very substantial contributions to going ahead and resolving that crisis. on the other hand. i have to stop somewhat short of entrusting the fate of the resolution of this crisis to his hands and his hands alone. he and i have had this pointed out. i believe in the tax reform act of 1976. where i was told that everything would work out if the senator from louisiana could go to conference. i disputed then and  many of his philosophies. and the principles i would agree with on this issue. but i will  agree to either he or the president of the united states having the power to resolve something which each one of us wants to address ourselves to and to go ahead and advocate to this same body that we -hould circumvent the appropriations process or the budget process. i do  care what the merits are. first of all. we have to get to first base. on its merits. i voted for much of what the senator from louisiana believes in. deregulation. decontrol. i do  believe i am very much opposed to the senator from south carolina philosophically. but i am  willing. matter what the merits are. to go ahead and tread over the bounds of these processes which guarantee a thorough examination of any problem. that examination has to be made both from the sense of substance and merit. and that is the purpose of the authorization in the terms of appropriation and the terms of budget. all these elements. i am  willing to go ahead and lump them into one committee. that is what is involved here. i think the arguments presented by the distinguished senator from oregon and the distinguished senator from arkansas are. indeed. very enlightened. but they do  get to the point which  confronts us. are we. under the weight of the emergency and the crisis. willing to throw procedure overboard. that i am  willing to go ahead and do. i think in essence the reason why the distinguished senator from louisiana lost on the last count was  because of his philosophy.  because of the merits. but because this encroachment of law and of custom. when it takes place. takes place under the guise of emergency and of the seriousness of any particular problem. this is what is at issue . that is why i say. why  get on to the business of voting on the motion of the distinguished senator from south carolina because. indeed. it really has  that much to do with substance or merit. it has to do with the procedures of the u.s. senate. i think we can get it over with very fast. let us keep going on amendments and on substance. as i have indicated.
. i would like to briefly reemphasize some of the remarks i made several months ago when the issue of the d.c. convention center was before us. the citys proposed convention center represents a major initiative by the government of the district to make washington a livable city in a total sense. it will generate private capital to stimulate urban renewal. it will create thousands of jobs. and it will rekindle the lights in sections of this city that have been dead for decades. as responsible legislators. i think it is our job to go ahead and support the elected representatives of the district in this venture. i was one of the principal supporters of the convention center and am  pleased that a compromise has been reached. approval of the pending fiscal year 1978 appropriation request for $27 million for the center is contingent upon conditions which insure a firm commitment of the private sector. the money for this project has been put into the bill but can be obligated until a new plan is approved by the mayor. the city council. and both house and senate appropriation subcommittees overall. i think this is a reasonable and fair compromise which places the convention center one step closer to completion. i commend the chairman for his initiative in moving this problem off dead center toward a solution and i recommend approval of the conference report
. the shock and sadness of senator james b. allens passing last week is eased only by the great respect and appreciation we have for his years of service among us here in the senate. the senator from alabama and i disagreed on many issues which came before the senate. and yet at all times his resourcefulness and imagination made him a formidable opponent. courtesy. fairness. and respect were his unfailing trademarks. perhaps the greatest debt of gratitude owed to jim allen by the senate and the nation is for his tireless defense of miity interests in congress. his inative and skillful use of the senate rules and procedures on many occasions preserved the precious right in our democracy of miity voices to be heard and to have their influence felt at the highest levels of government. in times which cry for the reestablishment of political and ideological balance in america. jim allen stood as an immovable object in the path of some seemingly inexorable majorities. for that we respect him. ho him. and will deeply miss him.*
the senator ks as well as i do that if these people suddenly call in their chips. we are all going to be scurrying around in a hell of an ecoic condition. there is question in my mind that the decision that was made on the senate floor about a month ago was very clearly affected by.  1. our dependence on arab oil. and.  2. the fear of what would happen if they withdrew their investment in this country. that is a bad situation for a country that prides itself on its independence and its ability merely to go ahead and act on what the facts are. i realize quite frankly. as the chairman ks. that i lean toward what is sometimes termed a republican point of view in the sense of.  we are  in a profitmaking business. yes. we are obviously going to run some sort of deficits. i think the deficits we are presently running are extraordinary. far too great. i think $55 billion going for interest is far too great. the point i was trying to make here is the portion of our debt that is owned by foreign interests. i think it is far too high and it very clearly dramatizes the hole which we have dug for ourselves.
i thank the senator. . i rise to oppose the amendment. i do so as one who. for 10 years. has opposed any amendment. any suggestion. any legislation that would bring about a firearm registration scheme. likewise. i have opposed any suggestions as to the total ban of handguns. indeed. in a philosophical sense. relative to the issue of gun control. i would say the senator from idaho and myself would have been. and probably are. 100 percent up to this point. on the same side. on the other hand. what is being done here is an exercise in demagoguery. or an exercise in bending to lobby pressure that i do  think gives much distinction to those who engage in it. it is what i would probably refer to as the "bad thoughts" amendmentin other words. that someone in the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms has presented ideas that are opposed here on this floor. and when those ideas were withdrawn. it is still felt necessary to punish the individual or the agency that put forward the idea in the first place. clearly. there was an initial attempt to bring about regulation devising a scheme of comprehensive registration over at the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. just as clearly. that attempt ended on the rocks. both in the sense of the withdrawal of that scheme by the bureau and of the efforts of the chairman of the subcommittee in getting specific responses from the bureau which stated that the legislation. or. rather. the rulemaking would  continue. and that indeed. if it were to continue and be implemented. the bureau would come back to congress for approval. the language is very. very explicit in the report on the desk of each one of the members. it gives the history of what was proposed. then goes on to state: the house reduced the budget estimate by $4.2 million which was estimated to be the initial cost of implementing the proposed regulations. the deputy secretary of the treasury has informed the committee that funds are contained in the fiscal year 1979 budget for the purpose of implementing the proposed regulations and " * * we will  implement these proposals without receiving from congress the funds to do so." on this basis. the committee recommends restoration of the $4.2 million house reduction but continues the restrictive language that prohibits use of any funds to implement the proposed regulations. i do  k how you get more specific than that. i do  think it is up to us to go ahead and punish thosewherever they are. be they in the bureaucracy or the citizenry or anyplace elsewhose ideas differ from ours. i oppose these ideas of the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms. but i will admit they fairly represent a sentiment in this country for some sort of registration system. it is a perfectly valid sentiment. it is one i oppose. but it is valid. and even if it were invalid. you do  go around punishing people for their ideas. that is all this amendment is. a punishment. it is a punishment for ideas which the senator from idaho and a good many others oppose. it will certainly make everybody in the "gun lobby" feel great because we are on their side. but a few more inane exercises with basis such as this and. believe me. those of us who have been against the registration system are going to find ourselves on the short end of a vote. up to this point. i think that logic has been in our favor. as i have stated many times. what good does it do me. if i am lying dead on the floor. having been shot with a registered gun. good at all. that is  the problem. the problem is keeping that gun out of the wrong hands in the first instance. do i think. then. the solution is a ban on all handguns. certainly . we go right against all the existing constitutional principles in gearing our legislation. if you will. to the exceptions. but. after the battle has been won and won by the efforts of the distinguished chairman of the committee and members of the house. we do  go out and punish somebody for bad ideas. the money is  coming out of the scheme that was proposed. it is coming out of other activities. we can change peoples ideas. i am sure they will have aher run at us in this area. it is up to us to be on our toes. if you will. and block them. i realize the appeal of the amendment to the senator from idaho. but it accomplishes hing. most of your k that it was only a few weeks ago that i wasstill amin conflict with the federal trade commission on the issue of their rulemaking visavis childrens advertising. i made the statement that i thought they were on very dangerous first amendment grounds. if i could have gotten a retraction from the ftc such as that we have obtained from the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. believe me. i would have won the battle and that would have been the end of it. the reason i have to use the appropriations process is that they have written such statement saying that "we are going to discontinue the investigation" or "we will  move forward until we have consulted congress." they have  written that. the bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms has. it would be like the ftc saying. "all right. senator. we agree on a dangerous constitutional ground." and then  pursuing this. and then my saying. "we will still cut your budget." it is punishment for bad thoughts. i realize the bureaucracy is  easy to handle. but the appropriations process is where we can confront them every year. indeed. if they do  go ahead and respond to the admonitions. they will be around next year. and they might find themselves with money at all if they try to go ahead and renege on the promises and representations they made to congress. so there is argument. i am almost fairly certain i speak for the distinguished senator from florida that ideologically on this particular issue we are in the same camp. that this is  the way to go ahead and achieve an end which has already been achieved. rather. i think it makes us. those who have been in the same camp. look pretty bad in the sense that we are going to go ahead and use the budgetary process to tell people downtown we will  let them think. and if we disagree. we will let them have it financially. they ought to be here to see if the senator from idaho and the senator from connecticut have their way on the issues. that is a good thing. i would hope this amendment would be defeated. and for the reasons i have stated. i do  k how anything can be more explicit as to bringing an end to the scheme than that existing in the report language. in the bill. and as a result of the letter from secretary of the treasury. what i do  need on my legislative record is aher lobbyist victory for the nra. i have done very well on their behalf without them for 10 years. all this does is either reelect some senators and make them feel they are earning their money. for all those reasons. the amendment is horrible
the answer in response to the distinguished senator from massachusetts is  i did  change it. and i will tell him why i did  change it. i am  asking for a report on general urban conditions or a general report on urban conditions. i am asking for a report on the fiscal condition of cities around this country. conditions that are similar to those that precipitated the new york situation in a fiscal sense. it is in that narrow sense that i am looking for a report. i must confess i find it amazing that with the modification of my amendment the way it  is which is merely to get back a report of fiscal condition of cities around this country. that it will be denied by my colleagues. because of the obvious fact that amendments whatsoever are to be attached to this legislation. in the sense of getting the facts at hand on which we legislate in the future. i find it difficult to reason as to why there is opposition to the amendment as  written.
the fact is comac had assets. it was debt financed entirely. that was the reason why the landlord would  engage in a lease as between himself and comac. my question would then have to go to the next point. as chief executive officer under those conditions does the senator  feel that either a guarantee or some sort of a written document would be in the best interest of creatives stockholders.
. i am pleased to join senator hathaway in introducing this legislation to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to provide for a credit for investment in new issues of stock of small- and mediumsized corporations. by encouraging the participation of individual investors in the capital markets. this bill will help to solve the critical problem of providing equity capital for americas small businesses. it is imperative that the private sector provide for the nations future employment needs. smaller. growthoriented businesses hold the key to solving these needs. as shown by the results of a study conducted in 1976 by the development fund of mit. the job formation rates of 16 companies were compared from 1969 to 1974. six of the companies were giants. with sales in the billions. five were smaller companies built on new techogies. even though their total sales were less than onefortieth of those in the largest group. the five small companies created 35.000 new jobs in 5 years. while the six giants only created a total of 25.000 jobs. thus. despite the gross size disparity. the smaller firms created 10.000 more jobs than the established giants. further evidence of the emous potential for job creation was adduced by the american electronics association ("aea") at a hearing held by the select committee on small business. a study of aea members disclosed that the employment growth rates for young companiesless than 20 years oldwere 20 to 115 times greater than for the companies more than 20 years old. according to the commerce department. the nation will require 1.5 million new jobs annually until 1985. as evidenced by the mit and aea studies. smaller businesses. with their capacity to produce new jobs. will play a key role in satisfying this need. yet. these companies are unable to obtain the equity financing they need to enable them to grow and provide jobs.
as the chairman and the ranking member of the environment and public works committee ks. the public works and ecoic development act of 1965 (pweda) must be reauthorized by 1980. i believe it is vital that section 204 retain its visibility as a distinct and important program within pweda. this can be accomplished by removing the obstacles that prohibit section 204 from being an operable program before pweda is reauthorized. if the section 204 program is  changed this year. i am extremely concerned that during the pweda reauthorization process. section 204 will be dropped as a separate program and merely become an eligible activity under the title ix program. should this happen. i believe congressional intent and oversight will be lost. in addition. there would be guarantee that adequate funding would be provided to establish successful local revolving loan funds or that local revolving loan funds would be funded at all. furthermore. the section 204 program. as amended. would offer in 1979 a viable ecoic tool to local units of government for leveraging private business investments to create and retain permanent jobs and stabilize local tax revenue bases. i believe it is safe yet unfortunate to say that many of the urban legislative initiatives pending before the congress today will  be acted upon this year. my purpose in introducing this amendment. however. is in way intended to circumvent or replace those urban ecoic initiatives. my measure is. instead. an effort to insure a high priority for rural and urban ecoic development during the next 18 months while congress addresses those initiatives. i have spoken with the distinguished chairman of the house subcommittee of ecoic development about my amendment and he plans to take similar steps during house public works full committee markup of ecoic development administration legislation. again. i urge the committee and my colleagues to accept this concept. it has been acted on once before by congress and accepted. again. i can only urge the committee to stick to the original legislative initiative and a vehicle and a mechanism which is in being.  to what has been proposed in the way of assistance by the administration. for those who are hoping that the urban bank will solve all our cities problems. may i point out that it is difficult egh for anyone to get a loan from one of the federal agencies. never mind an agency administered by three of them. section 204 is that vehicle already in being. of course. the concept of ecoic recovery through private enterprise gains credibility as each day goes along.  governmental jobs but real jobs and real growth accomplished by the proper utilization through the section 204 grant program.
. i rise to oppose the amendment of the senator from delaware. i think it is important. in light of the work that the committee has done over the past 6 to 8 months. that we review in detail the report of the subcommittee. so i shall start to read from the report on the 1979 appropriations bill of the appropriations subcommittee on state. justice. commerce. the judiciary. and related agencies. the committee on appropriations. to which was referred the bill. making appropriations for the departments of state. justice. and commerce. the judiciary. and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30. 1979. and for other purposes. reports the same to the senate with various amendments and presents herewith information relative to the changes made.
: the committee recommends an appropriation of $8.000.000. the same as the 1978 appropriations to date. the amount recommended is $600.000 under the budget estimate and $8.000.000 over the amount allowed by the house. the committee is very much concerned about the proliferation of international conferences in which the u.s. government participates and the number of delegates who attend these conferences. this concern is particularly well founded in view of secretary vances memorandum of april 18. 1977 on policies governing u.s. delegations to international conferences and meetings which seek to reduce the size of these delegations. accordingly. the committee directs the department to scrutinize carefully the need for u.s. participation in each projected international conference and to examine closely the list of u.s. delegates to all such conferences with a view to controlling and minimizing our participation. the committee is aware that there are carryover funds amounting to approximately $1.600.000 of which $600.000 can be properly used in addition to the recommended appropriation. . if. indeed. the senator from delaware had taken the time to zero in on this type of committees work. it might have been a very productive area of budget cutting. indeed. i raised some of these points in the hearings. but. believe me. there is always the state department. or the administration trying to get the attention of the committee. so the budget is reduced. probably if he had come in here with specific amendments attacking this aspect of the appropriations bill. he would have got a great deal of support. probably even from this senator. if there is an expensive activity. it is all the commissions and conferences we have. it is a very expensive undertaking insofar as our foreign relations are concerned. however. i did  see that kind of homework done at all. rather. the proposed amendment simply cuts everything. the good along with the bad. well. let us get something that comes a little closer to home here. let us talk about the department of justice. i will. be anxious to see what the final result of the substitute amendment is. since the distinguished senator from south carolina already went ahead and agreed with the senator from massachusetts to add 48 more people to the justice department rolls. i do  quite understand. i have just learned this aftern. hing we have done in the last 6 months really had much bearing on anything. just come here. shake a fist. and everybody just fades away. department of justice:
then. i gather that the distinguished chairman. the senator from south carolina. does  want to speak. i read: the committee recommends an appropriation of $46.377.000. an increase of $5.369.000 over the 1978 appropriations to date. the amount recommended is the same as the budget estimate and $46.377.000 over the amount allowed by the house. and will support a total of 977 permanent positions. the increase over the current appropriation will provide for discretionary increases as well as funds requested for program increases. these include 27 additional positions to improve management and administrative capabilities. and 30 additional positions for legislative support. research. and analysis and regulatory activities. . i wonder if i might have order.
i thank the chair. reading: in addition. funds are included for support of cases involving private conspiratorial conduct such as price fixing and for extraordinary litigating expenses associated with the a.t. & t. and ibm cases. this appropriation includes $10.000.000 for grants to states to improve their antitrust enforcement capabilities. the sum of $1.000.000 was appropriated for fiscal year 1977 and $10.000.000 for fiscal year 1978. under this program. grants are made pursuant to state plans. which provide for administration bv the state attorney general and set forth in antitrust training program for state officials. salaries and expenses. u.s. attorneys and marshals 1978 appropriations to date-- $179. 075. 000 1979 budget estimate -...... 196.736.000 house allowance ............ committee recommendation- 196.700. 000 excludes pending supplemental appropriation estimates of $11.495.000. the committee recommends an appropriation of $196.700.000. an increase of $17.625.000 over the 1978 appropriations to date. the amount recommended is $36.000 under the budget estimate and $196.700.000 over the amount allowed by the house. and will support a total of 6.085 permanent positions. the amount recommended includes funds for discretionary increases. primarily related to pay and related benefits. and an increase in the standard level user charges for space. the amount recommended includes funds for 61 additional positions requested for the u.s. attorneys. these . positions. most of which will be paralegals. will enable the u.s. attorneys to handle more civil cases. prosecute more white collar and other criminal cases and improve the quality of appellate work. the funds recommended will also allow a net increase of 83 additional positions for the u.s. marshals service. these additional positions are provided to help alleviate the increased workload in the handling of federal prisoners. provide security protection for judges and magistrates. and assume increased responsibilities in othe supervision of unsentenced prisoners. this chronic shortage of manpower is also reflected in an excessive reliance by the marshals service on parttime professional personnel as replacements when regular deputy marshals are unavailable. these temporary "guards." as they are called. lack the specialized training. expertise. and professionaltsm that a fulltime deputy marshal possesses. it follows that the services performance. to the extent that it is forced to employ minimally qualified individuals. will suffer. here are these manifestations of understaffing more in evidence than in district 8. whlch because of its location on the southwestern border. has become the focus of an intensifying federal law enforcement effort. thus. for example. during a recent month. 37 individuals were employed as temporary guards in district 8. of even greater significance. fully seven of these individuals accumulated 140 or more hours of work during that month. moreover. despite the postponement of some of the less urgent work items in the districts work load. the deputy marshals have accumulated over 5.000 hours of overtime since january 1. 1978. by these indices alone. it is clear that the work load in district 8 is sufficient to require several additional deputies. the committee therefore directs the service to assign fewer thpn 3 of the additional deputy positions authorized in this bill to district 8. the committee is also concerned about the shortage and misallocation of clerical staffing within the u.s. marshals service. again. district 8 provides a clear illustration of the problems. a review of the services clerical staffing pattern has revealed surpluses in some jurisdicitons and shortages in others. the service proposes to correct these imbalances by redistributing positions as attrition in overstaffed jurisdictions permits. generally speaking. this appears to be a reasonable and humane approach. however. it was almost 2 years ago that the 8th district was informed that it would be receiving two additional clerical positions. granted the process of reallocation by attrition is timeconsuming and uncertain. the committee etheless expects that the service will fill the two clerical vacancies in district 8 later than august 30. 1978. the committee is concerned about excessive amounts of overtime performed by employees in the u.s. marshals service and recommends approval of the additional positions requested to offset overtime work. the marshals service should endeavor to reduce such overtime to the absolute minimum necessary in the performance of duty. support of united states prisoners 1978 appropriations to date --- $21.000.000 1979 budget estimate ----------25. 100. 000 house allowance ------------------------committee recommendation_ - 25.100. 000 the committee recommends an appropriation of $25.100.000. an increase of $4.100.000 over the 1978 appropriations to date. the amount recommended is the same as the budget estimate and $25.100.000 over the amount allowed by the house. the 1978 appropriation for the department of justice reflected the transfer of certain responsibilities dealing with u.s. prisoners from the federal prison system to the u.s. marshals service. under this program the marshals service  has fiscal and operational responsibilities for the care. custody. and medical needs of all unsentenced federal prisoners and prisoners awaiting transfer to correctional institutions up to 30 days after sentencing. contracts are made with state and local authorities for the use of approximately 1.200 jail facilities to house such prisoners. fees and expenses o witnesses 1978 appropriations to date --- $20. 050.000 1979 budget estimate ---------- 20. 144.000 house allowance committee recommendation ....- 20.000. 000 the committee recommends an appropriation of $20.000.000. a decrease of $50.c0 under the 1978 appropriations to date. the amount recommended is $144.000 under the budget estimate and $20.000.000 over the amount allowed by the house. this appropriation includes funds for expert and fact witnesses who appear on behalf of the government in all cases to which the united states is a party. the protection of witnesses. and costs for mental competency examinations. salaries and expenses. community relations service 1978 appropriations to date -- $5. 192. 000 1979 budget estimate ----------- 5. 353.000 house allowance ................ committee recommendation ....-- 5.353.000 
madam president. first i would like to express my appreciation to the distinguished senator from south carolina for his handling of the matters relative to the statejusticecommerce appropriations bill. both during the course of the hearings and in conference. i think. in the main. it is a very fine piece of legislation. i think the compromises made during the course of the conference gave full scope to the views contained in the house and the senate versions. however. i would like to use this occasion to express my views on an aspect of the legislation that has been argued on this floor before. and more particularly i would like to do so in relations to the concern that has been shown relative to humphreyhawkins. both outside this chamber and inside. during the past few days. the fact is that on the floor of the senate. when the matter of the appropriation was being debated. we went ahead and cut $75 million from eda under title ii. business loans. eda is an ongoing entity. it is one of the most successful programs to be launched by this government in the sense that it involves the private sector of our ecoy. and more particularly the private sector in the creation of jobs and the assistance of private enterprise and small business in our urban areas in the creation of jobs through private enterprise.  through government. i find it a little perplexing that we cut $75 million out of eda and at the same time we are talking about a new program. humphreyhawkins. and the creation of jobs through government. it makes sense. unless there is some political end to be gained by all the emphasis and all the rhetoric on humphreyhawkins. i do  see where the jobs are enhanced by having to take that piece of legislation and put it through the entire implementation process and the emous amount of time that consumes. when. just a month ago. on this floor. we took an ongoing program and cut it. at random. by $75 million. so let us understand the dichotomy. the contradiction in what it is the senate has been doing. eda has  had the great political buildup that humphreyhawkins has had. but it is an ongoing program. and it is the most effective program within the federal establishment in the creation of jobs. but instead of utilizing it. we cut it back. and while we are doing that. while the senate is doing that. we are out going ahead and pumping for a brand new program the effect of which we k hing aboutgreater bureaucracy and more experimentation with guarantee of results. we wonder why the taxpayers feel we are  handling their money wisely. it is because of an exercise such as that that they are left very perplexed. and i must confess that i am. too. one last comment as to the conference report. and these differences were aired on the floor. i want to say for my part i think a little too vigorously during debates on the appropriations bill. for which i apologize to the distinguished senator from south carolina. it does  take away from my very strong opposition to acrosstheboard cuts relative to the appropriation process. the senator from south carolina and his very able staff. warren kane. and this senator. and tim keeney. of my staff. and others. spent many months in hearings and evaluations on this particular appropriation for state. the department of justice. the commerce department. and the judiciary. we had to make choices. and they were  easy. we had to allocate priorities. throughout the entire appropriations process it was fully in the mind of the distinguished senator from south carolina to come within the budget. if  below it. indeed. he did just that. then at the last minute this bill. along with many others. was caught in this acrosstheboard cut fever. i have already mentioned the cut that took place insofar as eda was concerned. that was the creation of jobs through the private sector. it was  a government program. it was a stimulation of business. and especially business in urban areas. as a result. employment follows. next. i might mention that we cut moneys in the area of narcotics enforcement. we cut funds in the area of antiterrorism activities. we cut funds that were supposed to go to sea grants. which are the government grants to the various universities around this nation to further explore oceans. the point i want to make is this: i feel everybody in this country. or at least it is my observation. feels that when we talk about acrosstheboard cuts. those who advocate that approach conceive that the cuts are going to affect the other fellow. and indeed i will say it right out here . mainly that they are going to affect the disadvantaged in this country. that. indeed. the cuts do  apply to white. middleclass americans. well. i think narcotics enforcement is something that affects all of us. i think antiterrorism or terrorism activities affect all of us. the exploration and development of the oceans applies to all of us. business development in the urban areas applies to all of us. believe me. if we follow this kind of a philosophy much longer. it will go into the defense budget. it will go into medical research. it will go into education. but. most importantly. it will go into every home in america. i find it strange that a nation in which only 50 percent of the people vote is at this time in its history groping around saying: "we do  have any system. we want to get a handle on government. so we have to go the acrosstheboard route. or we have to go the constitutional proposition 13 route." system. what is the free election process. to my way of thinking it is the handle on government if people will choose to grasp it. if the legislators can do the job of spending money wisely. kick them out. but to say there is system admits the failure of freedom in a democracy. the distinguished senator from south carolina and myself were sent down hereup here to him but down here to meto make choices. we are  sent here to push buttons and to act as robots. but to make the tough choices as to what it is that is important. i think overall we have done a fairly good job of that: but i use this occasion to speak out against any sort of a system which would impair that judgment. if we make the right decisions. fine. we can be reelected. if we make the wrong ones. so be it. it is out there for all to see. our whole system of government is one of accountability. you can kick a computer or a robot out of office. you can kick human beings out of office. so. madam president. i urge the adoption of the conference report. even though i have expressed my disappointment as to one aspect of it. i suppose principally i make these remarks today. because there will be aher day. one year hence. and i suggest that if there is dispute with this committee by members within this body that they come before the committee and tell us what it is they want cut. the only time we ever see any senators is when they come in with their pet project which they want added on. if there is a great concern about cutting. i want to see. in the coming year during the appropriation process of the state. justice. commerce. and the judiciary senators coming in and specifically telling us what to cut. i want well publicized what they want cut. one last comment on that: it is very easy to advocate tax cuts. you do  get tax cuts unless you cut spending. ody wants to cut spending. because that is a direct assault on various people. all of whom are voters. so they come to the end of the equation and they say. "cut taxes." for my business types who have been yelling around the united states all these years that there is  anything such as a free lunch. and there is . there is  anything like a tax cut. cut spending. fair egh. but let us  do it at the last minute across the board. let us do it in a wellpublicized way before the committee. speaking for myself. i will . in my area of priorities. give up on the cities or on what needs to be done in drug enforcement. terrorism. or exploration of the oceans. these are priority items. hopefully. they will be addressed as such in the next session of the congress. i urge the adoption of the conference report.
s budget requests. we heard testimony from countless witnesses and marked up the bill line by line. agency by agency. this is the kind of responsibility that we on the appropriations committee are charged with and have carried out diligently under the leadership of the senator from florida. i. for one. think that this kind of approach is the most responsible way to review and control federal spending. and let me say that i agree with those who want to reduce spending. but wielding a meat axe arbitrarily across the federal budget does  make sense. you have to make a linebyline. programbyprogram. even projectbyproject review of that budget to get at the waste or unnecessary programs. let us bear in mind that the agencies we are dealing with in this bill are  the big spenders of the federal government. rather they are the revenue raisers like the treasury department. the irs. the customs service. et cetera. i would guess that if you polled the citizens of this country as to which agencies they think do a good job and in which the public has highest confidence. many of the agencies in this bill would head the list. therefore. i urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report.
. with the exception of the distinguished senator from maines opposition to the conference report. i want to associate myself with the remarks of the senator from maine. i might add that. although perhaps  stated as eloquently. they were the thrust of my arguments in the conference. so i really have hing in the way of rejoinder. except to remind the senator from maine that numbers are what prevail in conferences. and whereas i think the logic of his argument. as well as the facts of it. should have prevailed. the numbers were otherwise. therefore. we have the result before us. which was to raise. in some small measure. both the interest rate on homeowners loans and the interest rate on business loans. but this in way meets headon the problems and issues raised by the senator from maine. there is question as to how this disaster loqn program has grown. there is question but that it requires a thorough review. there is question but that the costs of the program are hidden the way the situation  stands. i would hope that during the course of the next year this matter will be thoroughly ironed out. prior to the next conference. i admire the courage of the senator from maine. it is very easy to step up and demagog an issue. we are in this program giving ease to those caught in the unfortunate maws of disaster. that is . of course. what the senator from maine is attacking. but what he is saying. and i agree with him. is that if we are going to make this kind of commitment. we should understand what the price tag is. i am  sure that for most of us that is the situation. i still think the distinguished senator from wisconsin and the senate conferees did the best job they could on the overall bill. and even made some headway on the interest rate problem. but that in way derogates the force of the arguments of the distinguished senator from maine. even in the light of his arguments. i hope the conference report will be agreed to.
. under the existing merchant marine act. loan guarantees are presently available only for fishing vessel construction. a loan guarantee authority of $75 million is available for this limited purpose. in creating a comprehensive fisheries loan guarantee program. the legisation i have introduced would remove vessel construction from the merchant marine loan guarantee program. under this bill. the new federal fisheries loan guarantees could be used for the construction or rehabilitation and purchase of shoreside facilities as well as fishing vessels. a maximum of $750 million of federal loan guarantees would be available for fisheries with the government authorized to guarantee up to 871/2 percent of the principal on the loan. the merchant marine act would also be amended to include in its tax deferred capital construction funds. shoreside facilities. thus. owners of processing plants would enjoy the same tax advantages as vessel owners. it would allow these owners to defer a portion of their income from taxation provided that the
. this legislation will go a long way toward producing the jobs which are the foundation for urban ecoic development. furthermore. the legislation promotes the involvement of the private sector in the ecoic development of our cities. and it is the private sector.  the government. that holds the key to an effective. lasting solution of our nations urban woes. i urge the support of my colleague for this bill.o by mr. mcgovern (for himself.
. do you want to see what has happened in the meantime. our imported oil bill is  expected to reach $55 billion at current price levels. those statistics that i cited earlier are  up to $55 billion. remember. those statistics i cited were that the foreign oil bill was $2.9 billion in 1970. $3.6 billion in 1971. $4.6 billion in 1972. $8.1 billion in 1973. $26.1 billion in 1974. $26.7 billion in 1975. $34.6 billion in 1976. and 1977 figure was $39.6 billion. and the 1978 figure was $43 billion.  it is going to take over $55 billion. all the comments were made then as to the money going offshore. out of the american pockets. either in the sense of jobs or in the sense of discovery. whatever has happened. but it is  going to take $55 billion. the figure for oil imports is about 8.5 million barrels per day . as compared to 1.5 million barrels per day in 1970. i might add. to make it pertinent to this amendment. the transportation sector receives about 52 percent of each of those barrels of oil for gasoline. later on i will read some of the responses to that amendment 2 years ago. which ultimately ended in its defeat here on the floor. but let us get to the 1979 verision. let us have aher run at it. let us also see how some of those responses will sit. such as we will hear. i am sure. in a few minutes.
. i rise in opposition to the amendment of the senator from louisiana. the people of the virgin islands are  something separate and apart from all of us here in this chamber. although enjoying a somewhat different status. they are very much a part of this nation. the fact is that the tax policies of this nation. and more specifically. i gather. the 1978 tax reduction act. altered the revenue to a considerable extent insofar as the virgin islands were concerned. and additional funds that were contemplated in legislation last year never came to pass for the simple reason that the legislation was vetoed. i do  ice anyone on the floor of the senate. including the distinguished senator from louisiana. advocating income tax increases here in the united states to offset the deficit which we are obviously going to have in this nation. so the logic of that argument. i thinkwhat is the expression. when one comes into court seeking equity. he should come with clean hands. the hands of the u.s. senate in this respect. inbalancing budgets and asking for tax increases. are  exactly spotless. the senator from new york has correctly pointed out that these are poor people. when any of us contemplate the virgin islands. we contemplate them from the point of view of the wealthy americans who go down there and those of our friends who have retired to the virgin islands. the population of those islands has increased. and the increase requires additional government services. with these increases. our tax policies. our failure to give them the money promised in the tax act of 1978. the nature of the population and the population increase. i very much hope this amendment will be defeated. i gather that if it is  defeated. imminent backruptcy faces those islands. this is  something to be just sort of swept off in the course of a few minutes debate when one is on the floor and one has been alerted to the issue. i think that would be rather shoddy treatment of a part of our nation. whatever their special technical status may be.
. i would also point out to my colleagues that for a percentage of the year the gover of the islands was very. very ill. finally dying of cancer. and there was almost a years period where the government was  exactly being run. and a new gover just having taken over within this past year. insofar as giving direction to the general fiscal policies of the islands is concerned. this has been a difficult time for them.
. i. therefore. urge the senate to delete $13 million from edas $96 million requested increase for the revolving fund for steel loan guarantees. since eda has room to manuever within this fund. such action will neither prevent eda from granting the loan guarantee to wheelingpittsburgh  will it interfere with edas ability to proceed on other loan applications for loan guarantees for other steel companies. support for this amendment will send a clear message to eda that the senate has strong reservations about the wheelingpittsburgh loan guarantee application. and that if eda should want to proceed. it should do so with the utmost care. i urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. it is. as a matter of substance. the correct thing to do. it is also a matter of fiscal prudence when such is being demanded by the taxpayers of this nation. i will grant you that politics of this situation are such that my amendment is in danger.  the facts of the situation.  the logic of it.  the fiscal prudence. but the politics. that is all. i hope those politics will be thrown over at this time for some commonsense voting by my colleagues.
. i join the distinguished senator from south carolina in requesting senate approval of the conference report on h.r. 4392. without further ado. i also compliment my distinguished colleague from south carolina on a superb job. both within the committee and in the conference. it is  an easy thing to accommodate all of the various requests of the agencies and do it in a fiscally responsible manner. this has been done by my colleague from south carolina. he has matched fiscal responsibility with compassion and foresightedness. the end product is due. in large measure. to those efforts.
. there can be sacred items in the federal budget.  the conservatives defense spending  the liberals foreign aid. we must recognize that funding for each piece of this budget affects all the others. we must recognize that we are all accountable for the priorities those final spending figures reveal.*
i say to the distinguished majority leader that i want to make the point that the senate will have to go one step further. when the motion to concur in the matter of disagreement comes up. i shall immediately move at that time to amend it. which amendment reads: withstanding any other provision of this joint resolution and withstanding any other provision of law. e of the funds appropriated by this joint resolution or any act for the fiscal year 1980 may be used to pay the salary of any individual in any office or position the salary for which is subject to adjustment under section 601(a) (2) of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 (2 u.s.c. 31) at a rate which exceeds the rate of salary payable for such office or position on september 30. 1978. so it eliminates any pay raise5.5. 12.9. any figure at allfor the congress. period.
. i request that the article entitled. "reduction of tax on capital gains spurs investment." written by edward i. obrien which appeared in the october 31. 1979 edition of the wall street journal and the article by james l. rowe. jr.. entitled "firms hunt funds off wall street." which appeared in yesterdays washington post be printed in the record. the material follows: [from the wall street journal. oct. 31. 19791
suggestion. and i thought it was a good one. i was never treated more warmly in any office than in that of the distinguished senator from connecticut and his staff. i said: i would like to get the chrysler measure up and disposed of without too much delay. what do you suggest. the able senator from connecticut suggested that upon the disposition of the pending excess profit tax bill. the senate proceed to take up the chrysler legislation without any delay on the motion to take up the bill. with the understanding that the cloture motion on the bill itself would  be offered until wednesday. and in the meantime senators could debate the chrysler legislation or. if there was inclination to debate that. from time to time other matters could be brought up and disposed of. and then on wednesday the cloture motion would be offered on the bill itself. this would mean that cloture on the bill would be voted by friday. i think that is a very good arrangement. it allows the senate to have at least tuesday. wednesday. thursday. and friday to debate the chrysler legislation before the vote on the chrysler cloture motion should occur. in the meantime. according to that arrangement. other lesser measures could be disposed of with short time agreements and with unanimous consent. i think this is a very amicable way and a reasonable way to work out this problem. i personally and  publicly want to thank the distinguished senator from connecticut for the reasonableness which he has displayed in arriving at this proposal.
. i rise today in support of the compromise agreement reached by the senate concerning h.r. 3919. the crude oil windfall profit tax bill. at the outset of debate. i was concerned that the finance committee substitute. as reported. was weak and unresponsive to our future national energy needs. however. after almost 5 weeks of negotiations and debate by many members of the senate. a bill has emerged which achieves a fair balance between tax revenues and production incentives. specifically. h.r. 3919. as reported by the finance committee. raised three major concerns. first. the committee legislation captured approximately $136 billion. or about onehalf the total revenues raised by the housepassed bill. this figure was unacceptable and insufficient to meet our future needs. to develop alternative energy sources. and to protect lowincome and elderly persons suffering from price increases due to decontrol. however. after several weeks of debate. and with the adoption of major strengthening amendments. the senate bill will  capture approximately $178 billion in windfall revenues. this increased revenue will insure the development of alternative energy sources and protect lowincome and elderly households. second. the committee substitute. as reported. provided for several unjustified tax exemptions. these exemptions would have allowed oil producers and royalty owners to retain substantial windfall profits at a great cost to the american consumer. however. with the adoption of the ribicoffbradley amendment. a 20percent minimum tax will be imposed on heavy and tertiary recovery oil and a 10percent tax on newly discovered oil. this amendment provides a more equitable tax base. which will  only help promote domestic production but will also substantially increase revenues. third. the original committee "phaseout" would have caused the tax to terminate at a rate of 3 percent per month beginning when 90 percent of the projected revenue of the tax had been raised. therefore. the faster the price of oil rises. the faster the tax would phase out. the senate adopted. however. an amendment offered by the senator from new york
. i ask unanimous consent that the following members of the budget committee staff be permitted access to the floor during the debate on s. 2094: robert boyd. becky davies. gail shelp. susan petrick. and carol cox.
. congress took a promising first step toward reinvigorating our stagnant ecoy when it reduced the capital gains tax rate in 1978. yet our capital gains rate remains. with the exception of great britain. the highest in the west. i urge my colleagues to join in supporting the legislation i am introducing today to stimulate investment in our nations smaller businesses. this will result in a strong and vigorous ecoy by promoting competition and arresting the growth of ecoic concentration.*
. i will respond to some points raised because i think they are important. first. i state that. to me. a lack of education is different in the city than in the rural areas. if. indeed. educational opportunity is lacking in the rural areas. let us add some money to the budget and make sure concentration grants are available for those areas of less than 5.000 children. low income children. those in the poverty level. fine by me. as far as i am concerned. it is  political. i have very few rural areas in the state of connecticut in that category. but that is neither here  there. i could  agree more. who needs a child without an educational opportunity. that is just tragic. matter where it occurs. the fact remains that good education to these children in the urban areasand you can speak for the rural areascosts money. yes. it does. you can get the teachers to go in there.  1. they do  have the physical plant.  2. you need special programs to bring them along and to the level of the opportunity enjoyed by children who have had a far better background and far better educational training. it costs money. i am  saying that you can throw money at a problem and lick it. you need the programs and the personnel. there is point in kidding ourselves that we are going to be able to do this job with the disadvantaged with mirrors or by telling them they live in a far better country because we have balanced the budget and. therefore. they should be educated. i do  wear the hair shirt. as many of my colleagues do. about the miserable job public education has done in this country. i think it has done a fantastic job. as i look around me and see those who have benefited from it and see the jobs they hold. i have apologies. i will admit money was wasted. but the bottom line is. take a look at who is educated and who has the opportunity in this country today. compared to just 30 years ago. 20 years ago. a handful of people went to some private schools. and the others had to live with public education. a lucky few went to princeton or harvard. that is  so any more. a good education is available to a great majority of our citizens. the fact still remains that when it comes to education and the quality of it and the opportunities emanating therefrom. we still are seriously deficient in our urban areas. that is where the concentration of the poor is. those are the ones for whom i speak this evening. indeed. if there are further concentrations in the rural areas. let us get at that problem. also.  i come to the handicapped. the budget committee has made certain assumptions. i make different assumptions. do  forget that when we passed the law. we were going to take care of 40 percent of the excess costs40 percent. senator hollings and senator bellmon. does your budget provide for 40 percent of the excess cost to educate a handicapped child. you believe it does . the committees figure might be a little higher than that of the administrations. they are somewhere around 9 or 10 percent or 12 percent. but that is far short of the 40 percent when we passed the law.  what are you going to dopass the law but  pay for it. even . the disadvantaged and the handicapped are under a tremendous burden because they are looked upon as the cause for diminishing educational opportunity for mal children. since the pie is smaller and the boards of education do  want to respond. so we are going to put a further squeeze here by virtue of what you are doing. you can say. "that was in our asumptions. yes. it means that we were going after ceta. yes. we were going after impact aid." or whatever it is. that is  the way it works out when the pot is divvied up. we talk about inflation. make mistake about it: if you want to get productive moneyi said earlier that productive money is housing. productive money is education. it is  inflation. whether senators are for defense or against defense. there is  one ecoist in this nation or anywhere in the world who is  going to tell you that defense spending is the most inflationary of all. and you are  even going to talk about it. we are going to talk about it. because i am going to talk about it later. to say that education is inflationary. in light of what is being done on the defense side. regardless of systems or dollar amounts. ody will argue that it is  the most inflationary of all. so i will continue to argue for this investment. this is the investment that is going to make us productive. this is the investment that is going to get rid of welfare. this is the investment that is going to be able to take millions out of the federal budget. which  goes in grants and all the rest. and will come back to us in terms of taxes and in terms of a quality of life we can be proud of. i repeat what i said at the outset: what appalls me about this is the change in psychology from a nation that used to live for its children to a nation that. with this kind of spending. wants to live off them. in the sense of what it is  going to have. it is bad and should be changed. i hope this amendment is agreed to
. i had asked for the additional time and objected to the unanimousconsent request only because i was going to withdraw my amendment to this amendment. which amendment would have called for a 1053 right across the board.  just applying to steel and the automotive industries. i am going to withdraw that amendment and direct my remarks in support of the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania. it is ironic to mefirst of all. let me give the cost of the 1053 across the board as i computed it. it is $1.9 billion. according to the congressional budget offce. we are going to spend $1.5 billion just on the chrysler corp.. $100 millionsomeodd for wheelingpittsburgh steel. $90 million for wisconsin steel. and we are  going to attend to the basic causes of the problem which produces the afterthefact money. if you want to k about money down the drain. it is the $1.5 billion to chrysler and the other loans i described to the steel companies. it is far better to spend our money on this type of proposition here. so we do  get to the bailout situations on the floor of the senate. because of the nature of the entire process. dealing with the finance committee. the budget committee. the appropriations committee. on something which is probably going to be the only matter of importance to pass through this congress. we are restricted to discussing these important matters in a matter of hours. in the wee hours of the morning. i hope. if consideration is given to the 1053. consideration will be given to all businesses. indeed. the business most in need of this kind of assistance is small business. the nations 13 million small businesses have  had the luxury of a history of profitable years. they are in their nascent stages. trying to eke out a living. yet they account for 55 percent of all employment. 48 percent of the nations business output and 43 percent of the gnp. in a recently concluded white house conference. this issue was named as  2 in importance by that conference. this is the issue that was  2 in importance. so. yes. i hope the principle will be adopted right across the board. in the long run. it will save a great deal of money and put us in a competitive position visavis imports. that. obviously. is  to be. so i very strongly support the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania. i admire him for bringing it forth on the floor at this time. i only wish it would be given the proper consideration that it deserves rather than the perfunctory glance that is obviously going to take place at midnight.
. it is very unclear how cutting the states share of general revenue sharing will do any good in the fight against inflation. to the contrary. it is quite clear that this cut will do much to exacerbate the problem. i urge that we restore the funds for the states share of general revenue sharing.*
. . i do  believe that we can justify essential spending on defense when essential investment programs in americas people go unfunded. i believe that by passing this amendment we can provide for our long term ecoic and social needs without damaging our short term defense effort. i urge adoption of the amendment. . i wait with great anticipation to hear the defense of the lowest 1.6 percent of the defense department request. i wait with great anticipation the explanation of why we should go ahead and spend $2.6 billion the defense department does  want spent. if. indeed. there is to be fiscal restraint. fiscal oversight. and fiscal responsibility. then it has to apply to the entire budget. and that is clearly  the case in what is being presented before this chamber.
. i have doubt that one looked over these 150 items on the budget committee to decide whether or  they should be eliminated. two and sixtenths billion dollars. this is all nickel and dime business for the pentagon here that we are talking about. there is wayand i am  going to embarrass the senator and ask what he thinks of any of these items. one would be able to go ahead and respond. one hundred fifty items. essential items.  the distinguished senator from oklahoma stands up and talks about dollar totals. dollar totals do  mean anything here. and they should  mean anything to this country. if anybody thinks the more money you spend. the more secure you are. the greater defense you havethat is rubbish. that kind of thinking is going to get us into a hell of a lot of trouble. to give an analogy. i was an artillery officer in world war ii and the united states employed what was kn as indirect fire. they could take six howitzers. place them anywhere on the ground and concentrate their fire into one area. the soviet union used to place their guns on the ground to achieve the same effect at the target end as the guns were positioned on the firing end. so they had to use 100 guns or 200 guns to achieve what 6 of ours could achieve by virtue of the fact that we had the better system. i do  care what the dollar totals are. i care what it is we are getting for the dollars we spend. so to sit up here and talk about percentages and total dollars is meaningless. were it  for the opposition of some of our colleagues. certainly this senator. we would be running this racetrack system of the mx. fortunately. egh voices were heard saying  the dollar argument is meaningless. this is the most unfortunate part of the budget committees operation. though for the most part i compliment them. i k they do  have egh time. that is why it is the job of the appropriating committees and authorizing committees to go over this kind of minutia. this is the basis for my cuts. 150 essential items said by the department of defense to be essential. priority. as i said. i just wish we would come to the conclusion that. yes. certainly. a strong defense will require a commitment in terms of dollars. but i think that far more important in the defense of this nation is the quality of life of its people. we will be in balance on both of these matters. only when our commitments to flesh and blood and the human condition are commensurate with our commitments to research and development and production of weapons. this budget the committee is giving to the senate and the american people is  balanced in terms of principle. it is  balanced in terms of priority. it gives the illusion of ecoic balance. it gives the illusion of security when. in fact. it is the most inflationary type of approach toward our ecoic problem that can be devised. the committee is leaving the price to be paid by future generations so that we can all tiptoe off the stage and say. "we balanced the budget
. i also am prepared to accept the amendments of the distinguished senator from oklahoma and the senator from mississippi . i would ask. unless it is included in the remarks of the senator from oklahoma or the senator from mississippi. that a letter dated may 28. 1980. addressed to senator robert c. byrd. from the office of budget and management. signed by james mcintyre. be printed in its entirety in the record at this point.
reserving the right to object. and i am  saying i shall object. it was my understandingi grant it was only an understanding. there was hing locked inthat upon conclusion of the bellmon amendment and the bradley amendment this morning. we were then going to the issue of general revenue sharing. to which i have an amendment.
i do  want to interfere with the senator from montana. who has a brief amendment here. obviously. he has the way cleared to have it passed. but could we then move to the matter of general revenue sharing. i do  want to wait. in other words. much longer. since this is the principal issue confronting us. i am  desirous. and neither is senator durkin  any of those who share my views in this matter. of delaying the bill this morning. we k it has to go to the house and back. so could we please get going on it.
in response to the senator from indiana. the effect of what i am trying to do is this: if i am sustained. that the committee amendment is relevant. that would eliminate the rescission of $572 million. that having been done. it admittedly opens the amendment to a point of order from the budget committee. at the time the budget committee makes that point of order. i will go ahead and ask for a budget waiver. i have stated exactly what the course of action is going to betricks. that is it.
. i move in accordance with section 904 of the budget control act to waive any points of order which could be raised under titles iii and iv of that act with respect to the pending bill and any amendments thereto.
what has been done here. in effect. is the senator from connecticut offered a motion waiving any points of order by the budget committee that might be raised against the bill because of amendments that have been passed. that is. revenue sharing. in other words. that we are going to bust the budget. i believe that is the expression used by the opponents of the weicker amendment. i say. "bust the promise made." to those who are opponents of the weicker amendment. in other words. that there is $572 million that will be added on here. i have set that aside. in the alternative. the senator from alaska has an amendment which proposes specific cuts to match the $572 million. we wanted our colleagues to k they will have a choice then by their adding $572 million. or matching with cuts the $572 million that was passed in the weicker amendment. that is what is on the floor before the chamber. that is what we attempted to do.
. to spend a great deal of time on this because the choices are very simple: you either go the budget waiver route or there will be corresponding cuts. believe me. in the sense of fairness to all. in the sense of doing the right thing without having all the facts on every item that is in the appropriations bill at your fingertips. the more honest way to go is the budget waiver. this item of revenue sharing means a great deal to many people. e of them individually have the clout to go ahead and get a specific appropriation for their pet interest in life. but. collectively. i think we k the good that comes from this money. it is money. i might add. that involves  just the states but the counties. the towns. and the cities. it is money without the administrative costs of washington. it is money directed toward the priorities in those areas by the people who are affected by the situations within that particular political subdivision. they k best. i would hope that we would do without the second guessing that will attach to any sort of an amendment for corresponding cuts and face up to the fact that what we did this morning has to be paid for. and in paying for it we are  unbalancing the budget because the budget is unbalanced. and in paying for it we are  violating any principles because a mechanism was put in therei am talking about the budget waiverto accommodate human judgment under extraordinary circumstances which exist here . that is it. in short. i anticipate the arguments that will be presented by the budget committee. but this place is  something to be run by the budget committee. it still involves the judgment of each senator. one can use that as a reason for failing to exercise that judgment or the reason for failing to have the courage to ask for the appropriate payment for the exercise of that judgment.
. the distinguished senator from florida mentioned the fact that we passed the concurrent budget resolution. does the distinguished senator from florida also agree that in that concurrent budget resolution was this money for revenue sharing.
i understand that. but it certainly indicates that the commitment was there. was being made. in all forms. whether in the budget committee what have you. that is the issue before us. it is  some wild idea off the wall. it is something that has been there all along. there have been other accommodations made. political specialinterest accommodations. and i think we k what they are. this one was planned for all along. the commitment was there all along. the promise was there all along. so. please. do  make it look as though this is dragging in something beyond the budget process and bringing it up anew before this body. that is  true.
i would like to say to my distinguished colleague and miity leader and friend. i am very much moved by his remarks. both in the sense of accurately describing the condition here on the floor and in relating it to the history of the legislation and in offering a variety of solutions to the predicament in which we find ourselves. i think it is also true that the motion of the senator from connecticut was as much to protect the victory which he had won this morning in a parliamentary sense as it was meant to achieve anything insofar as substance was concerned. i have objection at all to the alternate methods described by the distinguished senator from tennessee. at least. i understand. in conversation with the distinguished senator from oklahoma. that he has developed such a package of cuts to bring the supplemental into line. leaving in place the amendment of the senator from connecticut. that is the reason why i am on my feet. that is the reason why i have been on my feet. most of this day. if it would accelerate a resolution of the problem confronting usi have desire whatsoever. as i stated earlier this morning as i was trying to get through my amendmentto in any way inconvenience the membership or keep this place in session all night long or tomorrow and make it impossible to go to conference. that is  my point. i spoke for revenue sharing and i won on that point. how we go ahead and preserve that amendment. i am certainly willing to accommodate and to compromise whatever way this body deems fit. having stated that. i am prepared for my part to withdraw the motion. however. i want to repeat i am prepared to do so in the hope that there is  going to be an endaround play here. that. in effect. vitiates the action which the senate took this morning on revenue sharing. that is my only interest.
. is minimal. i think we got about 80 percent of the objective. i think that is about as much as any man should vote on this floor. my other concern was on the amtrak funding. it is my understanding. however. that this in way reduces the commitment in capital terms to amtrak. rather. it only creates a fiscal mechanism whereby the money does  get paid amtrak until the bills are tendered. and that is fine. i thank all those who were involved. i feel this was a very. very important step taken in the ordering of our priorities. again. my appreciation to those senators who. i think. showed a great deal of courage in manifesting their wishes on this matter. more particularly. there are still many specialinterest items in the appropriations bill improperly so. they are the result of the fighting of the individual senators. but on this item of revenue sharing. it was an item that attached to every citizen of this country. they did  necessarily have the powerful spokesmen on the committee. but in the voice of the senate. they spoke yesterday. i think that was very much upheld in the amendment that is  offered and i support it.
. i would like to take this occasion to urge the passage of legislation reauthorizing the general revenue sharing program. since its enactment in 1972 revenue sharing has provided badly needed assistance to state and local governments. helping them to meet the evergrowing demands on their fiscal resources. however. the key reason for this programs success has been the flexibility it provides the states and localities in selecting the uses for these funds based on local needs. this has never been more important than during the recessions of 1974 through 1975 and from 1979 through 1980. general revenue sharing has been a model of what federal programs should be in that only a tiny portion of the funds allocated to this program are siphoned off by bureaucratic overhead. in my home state of connecticut. revenue sharing funds have been used to provide such valuable services as police and fire protection. mental health care. library services. and highway repairs. clearly these funds have served to improve the quality of life for the many residents of my state. i commend the senate finance committee for its action in reporting out s. 2574. a bill to reauthorize the general revenue sharing program for 5 years. this farsighted legislation would restore the states share in fiscal year 1982 through fiscal year 1985. some have argued against this provision on the grounds that the states are presently operating with large budget surpluses. however. when this situation is closely examined. one finds that the bulk of these surpluses are concentrated in three states: texas. california. and alaska. those states without lucrative energy. agricultural or mineral resources are generally cutting services and raising taxes in order to keep out of the red. i question. however. the wisdom of changing the entitlement nature of the states share. by making this section subject to yearly appropriations. there is a potential for turning the funding of the states share into a political football. this action could potentially throw the budget planning process of the states into chaos. as inflation continues to ravage our ecoy. it is highly probable that the states will need the assistance provided through the states share of this program. should congress delay the appropriation of these funds. numerous states could be forced to cut back on services. thereby causing additional hardship to their citizens. i commend the action of the finance committee for adding a countercyclical assistance provision to this act. as interest rates are once again on the rise. the longawaited recovery from the present recession is still in the indefinite future. state and local governments are still feeling. and will continue to feel. the effects of the ecoic dislocation caused by massive unemployment and the decline in wholesale and retail sales. until such time as the ecoy is healthy again. most state and local governments will need this aid to make ends meet. as governmental policy has precipitated this recession. so should it help to cushion its impact on the people of this nation. hopefully. the ecoy will soon begin an upward trend and the unemployment rate will decline. at that time. the fiscal condition of state and local governments should improve and there may longer be a need for a states share or a countercyclical provision. however. until that time i concur with the opinion of the finance committee in reporting out s. 2574. therefore. i urge this body to proceed with debate on a reauthorizing bill for the revenuesharing program and pass legislation including the provisions of the finance committee bill.*
madam president. i rise in tribute to gay. ella grasso of connecticut. i served with gover grasso in the state legislature. when she was secretary of state. and when she served in the house of representatives and i i in the u.s. senate. it always was a surprise to those of us who live in the state of connecticut that the emphasis on gover grasso and the position she held was an emphasis based on the fact that she was a woman. i think anybody.  just this senator from connecticut but anybody who resides in the state of connecticut. can tell you that she earned every one of her positions by virtue of her ability. the fact that she was a woman was the last thing that crossed anybodys mind in the state of connecticut. she was possessed of emous ability. compassilon. integrity. and political savvy. there just are  any better to be found in the area of government or politics. in these comments. i express to her husband. tom. and her whole family my respects and my deep affection for each of them. i will miss. sincerely miss. a great human being. if i were asked what i consider her outstanding achievement. i would say it is that she performed her duties as gover during one of the most difficult periods for all the govers of the 50 states. these were times of emous fiscal difficulties. and she brought the state of connecticut thrcugh intactindeed. in excellent shape. people say that she was tough. she wasin the pursuit of good. what she set out to do. she accomplished. in what is sometimes considered a tough profession. i think it can well be said of ella grasso that ody ever laid a glove on her.i so this is in the nature of a farewell to someone for whom i had great affection as a person and deep respect as a professional. politics in connecticut and government in connecticut just will  be the same without her. when the best player walks off the field. it just is  quite the same game. in any event. my heartfelt wishes go to her family. where she is . .she sits in arms of a strength equal to her own.
. what is so instructive ttoout this article is that it suggests directions for ecoic policy formulation a~med at the socalled "older" regions of our country. we must be very careful that the ecomic program to be considered by the congress this year includes policies that enable our nations smaller businesses to continue making their vital contribution to job development and ecoic growth and we must be mindful of the possible regional disparities in the distribution of the benefits of general business tax reduction. and. on the spending side. we must  permit the budget cutters ax to fall too indiscriminately. jeopardizing the community and human resource development efforts so instrumental to the regions ecoic recovery. as chairman of the select committee on small business i intend to do all i can to insure that small business tax reduction is an element of the first tax bill considered in the senate this year. i hope very much to have the support of my colleagues in this effort and commend this important article to them.
. the budget committee has many functions but substance or looking into substance is  one of them. the budget committee deals with the bottom line dollar figure. and i might add that that is the same exercise engaged in by the office of management and budget. it is very clear to those of us on the authorzing and the appropriations committees that the office of management and budget did  look into the substance of programs to achieve the administrations figures. i have quarrel with that. so long as somewhere along the line in this procedure someone does look at substance. the next thing we have are the figures going to the senate budget committee. again with interest in substance. i have quarrel with that. so long as somewhere along the line inquiries are made as to the substance. that time was when various presentations were made both before the authorizing and the appropriations committees. when inquiry after inquiry was made of those representing the administration as to why a particular program is being cut. answer was forthcoming. except that they were given a dollar figure. and that is  a reason. that might be part of the reason in an overall ecoic game plan. but it is  the reason for either excluding or increasing money for a particular program. a particular agency. a particular project. quality should have a bearing on whether those moneys are retained or elimnated. whether or  a particular mission is achieved. quality is a reason for eliminating or increasing moneys appropriated. but substance has been totally lacking from this argument on ecoics and on the budget. on the ecoic condition of the nation. there is a great deal of difference between investments that the federal government makes and giveaways. money that is conceived as going down a rathole. investments that bring a far greater return in terms of productivity. in terms of the gross national product. in terms of the enhancement of the human condition have been totally lost in this argument.  we have before us the amendmcnt of the distinguished senator from rhode island. after much thought and after much precision of inquiry as to substance. he comes forth with this amendment. and we are asked to defeat it in the name of some figure that started off on ths chain fro.n the office of management and budget to the budget committee of the senatea simple bottom lne dollar figure. that is reason to oppose this. why is it that the opponents of this amendment can get up here and say how udag has  worked. they can. because it has. or why the investment in elementary and secondary education has  worked. it has. argument can be made against it. so on down the listin the name of "because the administration sends it to us. because the budget committee set a dollar figure." i have yet to see any rational arguments presented against this amendmentcertainly arguments of substance. earlier in the day. somebody made the comment that this amendment of the distinguished senator from rhode island was business as usual. i will tell you what was business as usual in this whole budget exercisethe fact that the defense department gets its way with nary a question. if you want to talk about business as usual. that is the biggest part of the budget. and that was business as usual. there is  one of us here who feels that if you look into the various aspects of fraud and abuse in the agencies of government. you can apply a percentage to each agency. the difference is that if you talk bottom line figures and apply that percentage to the budget of the defense department. you get the biggest dollar figure at the bottom line. if you are going to scrutinize a budget. if you are going to examine it by a set of criteria that relies on what is achieved. then that scrutiny must be applied right across the board. let me give an example of the contradictions between what the administration is saying in terms of its general policies and what it is doing in terms of ecoics. the administration says that national security in the defense of this nation is of the highest priority. while this administration cuts the budget for education and for science. we are never going to outman the russians. that is a biological impossibility. you are never going to put your hardware hub to hub to the extent they do. the great offensive weapon of this nation. the great advantage we have enjoyed always. sits up here in the minds of americans. which give us techogical superiority. which make up for what we do  have in terms of manpower or in terms of inanimate weapons of conflict. so. while at the same time you are saying that national security and defense are of the utmost priority. you cut back on those budgets that in effect have established the greatest advantage in terms of security and in terms of defense. in terms of our preeminent position in .he world. what kind of sense does that make. where will the techogical superiority of this nation go when you cut back on education. when yott narrow the march si. 1981 scope of what it is our young people can learn. i recall that at the time of the decontrol argument. in the midst of the energy crisiswhich i believe we are still in. and which probably has more to do with our ecoic instability than whatever it is the government is or is  doingi recall during that debate a person saying that we have to up the supply side of energy. and i agreed with that. we have to put the capital into the hands of private enterprise to bring more of the product on stream. i agreed with that. but i said in addition to producing more we have to use less. and there is only one way we are going to do that and that is to conserve. everyone said that decontrol. which i voted for. will raise the price and make people conserve. that is fine. except for those who can afford the price of this basic necessity of life. so it was agreed at that time that whereas we take care of the supply side we would also take very special care of those who would be hurt by that decision. that was the genesis. if you will. of lowincome energy assistance. it was  a giveaway program. it was meant to compensate for aher policy that was agreed upon by this body. they are saying that  that we have decontrol and the capital is in the hands of private enterprise.  let us forget about that whole disadvantaged segment of our society. this is the substance that has  been debated on this floor. this is the substance that was never a matter of consideration of the administration as they went through their budget. but this is what needs to be talked about. this proposal of my distinguished colleague from rhode island is modest indeed. it recognizes the ecoic difficulties that the nation is in and which were also pointed out by our distinguished colleague from massachusetts.
 kennedy favored acrosstheboard supplyside tax cuts. but he also favored the area redevelopment administrationedas forerunnerbecause he knew macropolicy was  egh. this administration would pull the plug completely on one of the best of the targeted programs and leave many regions of the united states waiting for the macro effects to trickle down. this is wrong headed. let us take a look at the arguments put forth by the administration supporting the elimination of eda. first. eda does  create many new jobs. but transfers jobs from other sectors of the ecoy. second. eda support is a substitution for private investment. third. the cost per job saved or created is between $50.000 to $60.000. and fourth. since over 80 percent of the nations population lives in "distressed" areas eligible for eda assistance. the assistance is spread too thin to be effective. a recent cbo analysis conducted for the appropriations subcommittee on state. justice. and commerce. of which i am chairman. provides some interesting facts with regard to some of the criticisms raised. this appraisal looked at periods of assistance provided by eda from 1976 to 1979 and found: first. the private sector would  have provided the same level of investment which we leveraged with eda. according to cbo. 8 percent of edas loan guarantee projects would have gone unfunded. 84 percent of the business development loan programs would  have been created. and 55 percent of the public works projects would  have been undertaken by the private sector alone. second. with regard to costs per job created. cbo tells us that a more accurate measure is: $3.600 to $7.000 per job for the business loan development program. and $10.000 to $12.000 per job for the public works program. third. finally. cbo says that although the areas represented by 78 percent of the nations population qualify for eda assistance. only 25 percent of the counties eligible were actually served and that firms receiving loan guarantee assistance represented only 1.7 percent of all qualifying areas. the results of this analysis are significant because they discredit the broad criticisms leveled against eda by administration officials over the past few weeks. eda is certainly  without fault. i for one have been the strongest critic of the steel loan program. a program which has produced such stellar performances as the $60 million loan default by wisconsin steel. yet. here we have a financial delivery system which has worked pretty well. eda claims that in fiscal year 1980. an investment of $507 million by eda will have saved or created 75.000 to 90.000 jobs and leveraged an additional $2.5 billion in private investmenta 500percent return. if you will. this is a program which works and is working. hand in glove with the private sector. i urge my colleagues to support the mitchell amendment.
. is whether this proposed fiscal plan is appropriate for our country and its future. given its order of priorities and the order of national needs. i conclude that clearly it is . remember that the decisions we make te s 3317  in 1981 will still be felt a decade from . i am  against great experiments but this has the makings of a great mistake. that is why i urge my colleagues to join me in voting against a resolution so lacking in substance. and commonsense. this is a meanspirited venture by a great nation.*
 and the budget committee are about right. however. the mix is all wrong. defense spending is projected to grow atan annual rate of 17 percent over the next 4 years. and by 1985 the 4year net increase in defense spending will exceed the absolute level for 1978. tihe recommended increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1982 is $26 billion. or 18 percent. if we held the increase to 15 percenti percent lesswe could free up $2 billionfor health care. jobs training education. mass transit and science. all of which are vitally important to the american people. one can convince me that $2 billion will buy so much more national security next year that such draconian cuts in defense mal) 12. 1981 programs are justified. and let there be misunderstanding about that point: real defense spending will be cut in the next fiscal year under this budget. we are told that this budget does  really cut government spending. that it merely slows the rate of increase from what would otherwise have occurred. well this is just sense because defense accounts for almost 80 percent ($26 billion of the total $35 billion) of the budget increase over 1981. defense spending would go up by over 6 percent after inflation. while defense would fall by over 6 percent after inflation. so let us  say defense spending will continue to grow. albeit at a slower rate. defense spending. adjusted for inflation. will fall sharply in 1982. and in 1983. under this budget. the entire growth in the federal budget. from $699 billion to $730 billion-$31 billionwill be accounted for by the increase in defense sepnding. from $188 billion to $221 billion. in 1983. therefore. defense spending will fall in absolute dollars and after adjustment for inflation. hing is more important than our national security. the protection of our vital national interests. and keeping our people free. but that does  mean you blindly throw money at the problem to the tune of 17 percent per year. what will that buy. when we are cutting science. techogy and education. brainpower is our only hope for military superiority and national security. surely we can outman the russians. just think how an additional $2 billion could have improved energy supply and conservation. the minds and opportunities of our young people. and the misery of the poor and elderly. our futures will be determined by our investments in flesh and blood.  by pilot programs in ecoic philosophy.
the senator from oregon is correct. for example. we could propose an amendment as a substitute for the helms amendment because we do  like busing. we do  like what the courts are doing to achieve equality of educational opportunities. we can pass an amendment right here saying that congress will appropriate $50 billion. in lieu of the helms amendment. in lieu of busing. that the congress will appropriate $50 billion and go ahead and raise the necessary taxes to pay for it in order to achieve equality of educational opportunities. there is a way to do it. i do  think. quite frankly. it would have many supporters. i just do  see how you can have your prejudices and your wallets intact. i really do . that is where the strain is coming here. someone is trying to find an answer to this problem without any pain whatsoever. either in terms of lifestyle or in terms of dollars. but i want to repeat. because this is terribly important in this debate: this is  a busing debate. i imagine there are a lot of people who have spoken here on my behalf. on the constitutional issue. who do  like busing. that is what everybody is to be tarred with. to be tarred with the busing question so that they will quiver and go ahead and respond politically. "i do  want my constituents to k that i am for busing. that would be terrible." they run as fast as they can. the fact is that the debate here has to do with the constitution. the debate has to do with civil rights. everybodys civil rights. with the constitutional process. the role that we play. and the executive and the judiciary. these are the arguments here on the floor. i only wish somehow i could unshackle my colleagues from the fear that is engendered with the buzzwords that come forth in this issue. i feel that if they had political fear they would do the right thing. constitutionally.
i thank my distinguished colleague from minnesota . i say to my good friend from michigan that i am  going to sit here and belabor his very worthwhile eff ort. there is question about the fact that attention should be paid to this segment of our ecoy. the small businessman. everything heretofore engineered on the floor of the senate. for the last several decades. has been for big business. when we talk about business. it is always big business. so i am  going to say that what he attempts to do is wrong. w6nder the optimum circumstances it would be entirely correct. really i suppose what i say to my colleagues is that what we have before us here is an opportunity to accomplish in the sense of having  only the votes here on the senate floor but also i would imagine the support of the administfation. it is for that reason that i oppose the amendment of the distinguished senator from michigan king that immediately upon the disposition of this amendment the distinguished senator from minnesota. myself. and the distinguished senator from georgia. will offer an amendment which relates to reduction of taxes in the lowest two brackets. with the reduction being 1 percent this year. i percent next year. going from 17 to 15 to 16 and 20 to 19 to 18. that is doable. in conjunction with that i might add will be a further amendment of the distinguished senator from minnesota. which he will describe. and itos on that basis that what is coming behind the distinguished senator from michigan has a chance of passage. i might add it will be the first substantive legislation. taxwise. that has passed that is as a result of the white house conference on small business. if there were ever a conclave that produced a great deal of politics and a great deal of hot air and result. it was that gathering. if we can get this done. the amendment as proposed by the senators i have referred to earlier. that will be the first time that specific tax legislation has been geared toward the simall businessman. so i have negatives for my good friend from michigan. either it is the spirit that prompted his amendment or the substance if it were possible. my opposition to it is based on the fact that we should have something here that is going to go through the whole process and become law rather than just to be able to say that we tried the senator from michigan.
 nixon: he has. acting personally and through his subordinates and agents. endeavored to obtain from the internal revenue service. in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens. confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposes  authorized by law and to cause. in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens. income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. among the most egregious violations of individuals rights were those coinmitted by the "special service staff." a semisecret unit operating within the irs which was charged with collecting information on socalled activist organizations and individuals. because there were limitations at that time on the dissemination of tax return information.
. i am sending to the desk legislation to postpone the effective date of revenue ruling 81216 until january 1. 1983. 1 am pleased to be joined on this bill by my colleagues. senators durienberger. stevens. an-
. i send to the desk. -for appropriate reference. legislation which would amend the revised organic act of the virgin islands and provide certain other authorities affmcting the territories and possessions of the united states. title i of this leglmtion was prepared by the department of the interior as a drafting service at the commnittees request to identify those provisions of the revised organic act of the virgin islands and other provisions of federal law which must be amnended oi modified to allow the proposed constitution of the virgin islands to become fully effective if approved in referendum by the voters of the virgin islands this ember. i would like to e that title i does r necessarily reflect the views of the administration  of the virgin islands although i understand that the administration and the virgin islands have had discussions over the content of the draft. title ii contains four provisions which i feel should receive consideration during this session. the first section would amend the organic act of guam to provide the people of guam with the right of initiative and referendum. identical language was. reported by the house interior committee earlier this year and the administration has  as yet had an opportunity to comment on it. the second section was requested by the gover of the virgin islands in a letter to senator mcclure dated august 27. 1981 in which he requested a clarification of the authority of the u.s. postal and customs services in assisting the virgin islands in the collection of excise taxes. the third provision would defer until the date of termination of the trusteeship the requirement contained in last years omnibus territory measure that personal property owned by the united states in the trust territory be transferred to the local governments. this provision was also contained in the measilre reported by the house interior committee earlier this year. the final provision is an authorization for the appropriation of funds to the secretary of the interior to offset any decrease in program aid to the territories and to reimburse those territories where the federal internal revenue laws operate as a local territorial tax for any revenue occasioned by general federal tax legislation. the purpose of this provision is  to hold the territories harmless. from the effects of either the tax or budget reform._but rather to provide the appropriating committees with sulfficient flexibility to fulfill the plenary responsibility which the congress has for the administration of the territories and insular areas of the united states. unlike the several states. the territories do  have fully developed ecoies. and in some instances do  even have general authority to raise taxes. i would like to emphasize that in introducing this legislation. i am  necessarily endorsing any of the provisions. but rather i am providing a basis for the committee on energy and natural resources to hold hearings and /receive the views of both the administration and insular areas on the subject which the provisions of this bill addresq.0 by mr. stev13ns (for himself. mr. danforth. mr. dole. mr. leahy. mr.
. four premises underlie the "private sector opportunities act": first. that federally funded employment and training programs should be dlesigned prnarily to improve the opportunity of the unemployed to obtali productive jobs in the private sector of our ecoy. where the vast majority of jobs are located. second. that community based organizations (cbos) the private. nionprofit. voluntary sector. and they are 1.1early defined at section 702 of our bill. are uniquely situated to assist in the delivery of private sectororiented employment. training. and employability development services for those most in need. third. that small businesses. which account for 80 percent of the net new jobs created in our ecoy. should be the primary focus of title vii placement and job training activities. and fourth. that private sector jobrelated services ought to be concentrated on unemployed residents of alcai of pervasive ecoic distress--"enterprise zones." if you willlocated within prime sponsor jurisdictions.
may i receive the senators assurances that he will make every effort to consider their status as original contract authorities during the conferees deliberations over fiscal year 1982 transportation appropriations.
 a scapegoat. i do  think the substitute is all that much better. but at least it does  lodge in the executive branch and the federal reserve the solutions to problems which we are  undergoing. i foresee at the present time. in the absence of a reduction of the deficit. a long and hard recession. indeed. what i fear is that we are going to go from high interest rates to high unemployment. then the interest rates will come down. i do  accept that as being valid ecoic policy. it seems to me that rather than pointing a finger we should all be working together on this problem. the senators on the other side of the aisle k that much of what we are feeling  was originated months and years ago. there is point in worrying about that . let us get the interest rates down by whatever appropriate means. maybe it is that the administration has to consider the size of the individual tax cut and do something with it. maybe it is that it has to concern itself with the excessive amounts for defense that it has asked for. i am  saying that any one of these suggestionh is the entire solution. but i k that that solution lies both here on the floor of the senate and down in the white house. i also k that some midcourse correction is required insofar as the basic reagan ecoic policy is concerned.
. the committee recommends $8.630.589.000 in new budget authority for the departments of commerce. justice. state. the judiciary and 21 related agencies funded by this bill. this amount is a net reduction of $992.290.000 from appropriations enacted for fiscal year 1981 for these departments and agencies. and is $169.411.000 below the subcommittees allocation for budget authoritv. the committee recommendation is $130.513.000 below the budget. estimate submitted in march. $449.089.000 above the 1982 september revised budget estimate. and $53.410.350 below the amount provided in the house bill.i the net decrease of $992.290.000 from appropriations enacted in 1981 is due primarily to substantial programmatic reductions. these reductions affect a number of programs including: the ecoic development administration: the maritime administration ship construction subsidy program: the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention program of the department of justice. the business loan and disaster loan making activities of the small business administration: and the legal services corporation. the reduction for these agencies from fiscal year 1981 totals $1.548.784.000. these budget reductions are offset by discretlonary increases necessary to jrnaintain ongoing programa and by selected program increases. program increases recommdnded by the committee include. $117.000.000 for the department of state for the construction of a new embassy in saudi arabia and the completion of proiects in moscow: $23.800.000 for the immigration and naturalization service to restore positions for the border patrol. inspections. investigations. and adjudications. and $22.438.000 for the international communication agency for the construction for new radto transmission facilities for the voice of america. the committee has restored several vital activities that were scheduled for elimination or severe curtailment. these include: within the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. restoration of the following programs: sea grants. anadromous fisheries grants. commercial fisheries research and development grants. fruit frost program. and funds for 20 of 38 weather stations proposed for closure.. within the ecoic development administration. the committees recommendation would insure that all public works projects  in the pipeline will be funded. at the census bureau. the 1982 census of agriculture will be maintained. the committee recommendation restores funding for the public telecommunications facilities grants for public television and radio. furthermore. the committee recommendation maintains support for the regulatory commissions that have been scheduled for a 12percent rollback in the revised september budget estimates. our other principal recommnendations are highlighted on a statement that i ask unanimous consent to have printed at the conclusion of my remarks.
. it is my inclination at this point. after r discuss a few matters with the distinguished senator from alaska. to accept his amendment. let me underline the point i believe hie has already made. i understand that this amendment will :have net outlay effect. since expenditures will be offset by $1.8 million in fees to be collected from fishing vessel owners under section 7 of the fishermens protective act during fiscal year 1982. is that the senators understanding.
. i thank the distinguished senator from wisconsin for his handling of this matter fromn its inception. during the appropriations committee hearings. and to this point in the chamber. it is true that in the formation of any new administration some matters can slip between the cracks and one of those matters was communications between the ncw chairman of the commission and the appropriations committee and the authorizing committee. i also join with the senator from wisconsin in happily stating that those communications are in place v and what is being done here in the chamber shows that they are working and working well. i think the senator from wisconsin also stated with groat clarity my feelings and his own. i k. but certainly mine also as to any change that might come about in the mission of the ftc. but that is a matter to be handled by the legisjative and executive branches in the mal constitutional process and  something to be achieved by virtue of budget recommendations. a reduction to $68.1 million in the fiscal 1982 budget from $72 million is a total reduction of $3.9 million. or 5.4 percent and would require workyear and related operating expense reductions in most commission programs. a limited hiring freeze would be necessary to meet the $68.1 million budget1 million proposal. related reductions in operating expenses would be required. however. nearmal opterations could be conducted. this level wvould be $2.7. million less than the actual fiscal 1981 appropriation-$70.8 million. however. increased personnel compensation costs and major rate increases in space. $1.3 million. and utilities have caused fiscal 1982 base requirements to increase substantially. programmatically. reductions in most cases will be applied across the board and would  adversely affect the genieral thrust of existing commission policy. the commission has stated. in all of the various budget exercises. that it intends to maintain the same proportion of available resources allocated to the two enforcement missionsantitrust and consumer protection. making most of the cuts in enforcement and overhead accounts. but obviously. the agency will be engaged in fewer antitrust and consumer protection activities. this reduced level would allow the continuation of most of the commissions current programs. it does give the new chairman of the commission the flexibility to expand some important areas of critical concernfor example. antitrust investigations of pricefixing and other. illegal collusive activitywhile forcing the curtailing of other less productive areasfor example. the industrywide program in the competition mission. in the consunmer protection mission. this reduction wvid require the commission to become more selective in newv case generation in areais like enforcement of credit statutes but would allow some modest expansion in beniefitcost analyses as required by statute. in sum. the revisqed budget of $68.1 mnillion forces the commission to curtail activities and ecoize in many areas but allows the continuation of basic antitrust and consumer protection programns vital to smanll businesses and consumers. never before has there been a greater need than  for the federal trade coninission. i am confident that its new chairman as hie gets a handle onl the many problems that will be confronting him is going to look long nd hard at what it is that is transpiring in this nation today visavis the concentration of ecoic power. i agree with many of the things. i might add. that he has said in the press visavis previous activities of the conimission which seem to go way beyond the legislative mandate. the consu...er needs to be protected. i think lie hans madc clear hie is going to do that without unnecessarily bogging the commission down in dotting of every "1" and crossing every t." i hope that the working out of this funding. which i might add is a compromise of views as between his initial views. the initial views presented by the administration. and those presented within the appropriations committee. will enable him to do the job and do it well. i accept the amendment. but most importantly. i commend the distinguished senator from wisconsin for a very statesmanlike job here in bringing together this agency of government with the legislative branch. indeed. even though his appointment comes from the administration. and i am sure his philosophy might be akin to the administration. for the most part his contacts with government are going to be with this branch of government and it really just makes sense to get those relationships off on the wrong foot. i congratulate the senator from wisconsin for putting things back on the track.
that is fine. the committees only concern is that ntia  be deprived of the requisite number of employees to process applications and award grants under the program. if the assistant secretary determines that the job can be done by less than 12. then that is fine. i just want to insure that we get these grants out in a timely fashion. as you k. fiscal year 1981 grants were obligated prior to the end of fiscal year 1981. even though $19.7 million was appropriated for this program in that year.
although the temporary commission was authorized well after the congress received the fccs budget requests and the presidents revised proposals. public law 9735 calls on the fcc to house and support its work: upon request of the (temporary) commission. the fcc shall furnish the (temporary) commission with such personnel rnd support services as may be necessary to assist the (temporary) commission in carrying out its duties and functions.. it was clear in the legislative hearing which bore on this temporary commission that the congress expects the fcc to be the conduit for financing the work of this shortterm effort. i understand that the tenporary commission has a budget which requires $400.000. to be matched by a like value inkind support to be contributed by the fcc and other public and private members of the commission. it is our intent that $400.000 should be made available as necessary by the fcc for the research. survey. and analytic work of the temporary commission.
i thank my distinguished colleague from south carolina for his very perceptive and astute remarks. . in a memorandum from the u.s. intrnational communication agency as to the detailed impact of the 12 percent acrosstheboard fiscal year 1982 cut. let me read that section which applies to exchanges:
. youre  balancing that budget." well. i suppose that in this particular instance. it certainly is  part of the balancing act. but i am the one who has to go to those schools. i am the one who has to go to the hospitals. i am the one who has to talk to these people. and i can give them two messages. and i am  going to dolit. so. if every  and then i get nailed at a chamber of commerce meeting. believe me. it is far more rewarding to see what can be done to bring about useful lives in the schools and the other places where these very special people with their various infirmaities convene.  i had a choice to make when this new round of budget cuts came up. it was to either accept a pittance and go along with the subcommittee. or whether to take a stand. and i felt i would rather take a stand. i might lose in the committee but let us get the matter out here on the floor and maybe even if there is a loss here. and i am  sure we are going to lose on all these amendments. but let the case be stated clearly in terms of when the american people have to pass upon what it is that we did. in the case of those who are the beneficlarles of these programs. i am delighted to unbalance the budget in order that there might be some balance as to the worth of lives in this nation.
. revenue ruling 81216 has been counterproductive as it applies to state run umbrella bond programs. adoption of this amendment will put the senate firmly on record that the pooling of these small issue development bonds for qualified companies should go forward. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
mlr. president. i support the finance committees action with regard to the deferral of the effective date of the lifo recapture provision that was attached to the crude oil windfall profit tax act of 1980.- i am an original cosponsor of 8. 1839. which is the genesis of this provision. the identification and valuation of inventories is a constant. complex problem for manly small businesses. this area is also the basis for a very complex set of irs regulations that small businesses must comply with. the choice of the accounting method to be used for tax purposes is controlled by irs regulations. basically. the regulations state that when the production. purchase. or sale of merchandise is an incomeproducing factor. the business must use the accrual method -of accounting and keep track of inventories. therefore. instead of deducting all amounts paid for goods during the year. the business must allocate those amounts paid partly to those goods sold during the year and partly to those goods making up the inventory on hand at the end of the year. the accrual method allows you to deduct the cost assigned to goods sold but the cost assigned to the end.ng inventory can be deducted and must be capitalized and carried on the balance sheet as an asset. these capitalized costs will be deducted in future tax years as the goods are sold. e that the choice of accounting method does  affect the physical flow of goods. just the flow of costs. this is why the accounting method chosen is such an important factor. one accrual method. fifo. or first in. first out. assumes that goods are sold in the sanme order that they are purchased. that is. the costs of the first goods purchased are assigned to the first goods sold. and. the costs of the last goods purchased are assumed to apply to those goods remaining in inventory. here is thc rubif you use fifo in inflationary timestimes of rising prices. the goods you buy early in the year will cost you less than the goods you buy later in the year. and it is the higher. more recent prices. that are assigned to the ending inventory. rememberending inventory is capitalized and put on the balance sheet. the lower. earlier prices are assigned to the cost of goods sol . and deducted f rem income. this results in a smaller deduction for cost of goods sold. higher taxable income and a higher tax bill. in times of rapidly rising prices. this can have a tremendous impact on a small companys cash flow. the company will show more profit for tax purposes than the ecoic profit it has actually earned. the company must pay tax based 011 inflated profits and less money is left to operate the btlsiness on. larger companies frequently -protect themselves against these effects by adopting lifo. or last in. first out. this accounting assumption. accepted for tax purposes but subject to extremely complex regulations. assigns the most recent. higher prices. to those goods sold during the tax year. this results in a larger deduction. lower taxable income. lower taxes. and a larger cosh flow. it should be understood that lifo is  some kind of tax shelter. it just allows a business to deduct an amount closer to the true cost of goods purchased. the other side of lifo is that lower. earlier costs. are assigned to the ending inventory. in fact. if a companys inventory expands year to yea. . which is mal for a growing business. the ending inventory can be valued at very old and very low prices. therefore. a. company on lifo0 often times has inventory that has a fair market value substantially higher than the amount shown on the balance sheet. that difference. essentially. is called the lifo reserve. the crude oil windfall profit tax act of 1980 included v provision which required that a liquidating corporation must recapture the inventorys lifo resor.es as ordinasry income. also. a corporation that sells its lifo inventory in the course of a 12month liquidation miust recognize the inventorys lioreserve as ordinary income. this provis.on. if it becomes effective. will work an unace hardshlip on small businesses. on the one hand. a small business will want to. and should in moit cases. use lifo because it more closely reflects true ecoic income and results in a lower tax bill. on the other hand. however. if the small business man elects lifo. then he must be prepared to part with a substantial portion of the vaile of his business in the form of higher taxes if he ever sells or disposes of his enterprise. and it truly is the small and medium -sized companies that are going to be hurt by this provision. in other wvords. . approval of this deferral is  tie only lifo related problem that must be addressed by this body. tile application of lifo is so complex that many small businesses are deterred from using it. in my view. this whole inventory accounting area needs to be simplified. during the second session of the 97th congress. i plan to introduce important legislation to address the lifo problem. the capital raising problem and other taxrelated problems of small business. in the meantime. however. i strongly urge my colleages to vote to defer the lifo recapture provision for 1 year.0
that is what we are talking about. that is how the american body politic has been weakened. because all of its citizens have  had that same opportunity for education and what lies beyond education. i think. it is clear what has been going on here. if we take a careful look at the record and put it all together in these difficult times. in times past it was very difficult. to get the big picture because each individual fact was so spectacular. the same is true right  with the issue that confronts us. it has gone on for about the past year. the voting rights act is being watered down. leave that off by itself. but then let us hook it up to other things that are happening. funding for the equal employment opportunity commission is cut back. arthur flemming. one of the most articulate and committed individuals to the cause of civil rights. was dismissed. there are tax exemptions for segregated schools.  this type of legislation on the floor comes up. put it all together and what does it spell. it is pretty clear to me. this is  some sort of a strategic withdrawal of the commitment to civil rights and individual rights. it is an absolute rout. i for one stand here with many of my other colleagues saying that this is what is wrong. indeed. greatness lies in that particular act. this is best phrased in more constitutional terms. however. by a report of the association of the bar of the city of new york. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the report of the association of the bar of the city of new york in its entirety.
to respond. the senator from new mexico has always been restrained in the sense that he felt obligated to work only within the budget of the subcommittee which he chairs in appropriations. some of us on the appropriations committee have felt all along that that should  be the case. indeed. that there were other agencies of government which could give up some to the extent that it would add to those areas of need under the jurisdiction of the senator. the senator has been absolutely consistent. that he felt that that should  be the case. i have argued the opposite point with him. i do  feel that i am going to balance the budget within the committee of the senator. i have never tried to say that it would be done within his committee. which. admittedly. handles a very large portion of the budget. i have to repeat that the amounts which are sought to be met in this legislation were clearly established as being valid. indeed. if anything. they fell short of the real need. the figures were agreed upon.  all we are trying to do is to assure the fact that the money will be available for those in need. i would hope this body would make it clear that energy assistance is a priority of this government and that we are  going to wait. the senator and i have come to grips in the past on how long we can wait in various instances. i cited one program. if the senator will recall. during the committee hearings when the senator admitted it was a good program. the early intervention program. but that it had to wait in line until times were better in an ecoic sense. i turned to the senator and indicated that the unavailability of early intervention at this point was  something that could be caught up later down the line. but rather. would permanently impair the future of many retarded children. i say the same thing . these people can wait until next week and next month. these matters have to be addressed . believe me. i respect the commitment of the senator to fiscal responsibility and to the balanced budget. which. of course. has gone out the window. but what i am  going to do is to see all of that achieved at the expense of humanity in this country. people are freezing . the winter is . it is kn that  all the states have the resources to which the senator has referred. they do  have the resources. the fact is that children can wait. in other words. for a year or two until the times are better when they can avail themselves of those programs which the senator will assist. we have to address ourselves  to the problems of this country. insofar a. this particular problem is concerned. this particular group of our citizens. this does so. i feel it certainly is an emergency and it certainly does deserve our attention . it can wait until the recess. until the hearings are held. until after the other matters. such as social matters that we have out here. the williams matter. and all the rest. i say to my good friend from new mexico. i will be glad to take him to lunch or wherever if this matter that we speak of is resolved before the spring. it will  be resolved before the spring and the senator ks it.
i agree with the senator from massachusetts that while we have this attention it is better to address these issues. promises have a way of never coming to pass. when we talk about letting the states divert their moneys. i think this: is anybody lacking any funds whatsoever in the defense department. everybody is spending funds like water. with thought of any moneys running out at all. i understand as of this time alabama has used up 80 percent of its moneys. in delaware the moneys will be gone by the end of february. and in idaho there is a 75percent cut. e of these statistics apply to the moneys in the defense department. e of them. they have all they want. i am  one to go ahead and deiagog against the department of defense all the time. and i have  done so during the course of my senatorial career. but this scenario with the budget for 1982 and what has just been proposed is just plain disgusting. it is brital. it is disgusting. and it is wrong. this flesh and blood is a damn sight more important than a hand grenade. an m1. an airplane. or anything. a damn sight more important. i would like to see us address this subject with the urgency and the priority that this administration. a majority of this senate and a majority of the house. has given the weapons systems of the united states of america. in the final analysis. believe you me. if we do  have people who are housed and fed. warm in the winter. educated. and have the opportunities for jobs. we are in plenty bad shape when it comes to the defense of the united states. even on that basis i would say the money is well spent. in any event. i do k this: this is hing unusual. it was all agreed upon. yes. i am going to cast my vote in favor of this amendment because i believe when people give each other their word they keep their word. this is doing more than what the administration promised. and i am  going to let the administration off the hook by virtue of some questionable fiscal procedures that we have utilized here in the senate during the course of the last several months.
. for the agencies funded under chapter ii of this bill. the administration has requested $171.294.000 in appropriations. of which $40.000.000 was proposed by transfer from an account under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations subcommittee. the committee recommends an appropriation of $151.086.000 in new budget authority and $12.550.000 by transfer to meet these program needs. in addition. the committee recommends the rescission of $2.000.000 in foreign currency gain which is excess to the fiscal year 1982 program requirements of the board for international broadcasting. thus. the committees recommendation for program supplementals is $7.658.000 less than the budget request. in title ii. the committee recommends $133.733.000 in new budget authority to meet agency pay requirements. the amount recommended is $114.000 more than the administrations request and is $5.945.000 less than the house allowance. the highlights of the committees recommendation follow.
as a matter of clarification. is it the intention of the appropriations committee that the funding level for special projects (sec. 310316). and projects with industry and business opportunities for handicapped individuals authortned under the rehabilitation act. be continued at least at the same level. and- in the same proportion as in fiscal 1982.
further. is it the intention of the committee that the level of funding for each program and project under the education of the handicapped act continue at least at the same level and in the same proportion as in fiscal 1982.
given the unique status of these socalled orphan bridges. the millions of dollars that have been spent on rehabilitating the theast corridor. the limited budgets of the states and amtrak. and the need to address this critical safety problem. would you consider supporting funding under the jobs stimulus program in conference.
 for designating the participating agency has elapsed. in this way. we hope to avoid the eroding effect which substantial time delays made the last pilot program subject to. at this point. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a letter which i sent to the chairman of the budget committee. as ed in this letter. the reauthorization of this program will  require the appropriation of any additional funds to the sba budget. implementation costs are expected to be absorbed by the affected agencies and additional costs to the government are anticipated as a result of this legislation.
. in the opinion of the committee. passage of s. 272 will  have any budgetary effect in fiscal year 1983 or fiscal year 1984. i so ified the chairman of the budget committee about the budgetary aspects of his legislation and ask unamimous pnsent that my letter on this subject be inserted in the record at this point.
mr. presiden would like to annce for the ir mation of the senate and the pu that the hearing previously sched before the subcommittee on en conservation and supply on the fi year 1984 budget for energy conse tion and related programs within jurisdiction of the subcommittee tuesday. march 8. will begin at a.m. instead of 10 a.m. staff con. mr. tom winn at 2240613. in addition. the subcommittee scheduled a hearing to consider s. to amend section 1(a)(1) of public 95348 (92 stat. 487) to authorize appropriation of $4.038.000 for ca improvement projects on guam fiscal year 1984. this hearing will be held on tuesday. march 8. be ning at 9:30 a.m.. following the ab mentioned budget hearing. staff tact: mr. jim beirne at 2242564. the hearings will be held in r sd366 of the dirksen senr.te 0: building.
. the committee has objection to this amendment. indeed. the remarks made by the distinguished senator from indiana very well describe the amendment and the situation and a portion of the remedy for what obviously would  slow down the intent of this legislation in terms of providing jobs for those out of work. so with that in mind i suggest if the distinguished senator from indiana
i agree. with the senator from utahs concern for the vocational training needs of the most unskilled. disadvantaged individuals among the unemployed. the programs most directly aimed at serving these individuals are in the process of being shifted from administration primarily by cities and counties to the govers. effective october 1. 1983. it is doubtful govers will be ready to implement these programs before october. and existing projects are being phased out. appropriations under title ii of the nvs law should therefore wait until che regular fiscal 1984 laborhhs bill. as proposed by the president. and as contemplated by the job training partnership act. i assure the senator from utah that i will give careful attention to adequately providing for these title ii services during consideration of the regular fiscal 1984 labor. hhs appropriations bill.
. i wonder if my friend. the distinguished senator from michigan. would consider splitting the amount that is involved here. i k the distinguished senator from mississippi feels very strongly as to the subject matter of the amendment of the distinguished senator from michigan. i am sure he is joined certainly by me and others on this floor. by the same token. we do have certain fiscal constraints that we have to recognize. i wonder. instel. -f the $50 million addition that is being recommended here. if we might  split the difference and suggest that the amendment might be modified to include an additional $25 million for employment for the senior citizens.
. i hope my good friend from wisconsin will do everything he can to arrive at some accommodation here with the majority leader and the chairman of the finance committee. i say that because i believe there is one miscalculation being made. i keep reading how the senator from wisconsin has the votes to pass this. i want to point out. speaking for this senator. i voted against this tax bill. voted against it last summer. everything included. including withholding. i am  committed to voting for the senator from wisconsin. i think there may be quite a few of us here. on the floor. who are in that position. if those votes are being counted as being for the senator from wisconsin. i think that is the miscalculation. ody has contacted me. i would hope that everybody would make sure as to what it is they have in their folder here before they go ahead and harde them. i would hope. just as put forth by my good friend. bos dole. that we get as good as we can. which is the jobs bill. i hope my good friend from wisconsin will worry about stripping it when we get into conference so we get a jobs bill. but more importantly. i am saying this as a friend of the good senator from wisconsin. let us see if we can work this out among ourselves. i think it should be worked out. i am  so sure any of us would like to see this harded to an immediate vote. it might just operate to the detriment of the senator from wisconsin.
s proposals. the funding for these programs would shrink to an unacceptably small sliver of the federal budget. finally. our alternative budget would repeal two costly and ineffective features of current tax policyindexing and the third phase of the individual tax cuts due this july. i might add that i believe that our proposal responds to the real concerns of our constituents. i do  hear repeated pleas for guaranteeing the third year of the tax cut or for the need to index personal income taxes. however. each and every time i visit connecticut. i do hear about the need to lower personal interest rates and create jobs. this proposed budget responds directly to these key concerns by lowering the proposed budget deficit. two years of cuts have failed to stimulate the ecoy. i believe lower deficits will. it is my sincere belief that this alternative offers options for spending and tax policy that are worthy of the most serious consideration by our colleagues. although it is the work of five republicans. i believe it to be the real will of the people.
ial water around here with all the differences that already exist among my colleagues. by the same token. i am sure that there is a democratic position. a democratic position that people. some people. would like to adhere to. to the embarrassment of republicans and that obscures their vision and obscures their vision of the facts and logic and commonsense. so really it boils down to whether or  a majority of us are just going to exercise good judgment. and regardless of the advantages to democrats or the minuses to republicans or the other way around all that pretty much washes out. the fact is the big deficits are there and i do  think any of us can live with that regardless of any political direction. we can live with it. our constituents can live with it. certainly we need an increase in defense spending. but even that has to moderate in terms of an overall picture. when it comes to the various spending matters those have been attended  too well by this chamber. i think the time has come to go ahead and just direct our own logic. our own kledge of the facts. toward the vote that is coming up. and. as i said. there will be political pluses and minuses on both sides and they are going to wash and let us get a budget. a budget of commonsense. a budget of moderation. one that the senate has executed and then. fine. let the white house- execute- its will. let the house execute its will. we have done our job in good conscience and in good faith and i support the amendment of the distinguished senator from washington.
. this amendment will provide the action agency with funds to meet that portion of the october federal pay raise that can be absorbed within the existing fiscal 1983 appropriation. the administration belatedly submitted this pay supplemental just prior to floor action on the pending bill. it is my understanding that the funds are needed to maintain agency operations and to avoid furloughing staff. i urge adoption of the amendment.
. a group of moderate republicans and i undertook an effort to reduce the massive deficits proposed by the white house. with the passage of the conference report on the first concurrent budget resolution. 75 percent of our objective was realized with the revenue targets. domestic spending. and defense reductions included in that measure. through the subsequent reconciliation process we may achieve close to 100 percent of our goal. this was  something that was achieved by confrontation with the senate leadership. this was  the product of political exercises such as this one engineered by the democrats. it was accomplished through accommodation and compromise among senate republicans. i for one am proud of what has been done and want to continue the process by which these matters can be worked out within the republican party.
. i say to my good friend. the majority leader. i did discuss the matter with him. i have objection to the unanimousconsent request laying aside the pending business and moving on to the budget waiver. it is my understanding  that the motion we have. the motion to proceed. is debatable and could require a rollcall vote if requested. it seems to me there is egh business to do here without inconveniencing the members at this juncture. i fully expect. however. to use the 1 hours time. and there might be a motion made during the course of that. so. with that understanding. i am prepared to proceed at this time.
page 12. the estimated costs to the federal government. you have in there fiscal year 1984. $5 million. in the bill which you have here before the senate. "this act shall enter into effect on october 1. 1984." that would mean in other words. we are talking about fiscal year 1985. i was wondering. in other words. are we talking about an expenditure of v funds in fiscal 1984 as called for by the report or an expenditure of $5 million in fiscal year 1985 as is in the legislation before the senate. that is obviously a very serious discrepancy.
but to my good friend from illis the report is supposed to jibe with the bill before the senate maybe some staff errors occurred. would the distinguished senator from illis care to amend his legislation in order to have it properly set forth as to what we are talking about. fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985.
yet the bill calls for fiscal year 1985. so there is a mistake and that is why i am trying to be of assistance to my good friend from illis suggesting this bill be reconrmitted. obviously drawn up in haste for whatever reason. to accommodate the administration. to accommodate members of the committee. but obviously drawn up in haste and in error. and this will afford the committee an opportunity to square out the report with the bill before the senate.
i thank the chair. in essence. section 401(c)(2)(c) describes an entitlement. i asked the american law division of the congressional research service to analyze section 6 of s. 602 to verify my suspicions that this does. indeed. create a new entitlement. this is an entitlement. therefore. it is a violation of section 303(a)(4) because section 6(f) states. "this section shall enter into effect on october 1. 1984." this. of course. is fiscal year 1985. and we obviously have  agreed to the first concurrent resolution for fiscal year 1985. let me read the section. if i might.  is that 3 minutes up.
. i am greatly disturbed that this body is apparently quite prepared to take so lightly the creation of a new entitlement. i do  k. short of using the word "entitlement." that section 6(b) could be more clear or definite in creating an entitlement. subsection (b) states: accordingly. the board for international broadcasting shall make payments to the united states radio broadcasting station licensees upon their application for expenses which they have incurred or will incur in mitigating. pursuant to special temporary authority from the federal communications commission. the effects of activities by the government of cuba which directly interfere with the transmission or reception of broadcasts by these licensees. such expenses shall be limited to the costs of equipment (replaced less depreciation) and associated technical and engineering costs. this says "shall make payments." it does  say "may make payments." it says "shall." in way do subsections (c) and (b) take away from the strength of this entitlement. subsection (c) merely points out that "the board for international broadcasting shall issue regulations and establish procedures for carrying out this section ** 0." this does  suggest that the board has any disgretion whether or  to make payments. only that it shall decide how to carry out this mandate. sub. section (d) only sets out how much shall be available to carry out this obligation of the united states during fiscal year 1985. it does  in any way erode the force of subsection (b) which establishes an entitlement for broadcasters harmed by interference. therefore. i urge my colleague to send this resolution back to the budget committee so that they can reconsider this apparent violation of the budget act.
ial commission to fashion a bipartisan approach to dealing with the deficit.. i say to you today: we already have just such a bipartisan approach. it is called the fiscal year 1984 budget resolution. which was the result of weeks of back and forth between members of congress of both parties. its broad outlines are identical to the budget proposed by senators chafee. hatfield. mathias. stafford. and myself. and. along with senator andrews and other of our colleagues. we are committed to seeing this thing through. the finance committee needs a lot of moral support for the tough task of raising taxes. members of congress do  enjoy raising taxes anymore than constituents enjoy paying them. but the alternatives are so frightening that action by finance and by congress as a whole is a must. we say to finance: give us something to work with. and to our colleagues: let us roll up our sleeves. get to work and fulfill our reconciliation responsibilities. we are in danger. in this country. of allowing the nation of repreaentative government to languish in favor of government by commission. if that is the case. then the relevant point is  that the budget resolution is a dead cat. as one of my colleagues put it. but that the congress of the united states is a dead institution.
madam president. i thank my good friend and colleague and ranking member. senator pmire. hing that is before us today would have been possible without his help. he. likewise. comes from a tradition of understanding and compassion for all the elements of this particular appropriation. from education. to science. to various social problems. certainly. lic has always been a watchdog of the treasury. there is question about that. but he combines that fiscal responsibility with a conscience excelled by few. i thank him very much for having brought uts to this point. madam president. before making the usual motion to adopt the committee amendments. i am informed there is a printing error in connection with the amount on page 24. line 4. 1 ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be modified to correctly show that the committee deleted $62.744.000 as provided by the house and inserted in lieu thereof $67.744.000.
it is our understanding. from the department of educations general counsel. that this language is needed to unfreeze the appropriately $50 million in fiscal year 1983. and an undetermined amount in fiscal year 1984. that a chicago federal judge has frozen in order to satisfy the federal obligation in the desegregation case. u.s. against the board of education of the city of chicago. the continuing resolution includes a provision which appropriates $20 million forthis purpose from uligated guaranteed student loan funds. my concern in offering this amendment is for those education programs which are being denied funding because their funds have been frozen pending the outcome of this case. such programs affected are: follow through. womens educational equity. civil rights training. aid to the virgin islands and territories and the secretarys discretionary fund. according to the department. these frozen funds would remain available beyond fiscal year 1983 by virtue of their being held over by the judge. if additional funds are required to satisfy this case beyond the $20 million available. we will certainly do whatever we can to provide these funds at the. appropriate time.
. i appreciate the concerns of the senator in this area. again. i have to repeat that the appropriation is $425 million for fiscal year 1984. and the carryover was $68 million. and we will have a 1984 program level of $493 million. this is well above the appropriation for fiscal 1983. i hope it would meet with the approval of the distinguished senator from rhode island.
but the fact is that we are standing on the threshold of achieving legislation whereby the senate of the united states is a full partner and an independent partner in setting the funding priorities of this nation. that must have some sort of a dollar value. also. i have talked with my friends in education as they have tried to persuade me to support this amendment and indeed they have been good to me. both in terms of their advice with respect to my legislative duties and in terms of their political support. but i asked them the same question about whether or  the time has come for us to be in a position where we can exaine the needs of our times and act upon them. or whether or  we can meet the needs of our times with legislation that is 5 years old. . i will make a point of order that the pending amendment is in violation of rule xvi. paragraph 1. in that it increases appropriations already contained in the bill which does  carry out the provisions of any existing law. treaty. resolution passed by the senate this session or budget estimate. i repeat i do  in any way want to cut off additional comments by my friends but as soon as that comment is forthcoming i would appreciate it if we could get on with the many other priorities that are contained in this bill.
. i appreciate the. good faith efforts on the matter beiiig raised before the senate. on the other hand. i have to point out that this matter has  been raised before the full appropriations subcommittee or indeed the subcommittee which has jurisdiction. it is my understanding that the matter was raised before the office of management and budget and the administration. and they indicated negatively toward having this amount on this bill. i am  anxious to get here and subject my colleagues to a rollcall vote which i think would be very unfair in the sense of my demanding from tl .m or asking them for cooperation in trying to get a bill. and have that across. if you will. from the merits as presented by the distinguished senator from missouri. it would be unfair indeed. i think all of us if we can get administration agreement. if it goes through the process. would support what is being asked. there would be question about it. so why get bogged down and make it difficult for the colleagues on both tides of the aisle in the sense of this particular request. so i want to make it clear. as i have on itemsmaybe even set a new trend in the senateyou pretty well k what is coming out of conference and what is staying in the bill. and i will go ahead and take this amendment and i am going to say it publicly. i am plagiarizing my good friend russell long. i have a feeling it is going to get lost between here and the house.
. under the bill. funding for the direct lending activities at sbawith the exception of the mesbic program. and loans for veterans and the handicappedis ellininated. this was done with a great deal of thought and much hard work and consideration. the fact is. that while the direct loan program may be what the sea is best kn for. it has been one of the agencys least effective programs in terms of "bang for the buck." thebusiness of making loans is one that requires considerable manpower and a. ready supply of cashtwo things in short supply in todays ecoy. sba. unfortunately. has neither sufficient personnel or capital to effectively run such a program. in recent years. as the pool of direct loans has decreased. the number of loans and the average size of the loans have also decreased. in fiscal year 1982. the agency made less than half the loans at half the dlollar amount than it made 2 years earlier2.206 loans at a value of $145.5 million. this averages out td about 52 loans per state. at this level. it seems to me ludicrous to tell prospective borrowers that such a program exists and then have so many firms compe ting for so few loans. even those who do get the loans are going to find it does  go very far. the average loan these days is about $50.000. hardly egh to. make any kind of impact in todays ecoy. finally. as tile ecoy has improved recently and interest rates have begun to decline. there is little differential between the cost to a borrower of a direct and a guaranteed loan. direct loans are  being made at 11% percent. this compares to a guaranteed lending rate of 101/2percent (prime) plus a maximum of 21/ percent to 2%4 percent. when interest rates are so comparable. one has to seriously question whether to keep sba in the business of making direct loans. particularly when. if these businesses are to survive. they must begin to establish a track record with a banking institution. and  with the sba. let me quickly mention some of the. other lending activities at the agency addressed in the committees bill. s. 1323 maintains a $250 million authorizations level for the sbas pollution control equipment contract guarantee program. and a $1.4 billion authorization level for its surety bond guarantee program. by udng taxexempt. sbaguaranteed pollution control bonds. sba cool erates with commercial and investmert banks and local and state authorities to make financing available to eligible small businesses for pollution control equipment mandated by environmental regulatory agencies. the surety bond guarantee program is virtually the only program available that provides small business contractors access to bonding. and is vitally needed. aher provision of the bill maintains the eligibility of certain forprofit organizations for assistance under sbas ietaside program for small businesses.  to exceed $100 million for each fiscal year. this action was taken by the committee after we received a report from the sba indiepting that there were complaints from small businesses concerning thle participation of profit sheltered workshops in the program. and that measurable ecoic injury was sustained by small businesses as a result of participation by profits in the program. an amendment. offered by senator dixon. and unanimously adopted by the committee. also provides that sba shall~enter into commitments to guarantee loans. debentures. and other types of financial assistapce in the full amounts provided by lawfaiubject only to the availability of qualified applications. and limitations contained in the appropriations acts. it should be ed. however. that this provision is  intended to require. sea to enter into commitments where the guarantee authorization is  being used because of an absence of applicants. or where the applicants do  meet the threshold eligibility requirements for such guarantees as provided for in the law. the salaries and expenses section of the sba budget covers all of the lending activities of the agency. in accordance with the committees desire to shift the emphasis of the agencys overall focus. and to strengthen many of its lending functions. this bill recommends that $265.5 million be au* thorized for the salaries and expenses portion of the sea budget for fiscal year 1984. the committee assumes that $15 million budgeted for business development expense will be accounted for under the business loan and investment fund. rather than salaries and expenses account. as suggested by the administration. therefore. the committees recommendation is $23.4 million over the administrations salary and expense request in fiscal year 1984. under salaries and expenses. the committee provides an additional $1.8 million for the office of veterans affairs. over and above the approximately $1.5 million remaining from the inital $3 million appropriated in public law 97276 jo establish the office. this sum will be used to cover personnel and administrative costs. as well as to assist the agency in meeting its mandate of giving "special considera. tion" to veteians in the delivery of its assistance programs. also. $500.000 is specifically earmarked for the office ination. research. and techogy to develop a techogy transfer system at sba. this system will be used to assist small business participation in the small business ination research program. as established in public law 97219. a million dollars was appropriated for the development of this program in fiscal year 1983. and this $500.000 will help to continue the progress that has already begun. in fiscal year 1984. the administration requested funding for 3.910 permanent position at sea. as well as an additional 425 temporary position. as of 1982. sbas loan portfolio was $17.9 billion. with 476.022 loans requiring service. it is the committees feeling the congress should recognize the enlormous growth in this portfolio. and allocate. on a permanent basis. the appropriate number of people to handle a fund of this size. accordingly. $15 million is added to the administrations budget request to allow for additional permanent staff needed to accommodate the increased demand expected to result from the guarantee levels recommended in this bill. mr. presdent. that is the summary of the committees authorization request. i think it is fair. i think it is reasonable. and i think it is realistic. most importantly. i think it addresses. in a very constructive way. the programs facing the sab and the small business community in this ecoty. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation.e
. the labor. health and human services education appropriations conference adopted the senate position on funding for the vocational rehabilitation act. it was and remains the intent of the senate that of the $37.600.000appropriated for service projects at least $650.000 continue to be available to the navaho nationas it was in fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 for a vocational rehabilitation grant. the special circumstances of disabled navahos living on reservations require this continuing federal commitment and it is expected that the funds awarded in this grant in fiscal year 1984 be increased at least to account for inflation since the initial grant award in fiscal year 1982. also as the report of the conferees states. $500.000 of the $37.600.000 appropriated for service projects is to be made available under a cooperative agreement for construction of the garden park enterprises rehabilitation center in phoenix. ariz. prompt construction of this facility will substantially enhance the availability of rehabilitation services in the phoenix area.*
on the matter of lowincome energy assistance. which is of just as great concern to me and to connecticut as anybody in this chamber. in the course of my negotiations with the administration on the laborhealth and human services bill which we passed. i had $193 million in my presentation. budget director stockman suggested that we remove that in the sense that the moneys would be available by virtue of the exxon case. it is clear that those moneys are  immediately available. therefore. i had passed in the committee the addition of $193 million to this bill. after we did that. i received a call from the budget director sayingand that was the nature of the background of the letter read by the distinguished senator from alaskathat either by virtue of surplus moneys or a supplemental the moneys would be available. that we are going to do quarter by quarter. that is fair egh in terms of flexibility to get this continuing resolution passed. if we see any problems. then the money will be allocated. but i want to assure everyone of my colleagues on this floor that i will hold myself personally accountable to see that every state is funded at last years level of effort. that was what i envisaged in my original negotiations on luborhhs. in the meeting of the subcommittee. and in the subsequent discussions witn the budget director. that is my response.  one penny short of thatin other words.  one penny short of what ti.- committee did would be acceptable to this senator as we progress with the dispensing of these moneys.
. the amendment i am offering would simply strike the 1984 authorization in this bill. under current law congress may aulthorize and appropriate such sums as are necessary for carrying out the provisions and purposes of the sbdc program. because the bill as currently drafted places a $25 million cap on the program for fiscal year 1984. even though this is a limitation on the program authorization. without a budget waiver resolution. it would constitute a technical violation of section 402 of thle congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974. accordingly. since a 1984 authorization is  necessary. and to insurc expeditious consideration of this bill. thisamendment is being offered. and i ask that it be adopted.
 reagan has proposed some very modest reductions in the defense budget over the next several years. those. however. will  go far toward resolving the root problem. instead of forcing the military to set priorities and to terminate all marginal programs. the proposed cuts will be accommodated within the budget in the usual fashionby stretching out weapons acquisition programs and by cutting combat readiness and force strueture. the approach is wasteful and irresponsible. some may doubt the political feaslbility of my proposal. but surely the people of this country will  long tolerate pentagon buying sprees at the expense of excellence in education. affordable housing. and an ecoy able to compete on world markets. national security is  just a defense budget. it is the sum total of many factors. including quality of life and quality of political leadership. and if we in the congress are to exercise this sort of leadership over defense spending. then the department of defense must be forced to develop an affordable military strategy.
. my preference would be to place the entire increase in excise taxes cr beer and wine in order to restore at least some equity to the taxation of alcoholic beverages. unfor-. tunately. we do  have the votes to accomplish this objective. therefore. i will support any effort to relieve the federal tax burden imposed on the distilled spirits industry. specifically. i enthusiastically support the ford amendment and urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any further distortion in the taxation of alcoholic beverages.*
. i rise in support of final passage of the flnance committee amendment to s. 2163. at this point in our nations history. we must make every effort to reduce the deficit and after all. that is the primary objective of this amendinent. i do. however have two major concerns about the amendment as adopted and would like to share them with my colleagues prior to the conference on this bill.
. the amendment being offered by the senator from new mexico was contained in the senates version of the dod fiscal year authorization bill which passed the senate on june 21. we have objection to its being added to 8. 2489.
. i am prepared to accept the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina. i think the university of th carolina has done especially good work with respect to its association with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. if there is a part of the budget that needs more funding. it is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.
. i again want to emphasize that since the conference report of the 1984 appropriations bill has already approved these higher program levels. additional appropriations are needed or sought.  does the budget committee oppose this action. these higher program levels are consistent with the action taken by the senate in passing s. 1323. and unless the senate acts quickly to adopt this measure valuable assistance to these programs will either be shut off or seriously curtailed. i urge my colleagues to adopt this important measure which will require additional appropriations.
. i am offering this amendment simply to delete a controversial provision of h.r. 6013 which. given the opposition of the senate finance committee and the administration. would seriously delay and prevent any action on this bill. it is urgent. in my judgment. that the senate act quickly to resolve the serious funding problems for the other programs covered by section 1 of h.r. 6013. particularly the sba handicapped loan program which currently has more funds available for loans to the handicapped through the end of this fiscal year unless this bill is passed. therefore. i am reluctantly offering this amendment to delete section 2 of h.r. 6013. the pollution control tax exempt financing provision of this bill. in anticipation that my colleagues will agree to the urgency of immediately implementing the other provisions of this bill which are consistent with 1984 appropriations. i urge the adoption of this amendment. and after its adoption. will urge the immediate adoption of the remaining provisions in h.r. 6013.
. i thank my distinguished colleague from wisconsin for his overly generous remarks. and only want to point out that two parties are responsible for getting this legislation out of the subcommittee and through the committee. that task in terms of leadership. as far as the democrats are concerned. has been on the shoulders of senator proxmire. indeed. both from the point of view of being a fiscal watchdog and again having the compassion to address the needs of this nation. the decomeratic party could have e better than the distin. guished senator from wisconsin.
the senate version of the bill maintains current funding levels of $740 million and $20 million for employment service and targeted jobs tax credit activities. respectively. which are the amounts requested in the presidents budget. nevertheless. i will keep an open mind when we go to conference. with respect to the house increases for these programs. i would certainly  want to see states forced to close any more employment service offices. plague
s budget request to offset inflation. in addition. the senate bill adds $80.400.000 over the budget request for head start. some of which could be used for indian and migrant projects. but it is  specifically earmarked.
the issues the senator has raised are indeed important. and we will consider raising these issues in the fiscal year 1986 budget hearings. although the mounting indirect costs of federal research are a legitimate matter of concern. we must certainly be careful that while addressing that concern colleges and universities are  discouraged from contributing their own resources to the direct costs of research. . i think we are ready to vote unless other senators have other amendments. i move the adoption of the amendment.
. i believe we have fashioned a bill that is both compassionate for the millions of americans that it serves. and fiscally responsible. our recommendations. while retaining the bulk of the new initiatives of priority concern to congress. is still within the budget resolution ceiling for subcommittee discretionary programs. i therefore urge my colleagues to adopt these conference report recommendations.
 for designating the participating agency has elapsed. in this way. we hope to avoid the eroding effect which substantial time delays made the last pilot program subject to. at this point. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a letter which i sent to the chairman of the budget committee. as ed in this letter. the reauthorization of this program will  require the appropriation of any additional funds to the sba budget. implementation costs are expected to be absorbed by the affected agencies and additional costs to the government are anticipated as a result of this legislation.
. in the opinion of the committee. passage of s. 272 will  have any budgetary effect in fiscal year 1983 or fiscal year 1984. i so ified the chairman of the budget committee about the budgetary aspects of his legislation and ask unamimous pnsent that my letter on this subject be inserted in the record at this point.
mr. presiden would like to annce for the ir mation of the senate and the pu that the hearing previously sched before the subcommittee on en conservation and supply on the fi year 1984 budget for energy conse tion and related programs within jurisdiction of the subcommittee tuesday. march 8. will begin at a.m. instead of 10 a.m. staff con. mr. tom winn at 2240613. in addition. the subcommittee scheduled a hearing to consider s. to amend section 1(a)(1) of public 95348 (92 stat. 487) to authorize appropriation of $4.038.000 for ca improvement projects on guam fiscal year 1984. this hearing will be held on tuesday. march 8. be ning at 9:30 a.m.. following the ab mentioned budget hearing. staff tact: mr. jim beirne at 2242564. the hearings will be held in r sd366 of the dirksen senr.te 0: building.
. the committee has objection to this amendment. indeed. the remarks made by the distinguished senator from indiana very well describe the amendment and the situation and a portion of the remedy for what obviously would  slow down the intent of this legislation in terms of providing jobs for those out of work. so with that in mind i suggest if the distinguished senator from indiana
i agree. with the senator from utahs concern for the vocational training needs of the most unskilled. disadvantaged individuals among the unemployed. the programs most directly aimed at serving these individuals are in the process of being shifted from administration primarily by cities and counties to the govers. effective october 1. 1983. it is doubtful govers will be ready to implement these programs before october. and existing projects are being phased out. appropriations under title ii of the nvs law should therefore wait until che regular fiscal 1984 laborhhs bill. as proposed by the president. and as contemplated by the job training partnership act. i assure the senator from utah that i will give careful attention to adequately providing for these title ii services during consideration of the regular fiscal 1984 labor. hhs appropriations bill.
. i wonder if my friend. the distinguished senator from michigan. would consider splitting the amount that is involved here. i k the distinguished senator from mississippi feels very strongly as to the subject matter of the amendment of the distinguished senator from michigan. i am sure he is joined certainly by me and others on this floor. by the same token. we do have certain fiscal constraints that we have to recognize. i wonder. instel. -f the $50 million addition that is being recommended here. if we might  split the difference and suggest that the amendment might be modified to include an additional $25 million for employment for the senior citizens.
. i hope my good friend from wisconsin will do everything he can to arrive at some accommodation here with the majority leader and the chairman of the finance committee. i say that because i believe there is one miscalculation being made. i keep reading how the senator from wisconsin has the votes to pass this. i want to point out. speaking for this senator. i voted against this tax bill. voted against it last summer. everything included. including withholding. i am  committed to voting for the senator from wisconsin. i think there may be quite a few of us here. on the floor. who are in that position. if those votes are being counted as being for the senator from wisconsin. i think that is the miscalculation. ody has contacted me. i would hope that everybody would make sure as to what it is they have in their folder here before they go ahead and harde them. i would hope. just as put forth by my good friend. bos dole. that we get as good as we can. which is the jobs bill. i hope my good friend from wisconsin will worry about stripping it when we get into conference so we get a jobs bill. but more importantly. i am saying this as a friend of the good senator from wisconsin. let us see if we can work this out among ourselves. i think it should be worked out. i am  so sure any of us would like to see this harded to an immediate vote. it might just operate to the detriment of the senator from wisconsin.
s proposals. the funding for these programs would shrink to an unacceptably small sliver of the federal budget. finally. our alternative budget would repeal two costly and ineffective features of current tax policyindexing and the third phase of the individual tax cuts due this july. i might add that i believe that our proposal responds to the real concerns of our constituents. i do  hear repeated pleas for guaranteeing the third year of the tax cut or for the need to index personal income taxes. however. each and every time i visit connecticut. i do hear about the need to lower personal interest rates and create jobs. this proposed budget responds directly to these key concerns by lowering the proposed budget deficit. two years of cuts have failed to stimulate the ecoy. i believe lower deficits will. it is my sincere belief that this alternative offers options for spending and tax policy that are worthy of the most serious consideration by our colleagues. although it is the work of five republicans. i believe it to be the real will of the people.
ial water around here with all the differences that already exist among my colleagues. by the same token. i am sure that there is a democratic position. a democratic position that people. some people. would like to adhere to. to the embarrassment of republicans and that obscures their vision and obscures their vision of the facts and logic and commonsense. so really it boils down to whether or  a majority of us are just going to exercise good judgment. and regardless of the advantages to democrats or the minuses to republicans or the other way around all that pretty much washes out. the fact is the big deficits are there and i do  think any of us can live with that regardless of any political direction. we can live with it. our constituents can live with it. certainly we need an increase in defense spending. but even that has to moderate in terms of an overall picture. when it comes to the various spending matters those have been attended  too well by this chamber. i think the time has come to go ahead and just direct our own logic. our own kledge of the facts. toward the vote that is coming up. and. as i said. there will be political pluses and minuses on both sides and they are going to wash and let us get a budget. a budget of commonsense. a budget of moderation. one that the senate has executed and then. fine. let the white house- execute- its will. let the house execute its will. we have done our job in good conscience and in good faith and i support the amendment of the distinguished senator from washington.
. this amendment will provide the action agency with funds to meet that portion of the october federal pay raise that can be absorbed within the existing fiscal 1983 appropriation. the administration belatedly submitted this pay supplemental just prior to floor action on the pending bill. it is my understanding that the funds are needed to maintain agency operations and to avoid furloughing staff. i urge adoption of the amendment.
. a group of moderate republicans and i undertook an effort to reduce the massive deficits proposed by the white house. with the passage of the conference report on the first concurrent budget resolution. 75 percent of our objective was realized with the revenue targets. domestic spending. and defense reductions included in that measure. through the subsequent reconciliation process we may achieve close to 100 percent of our goal. this was  something that was achieved by confrontation with the senate leadership. this was  the product of political exercises such as this one engineered by the democrats. it was accomplished through accommodation and compromise among senate republicans. i for one am proud of what has been done and want to continue the process by which these matters can be worked out within the republican party.
. i say to my good friend. the majority leader. i did discuss the matter with him. i have objection to the unanimousconsent request laying aside the pending business and moving on to the budget waiver. it is my understanding  that the motion we have. the motion to proceed. is debatable and could require a rollcall vote if requested. it seems to me there is egh business to do here without inconveniencing the members at this juncture. i fully expect. however. to use the 1 hours time. and there might be a motion made during the course of that. so. with that understanding. i am prepared to proceed at this time.
page 12. the estimated costs to the federal government. you have in there fiscal year 1984. $5 million. in the bill which you have here before the senate. "this act shall enter into effect on october 1. 1984." that would mean in other words. we are talking about fiscal year 1985. i was wondering. in other words. are we talking about an expenditure of v funds in fiscal 1984 as called for by the report or an expenditure of $5 million in fiscal year 1985 as is in the legislation before the senate. that is obviously a very serious discrepancy.
but to my good friend from illis the report is supposed to jibe with the bill before the senate maybe some staff errors occurred. would the distinguished senator from illis care to amend his legislation in order to have it properly set forth as to what we are talking about. fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985.
yet the bill calls for fiscal year 1985. so there is a mistake and that is why i am trying to be of assistance to my good friend from illis suggesting this bill be reconrmitted. obviously drawn up in haste for whatever reason. to accommodate the administration. to accommodate members of the committee. but obviously drawn up in haste and in error. and this will afford the committee an opportunity to square out the report with the bill before the senate.
i thank the chair. in essence. section 401(c)(2)(c) describes an entitlement. i asked the american law division of the congressional research service to analyze section 6 of s. 602 to verify my suspicions that this does. indeed. create a new entitlement. this is an entitlement. therefore. it is a violation of section 303(a)(4) because section 6(f) states. "this section shall enter into effect on october 1. 1984." this. of course. is fiscal year 1985. and we obviously have  agreed to the first concurrent resolution for fiscal year 1985. let me read the section. if i might.  is that 3 minutes up.
. i am greatly disturbed that this body is apparently quite prepared to take so lightly the creation of a new entitlement. i do  k. short of using the word "entitlement." that section 6(b) could be more clear or definite in creating an entitlement. subsection (b) states: accordingly. the board for international broadcasting shall make payments to the united states radio broadcasting station licensees upon their application for expenses which they have incurred or will incur in mitigating. pursuant to special temporary authority from the federal communications commission. the effects of activities by the government of cuba which directly interfere with the transmission or reception of broadcasts by these licensees. such expenses shall be limited to the costs of equipment (replaced less depreciation) and associated technical and engineering costs. this says "shall make payments." it does  say "may make payments." it says "shall." in way do subsections (c) and (b) take away from the strength of this entitlement. subsection (c) merely points out that "the board for international broadcasting shall issue regulations and establish procedures for carrying out this section ** 0." this does  suggest that the board has any disgretion whether or  to make payments. only that it shall decide how to carry out this mandate. sub. section (d) only sets out how much shall be available to carry out this obligation of the united states during fiscal year 1985. it does  in any way erode the force of subsection (b) which establishes an entitlement for broadcasters harmed by interference. therefore. i urge my colleague to send this resolution back to the budget committee so that they can reconsider this apparent violation of the budget act.
ial commission to fashion a bipartisan approach to dealing with the deficit.. i say to you today: we already have just such a bipartisan approach. it is called the fiscal year 1984 budget resolution. which was the result of weeks of back and forth between members of congress of both parties. its broad outlines are identical to the budget proposed by senators chafee. hatfield. mathias. stafford. and myself. and. along with senator andrews and other of our colleagues. we are committed to seeing this thing through. the finance committee needs a lot of moral support for the tough task of raising taxes. members of congress do  enjoy raising taxes anymore than constituents enjoy paying them. but the alternatives are so frightening that action by finance and by congress as a whole is a must. we say to finance: give us something to work with. and to our colleagues: let us roll up our sleeves. get to work and fulfill our reconciliation responsibilities. we are in danger. in this country. of allowing the nation of repreaentative government to languish in favor of government by commission. if that is the case. then the relevant point is  that the budget resolution is a dead cat. as one of my colleagues put it. but that the congress of the united states is a dead institution.
madam president. i thank my good friend and colleague and ranking member. senator pmire. hing that is before us today would have been possible without his help. he. likewise. comes from a tradition of understanding and compassion for all the elements of this particular appropriation. from education. to science. to various social problems. certainly. lic has always been a watchdog of the treasury. there is question about that. but he combines that fiscal responsibility with a conscience excelled by few. i thank him very much for having brought uts to this point. madam president. before making the usual motion to adopt the committee amendments. i am informed there is a printing error in connection with the amount on page 24. line 4. 1 ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be modified to correctly show that the committee deleted $62.744.000 as provided by the house and inserted in lieu thereof $67.744.000.
it is our understanding. from the department of educations general counsel. that this language is needed to unfreeze the appropriately $50 million in fiscal year 1983. and an undetermined amount in fiscal year 1984. that a chicago federal judge has frozen in order to satisfy the federal obligation in the desegregation case. u.s. against the board of education of the city of chicago. the continuing resolution includes a provision which appropriates $20 million forthis purpose from uligated guaranteed student loan funds. my concern in offering this amendment is for those education programs which are being denied funding because their funds have been frozen pending the outcome of this case. such programs affected are: follow through. womens educational equity. civil rights training. aid to the virgin islands and territories and the secretarys discretionary fund. according to the department. these frozen funds would remain available beyond fiscal year 1983 by virtue of their being held over by the judge. if additional funds are required to satisfy this case beyond the $20 million available. we will certainly do whatever we can to provide these funds at the. appropriate time.
. i appreciate the concerns of the senator in this area. again. i have to repeat that the appropriation is $425 million for fiscal year 1984. and the carryover was $68 million. and we will have a 1984 program level of $493 million. this is well above the appropriation for fiscal 1983. i hope it would meet with the approval of the distinguished senator from rhode island.
but the fact is that we are standing on the threshold of achieving legislation whereby the senate of the united states is a full partner and an independent partner in setting the funding priorities of this nation. that must have some sort of a dollar value. also. i have talked with my friends in education as they have tried to persuade me to support this amendment and indeed they have been good to me. both in terms of their advice with respect to my legislative duties and in terms of their political support. but i asked them the same question about whether or  the time has come for us to be in a position where we can exaine the needs of our times and act upon them. or whether or  we can meet the needs of our times with legislation that is 5 years old. . i will make a point of order that the pending amendment is in violation of rule xvi. paragraph 1. in that it increases appropriations already contained in the bill which does  carry out the provisions of any existing law. treaty. resolution passed by the senate this session or budget estimate. i repeat i do  in any way want to cut off additional comments by my friends but as soon as that comment is forthcoming i would appreciate it if we could get on with the many other priorities that are contained in this bill.
. i appreciate the. good faith efforts on the matter beiiig raised before the senate. on the other hand. i have to point out that this matter has  been raised before the full appropriations subcommittee or indeed the subcommittee which has jurisdiction. it is my understanding that the matter was raised before the office of management and budget and the administration. and they indicated negatively toward having this amount on this bill. i am  anxious to get here and subject my colleagues to a rollcall vote which i think would be very unfair in the sense of my demanding from tl .m or asking them for cooperation in trying to get a bill. and have that across. if you will. from the merits as presented by the distinguished senator from missouri. it would be unfair indeed. i think all of us if we can get administration agreement. if it goes through the process. would support what is being asked. there would be question about it. so why get bogged down and make it difficult for the colleagues on both tides of the aisle in the sense of this particular request. so i want to make it clear. as i have on itemsmaybe even set a new trend in the senateyou pretty well k what is coming out of conference and what is staying in the bill. and i will go ahead and take this amendment and i am going to say it publicly. i am plagiarizing my good friend russell long. i have a feeling it is going to get lost between here and the house.
. under the bill. funding for the direct lending activities at sbawith the exception of the mesbic program. and loans for veterans and the handicappedis ellininated. this was done with a great deal of thought and much hard work and consideration. the fact is. that while the direct loan program may be what the sea is best kn for. it has been one of the agencys least effective programs in terms of "bang for the buck." thebusiness of making loans is one that requires considerable manpower and a. ready supply of cashtwo things in short supply in todays ecoy. sba. unfortunately. has neither sufficient personnel or capital to effectively run such a program. in recent years. as the pool of direct loans has decreased. the number of loans and the average size of the loans have also decreased. in fiscal year 1982. the agency made less than half the loans at half the dlollar amount than it made 2 years earlier2.206 loans at a value of $145.5 million. this averages out td about 52 loans per state. at this level. it seems to me ludicrous to tell prospective borrowers that such a program exists and then have so many firms compe ting for so few loans. even those who do get the loans are going to find it does  go very far. the average loan these days is about $50.000. hardly egh to. make any kind of impact in todays ecoy. finally. as tile ecoy has improved recently and interest rates have begun to decline. there is little differential between the cost to a borrower of a direct and a guaranteed loan. direct loans are  being made at 11% percent. this compares to a guaranteed lending rate of 101/2percent (prime) plus a maximum of 21/ percent to 2%4 percent. when interest rates are so comparable. one has to seriously question whether to keep sba in the business of making direct loans. particularly when. if these businesses are to survive. they must begin to establish a track record with a banking institution. and  with the sba. let me quickly mention some of the. other lending activities at the agency addressed in the committees bill. s. 1323 maintains a $250 million authorizations level for the sbas pollution control equipment contract guarantee program. and a $1.4 billion authorization level for its surety bond guarantee program. by udng taxexempt. sbaguaranteed pollution control bonds. sba cool erates with commercial and investmert banks and local and state authorities to make financing available to eligible small businesses for pollution control equipment mandated by environmental regulatory agencies. the surety bond guarantee program is virtually the only program available that provides small business contractors access to bonding. and is vitally needed. aher provision of the bill maintains the eligibility of certain forprofit organizations for assistance under sbas ietaside program for small businesses.  to exceed $100 million for each fiscal year. this action was taken by the committee after we received a report from the sba indiepting that there were complaints from small businesses concerning thle participation of profit sheltered workshops in the program. and that measurable ecoic injury was sustained by small businesses as a result of participation by profits in the program. an amendment. offered by senator dixon. and unanimously adopted by the committee. also provides that sba shall~enter into commitments to guarantee loans. debentures. and other types of financial assistapce in the full amounts provided by lawfaiubject only to the availability of qualified applications. and limitations contained in the appropriations acts. it should be ed. however. that this provision is  intended to require. sea to enter into commitments where the guarantee authorization is  being used because of an absence of applicants. or where the applicants do  meet the threshold eligibility requirements for such guarantees as provided for in the law. the salaries and expenses section of the sba budget covers all of the lending activities of the agency. in accordance with the committees desire to shift the emphasis of the agencys overall focus. and to strengthen many of its lending functions. this bill recommends that $265.5 million be au* thorized for the salaries and expenses portion of the sea budget for fiscal year 1984. the committee assumes that $15 million budgeted for business development expense will be accounted for under the business loan and investment fund. rather than salaries and expenses account. as suggested by the administration. therefore. the committees recommendation is $23.4 million over the administrations salary and expense request in fiscal year 1984. under salaries and expenses. the committee provides an additional $1.8 million for the office of veterans affairs. over and above the approximately $1.5 million remaining from the inital $3 million appropriated in public law 97276 jo establish the office. this sum will be used to cover personnel and administrative costs. as well as to assist the agency in meeting its mandate of giving "special considera. tion" to veteians in the delivery of its assistance programs. also. $500.000 is specifically earmarked for the office ination. research. and techogy to develop a techogy transfer system at sba. this system will be used to assist small business participation in the small business ination research program. as established in public law 97219. a million dollars was appropriated for the development of this program in fiscal year 1983. and this $500.000 will help to continue the progress that has already begun. in fiscal year 1984. the administration requested funding for 3.910 permanent position at sea. as well as an additional 425 temporary position. as of 1982. sbas loan portfolio was $17.9 billion. with 476.022 loans requiring service. it is the committees feeling the congress should recognize the enlormous growth in this portfolio. and allocate. on a permanent basis. the appropriate number of people to handle a fund of this size. accordingly. $15 million is added to the administrations budget request to allow for additional permanent staff needed to accommodate the increased demand expected to result from the guarantee levels recommended in this bill. mr. presdent. that is the summary of the committees authorization request. i think it is fair. i think it is reasonable. and i think it is realistic. most importantly. i think it addresses. in a very constructive way. the programs facing the sab and the small business community in this ecoty. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation.e
. the labor. health and human services education appropriations conference adopted the senate position on funding for the vocational rehabilitation act. it was and remains the intent of the senate that of the $37.600.000appropriated for service projects at least $650.000 continue to be available to the navaho nationas it was in fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 for a vocational rehabilitation grant. the special circumstances of disabled navahos living on reservations require this continuing federal commitment and it is expected that the funds awarded in this grant in fiscal year 1984 be increased at least to account for inflation since the initial grant award in fiscal year 1982. also as the report of the conferees states. $500.000 of the $37.600.000 appropriated for service projects is to be made available under a cooperative agreement for construction of the garden park enterprises rehabilitation center in phoenix. ariz. prompt construction of this facility will substantially enhance the availability of rehabilitation services in the phoenix area.*
on the matter of lowincome energy assistance. which is of just as great concern to me and to connecticut as anybody in this chamber. in the course of my negotiations with the administration on the laborhealth and human services bill which we passed. i had $193 million in my presentation. budget director stockman suggested that we remove that in the sense that the moneys would be available by virtue of the exxon case. it is clear that those moneys are  immediately available. therefore. i had passed in the committee the addition of $193 million to this bill. after we did that. i received a call from the budget director sayingand that was the nature of the background of the letter read by the distinguished senator from alaskathat either by virtue of surplus moneys or a supplemental the moneys would be available. that we are going to do quarter by quarter. that is fair egh in terms of flexibility to get this continuing resolution passed. if we see any problems. then the money will be allocated. but i want to assure everyone of my colleagues on this floor that i will hold myself personally accountable to see that every state is funded at last years level of effort. that was what i envisaged in my original negotiations on luborhhs. in the meeting of the subcommittee. and in the subsequent discussions witn the budget director. that is my response.  one penny short of thatin other words.  one penny short of what ti.- committee did would be acceptable to this senator as we progress with the dispensing of these moneys.
. the amendment i am offering would simply strike the 1984 authorization in this bill. under current law congress may aulthorize and appropriate such sums as are necessary for carrying out the provisions and purposes of the sbdc program. because the bill as currently drafted places a $25 million cap on the program for fiscal year 1984. even though this is a limitation on the program authorization. without a budget waiver resolution. it would constitute a technical violation of section 402 of thle congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974. accordingly. since a 1984 authorization is  necessary. and to insurc expeditious consideration of this bill. thisamendment is being offered. and i ask that it be adopted.
 reagan has proposed some very modest reductions in the defense budget over the next several years. those. however. will  go far toward resolving the root problem. instead of forcing the military to set priorities and to terminate all marginal programs. the proposed cuts will be accommodated within the budget in the usual fashionby stretching out weapons acquisition programs and by cutting combat readiness and force strueture. the approach is wasteful and irresponsible. some may doubt the political feaslbility of my proposal. but surely the people of this country will  long tolerate pentagon buying sprees at the expense of excellence in education. affordable housing. and an ecoy able to compete on world markets. national security is  just a defense budget. it is the sum total of many factors. including quality of life and quality of political leadership. and if we in the congress are to exercise this sort of leadership over defense spending. then the department of defense must be forced to develop an affordable military strategy.
. my preference would be to place the entire increase in excise taxes cr beer and wine in order to restore at least some equity to the taxation of alcoholic beverages. unfor-. tunately. we do  have the votes to accomplish this objective. therefore. i will support any effort to relieve the federal tax burden imposed on the distilled spirits industry. specifically. i enthusiastically support the ford amendment and urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any further distortion in the taxation of alcoholic beverages.*
. i rise in support of final passage of the flnance committee amendment to s. 2163. at this point in our nations history. we must make every effort to reduce the deficit and after all. that is the primary objective of this amendinent. i do. however have two major concerns about the amendment as adopted and would like to share them with my colleagues prior to the conference on this bill.
. the amendment being offered by the senator from new mexico was contained in the senates version of the dod fiscal year authorization bill which passed the senate on june 21. we have objection to its being added to 8. 2489.
. i am prepared to accept the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina. i think the university of th carolina has done especially good work with respect to its association with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. if there is a part of the budget that needs more funding. it is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.
. i again want to emphasize that since the conference report of the 1984 appropriations bill has already approved these higher program levels. additional appropriations are needed or sought.  does the budget committee oppose this action. these higher program levels are consistent with the action taken by the senate in passing s. 1323. and unless the senate acts quickly to adopt this measure valuable assistance to these programs will either be shut off or seriously curtailed. i urge my colleagues to adopt this important measure which will require additional appropriations.
. i am offering this amendment simply to delete a controversial provision of h.r. 6013 which. given the opposition of the senate finance committee and the administration. would seriously delay and prevent any action on this bill. it is urgent. in my judgment. that the senate act quickly to resolve the serious funding problems for the other programs covered by section 1 of h.r. 6013. particularly the sba handicapped loan program which currently has more funds available for loans to the handicapped through the end of this fiscal year unless this bill is passed. therefore. i am reluctantly offering this amendment to delete section 2 of h.r. 6013. the pollution control tax exempt financing provision of this bill. in anticipation that my colleagues will agree to the urgency of immediately implementing the other provisions of this bill which are consistent with 1984 appropriations. i urge the adoption of this amendment. and after its adoption. will urge the immediate adoption of the remaining provisions in h.r. 6013.
. i thank my distinguished colleague from wisconsin for his overly generous remarks. and only want to point out that two parties are responsible for getting this legislation out of the subcommittee and through the committee. that task in terms of leadership. as far as the democrats are concerned. has been on the shoulders of senator proxmire. indeed. both from the point of view of being a fiscal watchdog and again having the compassion to address the needs of this nation. the decomeratic party could have e better than the distin. guished senator from wisconsin.
the senate version of the bill maintains current funding levels of $740 million and $20 million for employment service and targeted jobs tax credit activities. respectively. which are the amounts requested in the presidents budget. nevertheless. i will keep an open mind when we go to conference. with respect to the house increases for these programs. i would certainly  want to see states forced to close any more employment service offices. plague
s budget request to offset inflation. in addition. the senate bill adds $80.400.000 over the budget request for head start. some of which could be used for indian and migrant projects. but it is  specifically earmarked.
the issues the senator has raised are indeed important. and we will consider raising these issues in the fiscal year 1986 budget hearings. although the mounting indirect costs of federal research are a legitimate matter of concern. we must certainly be careful that while addressing that concern colleges and universities are  discouraged from contributing their own resources to the direct costs of research. . i think we are ready to vote unless other senators have other amendments. i move the adoption of the amendment.
. i believe we have fashioned a bill that is both compassionate for the millions of americans that it serves. and fiscally responsible. our recommendations. while retaining the bulk of the new initiatives of priority concern to congress. is still within the budget resolution ceiling for subcommittee discretionary programs. i therefore urge my colleagues to adopt these conference report recommendations.
. i would like to annce that the senate small buiness committee will hold a field hearing on march 4. 1985. on the impact of tax reform and sirimplification proposals. the hearing will begin at 10 a.m. in the ceremonial courtroom. room 2525 &f the dirksen federal build.ng. chicago. il. senator dixon wili ch.. the hearing. for further information. please contact stewart hudson 3f the committee staff at 224c840.
 of capital southwest venture corp.. dallas. tx. used hard facts and figures to kk the wind out of budget director david stockmans assertion that the sba doles out "subsidized credit." mr. thomas pointed out thkt: theres subsidy in the sbic program. when sbics borrow from the federal financing bank. through an sba guaranty. they pay more than the cost .of money to the treasury..for the past 17 months. operating sbics and those applying for licenses have paid sufficient fees to cover most of the costs of operating the investment arm of sba. and for the past 2 months. sbics have paid a user fee when they borrow. we estimate that this new user fee will bring in more than $2 million each year. thus. just by paying these fees. sbics offset all the costs of the program. without taking into consideration taxes paid by sbics themselves. their partners or shareholders. and the increased taxes paid by sbic portfolio companies and their employees. it should be ed here that sba borrowers can only obtain marketrate. collateral secured loans. contrary to what some mistakenly believe. theres such thing as a free lunch at the sba. mr. thomas further countered ombs claims with these comments: mr. stockman implied in his statement last week that we do  need sbics  that a large venture capital industry exists. i reject that conclusion for five reasons. 01) sbics still accourt for more than -20 percent of the resources of the total venture capital universe and the loss of the more than $2billion committed to sbics would be an emous blow to us. small businesses. (2) in common with every other sbic and venture capital manager. i k that the entire venture capital industry can finance all the qualified investment opportunities we seeits  a case of too many dollars chasing too few good deals. (3) most sbics invest in situations which are  feasible for other venture capital firms. by using leverage. sbics can make an acceptable return on their invested capital by providing funding to entrepreneurs in traditional industries. for that reason. sbics are able to assist a much wider range of businesses that the firms in other segments of the venture capital industry . . . (4) the sbic industry has a far greater geographical dispersion that the rest of the industry. there are licensees in 46 states. small business benefits from this broad distribution of sbics. (5) the highly cyclical nature of the sbic segment of the venture capital industry could mean that venture capital dollars would be available if there were sbics.
there will be those who argue that the impact of this tax will be unevenly distributed among income groups and that it may cause an upturn in the consumer price index. however. there is little doubt that the impact of huge deficit. and inevitable energy crisis. will pose far greater problem. currently. we enjoy plentiful supplies and lower prices for oil. ten years from . however. it is estimated that domestic oil production will have dropped sharply and net imports will have doubled. we will be back where we were 12 years agovulnerable to opec and scrambling for bandaid solutions. motor fuels account for over 60 percent of all petroleum consumed in the united states. it has been estimated that more fuelefficient cars and trucks could cut our need for oil imports in half by the year 2000. at a time of declining prices. this is an opportunity to be seized. any further drop in oil demand would likely stimulate even greater price declines therefore. a gas tax. i effect. pays for itself. instead of returning to the gas guzzling attitudes of pre1973. we should recall the miles of gas lines and the extortionary prices and  allow a repetition of history. a 30centrpergallon tax on gasoline will reestablish a gas conservation ethic. because gas prices are  about 20 cents less than at their peak in 1981. the ecoic impact of this tax will be minimized. furthermore. the ecoist estimates a very modest onehalf percent increase in the consumer price index over 3 years as a result of this tax. i believe this is a small. price tb pay to- avoid opec blackmail. the other great advantage of this tax is what it can do to resolve the budget deficit. the deficit has trebled since 1979. and again this year. we have an administration budget request that calls for major defense increases and the drastic reduction of programs supported by congress and the majority of american people. our children can afford the continued use of our national credit card. we can sacrifice education. healthcare systems. scientific research. the poor. the handicapped and the elderly in order to pay for the defense budget. more revenues are needed both to reduce the deficit and to continue our investments in humanity. my proposal directs the revenues generated by this new tax to meet these two needs. unlike previous gas taxes which direct revenues only to the highway trust fund. this bill provides that half of the revenue would go into the general fund to build americas future. the other half of the revenues will be deposited in the new "public debt repayment trust fund" which is established in this legislation. the moneys in this fund may  be spent except to pay interest on the national debt or to pay off bonds. used to finance the debt. as they come due. with such a fund. we can be assured that these new revenues will be used to offset the deficit and  be used to increase spending in any manner. let this generation get on with it. it is time we added to the well from which we have been drawing at whim and at will for years. . i ask unanimous consent that the bill i am introducing be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that the select committee on intelligence be authorized to meet during the session of the senate. on tuesday. march 26. 1985. in closed session. to conduct a hearing on the fiscal year 1986. intelligence budget.
. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on foreign relations be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on tuesday. march 26. 1985. to mark up the fiscal year 1986 foreign assistance budget.
. during committee consideration of s. 408. the committee adopted two amendments making certain programmatic changes in sbas loan guarantee program. the proposals included an increase in the borrowers fee in the 7(a) guaranteed lending program from 1 to 2 percent for loans which exceed 1 year. and a reduction from 90 percent to 80 percent of the maximum sba guaranteed portion of these loans. these changes resulted in budget authority and outlay savings in sbas business loan and investment fund. s. 408. as reported. failed to reduce the authorization levels to reflect these savings. when the senate considers s. 408. i intend to offer technical and conforming amendments to reflect the committee actions of march 26. 1985. specifically. the amendment would reduce the budget authority in the business loan and investment fund as follows: (in millions of dollars] fiscal year. 1986 ....................................................... 322 1987....................................................... 343 1988 ....................................................... 346 i have asked the congressional budget office to reestimate s. 408 with the inclusion of these technical amendments. furthermore. cbo has recalculated the savings derived from reducing the maximum guarantee fee and made a mi accounting error in their cost estimate printed in the committees report. with the inclusion of these technical amendments and cbos recalculations. the total savings achieved by s. 408 over a 3year period would be $14 million lower in budget authority and $14 million lower in outlays. than previously reported. the total savings achieved by s. 408. with the technical amendment. is $1.1 billion in budget authority and $851 million in outlays over the next 3 fiscal years.
the senate does its business and the house does its business. let us get back to the other points the senator made. first of all. i do . in the course of the deliberations of the committee..say that we do such and such. and because we do such and such we will do such and such. each matter has to stand on its own feet. the distinguished senator from idaho raised a point which was considered and passed upon by the committee. if we are going to have equivalence here. his committee amendment calls for $3.8 million a year. a 30year program that we are talking about. as compared to the $30 million being requested by the distinguished senator from ohio for the balance of the current fiscal year. i can put the situation in any clearer fashion than indicated by my friend from oregon that it could very well be that matters will work work out in conference. i might add that the amendment of the distinguished senator from idaho is also subject to that same conference. one is giving him any guarantees as to what is going to happen. if indeed we are to have a vote on the matter. fine. let us have an upordown vote on it. i have to oppose it on the basis that this has been carefully constructed by the committee. that the matter is  foreclosed. that it can be negotiated and probably would be negotiated within the conference committee. it is  up to me to go ahead and indicate what it is the distinguished senator from ohio is going to do or  do. but please. let us understand what the committee did. the committee fully understood what it was doing insofar as this matter was concerned. it had relationship to senator mcclures amendment  any other proposal. whether it be senator chiles or whatever. it was on its own feet. as such. it was considered that since the matter is already in conference. we will face that issue when we get into conference. i. would hope that is where it goes. it seems the senator from ohio has raised a valid point. let us try to work this thing out in a manner that will benefit those states that the senator. i think properly. indicates need some assistance.
the senator from washington is correct. the committee is aware of the problems raised by orrs interpretation of the fiscal year 1985 continuing resolution as it pertains to funding for targeted assistance. the committee has therefore directed the comptroller general to review the matter and report to the committee within 30 days as to the legality of orrs action and whether such action will result in a reduction in current services for fiscal year 1985. 0
i agree with the senators from washington that orrs action will have a severe impact on the 33 targeted assistance areas around the country if the existing controversy is  resolved. thus. after the comptroller general has completed the analysis we have requested and if orr does  make available the full amount congress intended in fiscal year 1985 for targeted assistance i will certainly consider language in the next general appropriations bill for labor/hhs education and related agencies.
. i am pleased to report that yesterday the senate passed s. 990. the national oceanic and atmospheric administration act. this legislation authorizes appropriations for general program support and certain ocean and coastal activities of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration [a] for fiscal years 1986 and 1987. these activities include ocean pollution planning. ocean and ocean dumping research. marine. ocean. and aircraft services. and mapping. charting. and geodesy programs. the bill imposes a freeze on spending for these programs. capping the fiscal year 1986 authorization level at the 1985 appropriations mark. and allowing a 4.5percent increase for fiscal year 1987. this action reflects the budget package passed earlier this year by the senate. reauthorizations for three acts relevant to as mission are also included. as land resources become scarce. we are looking to the sea to help us meet the growing needs of our ecoy. recent scientific and techogical advances have repidly expanded our use of the oceans to encompass such diverse activities as oil and gas deepsea exploration and development. exploration and research with deepsea submersible vessels. and fisheries and aquaculture reseasrch and development. developing sound policies to deal with these diverse uses has been one of my highest priorities as a member of the senate. as the federal agency with the primary responsibility for the nations research. service. and regulatory programs affecting ocean and coastal activities. a has played a key role in the development of these policies. in the past few years. the federal budget has come under increased pressure. this pressure has been felt most acutely by the nations oceans and coastal programs. as a member of the senate appropriations subcommittee on commerce. justice. state. and the judiciary. i have been particularly aware of the impact of such budget stringencies on environmental research. these circumstances have resulted in difficult choices for congress. yet i feel very strongly that as activities should be a top priority in order to efficiently develop and conserve our ocean and coastal resources. with the passage of s. 990. we can continue to maintain sound ocean and coastal research programs within a.o
i thank the chair. ial sponsorship of tax reform. believe me. i think it fair to point a very accurate finger at the democratic leadership of the house. that is totally misleading the american people as to how we get out of this problem. i urge that they get down to brass tacks with my friend. senator domenici. and report out a budget that will reduce the deficit. that means everybody is going to have to participateold and young and everybody in between. so those are the origins of what we have before us.  1. it fails on the account of what it will accomplish in terms of the deficit. . at least to me of equal importance. and. in some ways. of far greater importance. is what this legislation does to our constitution. to the protection that we all have afforded us by three separate but equal branches of government.
. he keeps going around talking about these balancethebudget constitutional amendments and line item vetoes. it is his deficit as much as anyone elses. sure he inherited a portion of it. but he sure has added on to it. if he wants to balance the budget. let him present a balanced budget to the congress for our consideration. if senators mattingly. evans.
is there any reason why we can vote on the debt limit today. a clean debt limit. i just propose that to the majority leader. i do  understand why we have merged two subjects. we could vote on the debt limit on monday. without getting into these other matters.
. this bill does most assuredly  meet the full human service needs of our citizens. important education. health and job training programsmany of them already unable to meet peoples demands for helpwill suffer further by having to absorb inflationary cost increases. yet in this time when so many say that deficits are to be corrected by slashing only human service programs. we can at least take heart that in h.r. 3424 we have  closed our eyes and ears to human need. i urge my colleagues to recognize h.r. 3424 for what it isa very delicate balance between human needs and fiscal responsibility. it is a balance born from oyer 30 days of hearings by the laborhhseducation subcommittee. it is a balance which can be easily upset should we  tilt in one direction or aher by iging the reality of the budget resolution or by blindly slashing at real services to needy people. i urge that we maintain the balance and vote approval of h.r. 3424. there is one additional comment i would like to make. what is in this bill is here by virtue of the input. i would say. of close to 100 u.s. senators. during both the subcommittee hearings and the full committee hearings and prior to our appearance on the floor. the committee has tried to pay close attention to the priorities set forth by individual members and the body as well. as i come to this floor this morning. we are about $20 million under theoutlay figure. and if anybody wants to go ahead and bust this bill. they can do so once we get over that figure. i have to point out. however. when that happens. then all the very carefully crafted compromises and inclusions go out the window. so i hope we could accomplish the passage of the bill in short order. i understand there are some issues on what i would call the social agenda that need some ironing out. and i am willing to address those matters. but. otherwise. i hope we can move to rapid consideration of the bill. king that it is a result of hard work on the part of the committee and hard bargaining within the republican leadership itself. and certainly there is more difficult work ahead in conference with the house
i would only like tially restore the cuts which would a the record to show. howeverand i have taken place last summer. that bostmm . want to emphasize the point raised by amendment was adopted by pnrog the distinguished senator from wis- mous consent and accepted by the cag consini want to make it clear this is house of representatives. although elner. detroit.  a continuing obligation insofar as some cities did  receive funding hartford this committee or the u.s. senate is until after their programs began. homi olnconcerned. this is a sum of money re- funds were eventually utilized. in view level. 8 quired in pursuit of the objectives of the success of this summer employ- d.wook. stated by the senator from illis for ment project. there is justification nashville fiscal year 1986. and that is it. for cutting it. .newarka
i understand. believe me i also have tried as best as my ingenuity can serve me to meet the dictates of the budget committee with all the fiscal piety that goes with those dictates. i understand we are talking about a $16 million road project in new mexico. we already have $16 million in unexpended funds which are to be used. is that correct.
what the senator is doing is what we all had to do on the committee: go back to these unexpended funds. if you will. and use them so we could cut down the budget authority and the outlays in our committee. is that what the senator did.
i think in terms of the integrity of the budget process really what we should have is an up and down vote.  a motion. very frankly.  a point of order. i think we should have an up and down vote on this project. and i might add at this time i. ask for the yeas and nays -on the amendment. -
. let us find out whether even the budgeteers are serious about this process or whether it is a piocess that applies to everyone here and the various committees except for those in situations that occur within their own states. again i suppose what bothers me is  so much the project but the fact that there is money for this project in this budget and that money was gotten the same way we have to scrounge and get money for far more worthwhile projects throughout the list existing in various committees which we chair. i do  k what the chairman intends to do. i hope we have an upanddown vote. i hope there is tabling motion on this but that we go ahead and defeat the amendment of the senator from new mexico.
i agree with the statement of the senator from idaho visavis the change in numbers. let me say. prefatory to my remarks to him. that i wish to reiterate what the senator from th dakota.said. that one here in any manner. shape. or form has ..any personal ax to grind with the senator from new mexico or the budget committee. but we are talking about a process. - . to the senator from idaho. does the senator from idaho recall that at the appropriations committee hearing. when we were trying to allocate these various figures. committeeafter committee came in with revised numbers that were based on administration figures.
the budget committee. or more particularly.  the budget committee. but senator domenici at that meeting of the appropriations committee. said. "look. there has to be a cutoff point." which is fair egh. when you devise any sort of budget. there has to be a cutoff point lotherwise everyone comes .in with new figures. which might be perfectly correct. . what we are running into here is the very point made by the senator from new mexico at that allocation hearing. there. had to be a cutoff point. that is the point at which the senator from new mexico had to work with his budget committee and the senator from th dakota had to work with his appropriations subcommittee. that was the rule set at that allocation meeting. . what we are saying is. "but. nevertheless.  we have -some further information on this one point." but we had further information on a lot of other- points. but we used one cutoff date. so i recognize the absolute validity of what has been said. i do  contest what the department of transportation is saying. but we all agreed on that conunittee that there was to be one point. that point was determined. and  i think that rule should be applied to the senator from new mexico. as well.
. in order to focus on the issue before the senate and to make certain that in wise is this determined on the basis of personality. i would be willing to go ahead and withdraw my request for the yeas and nays if indeed the chairman of the budget committee would give the assurance on this floor that from  on the figures used in the budgetappropriations process will be the latest figures that we have at hand. this is what the senator from idaho was referring to. that we should  act on something that is out of date. i could  agree more. that is foolishness. it was foolishness when the appropriations committee met because there were many figures both in senator andrews subcommittee and mine that were. by evidenced fact. statements of various agencies. out of date. we were told. "sorry.. there is a cutoff date and that is it." that is the same as the statement of the senator from new mexico. if the senator from new mexico will assure us that in this budget process we use some common sense and that we are entitled to use the latest. figures rather than figures set as of a certain date and time by the budget committee. if we have that assurance. i will withdraw my request for the yeas and nays.
that is the issue here. it is  as to whether or  we are going to have more laws and regulations as to this matter of personal conduct. be it in terms of election campaigns or performance on the senate floor. what the american people are deserving of is full disclosure. fair egh. if they are too damn lazy  to vote. and they are doing that in increasing numbers. then they deserve what they get. but you can get good politicians by enacting something into law any more than you can have a balanced budget by enacting a balanced budget constitutional amendment. if you want to balance the budget. balance it. do  write something into the constitution. if you want good public officials. then go ahead and decide what -their record is and from whence comes their assistance and make those decisions. then. go ahead and hustle your tail out there and either throw them out of office or make sure you keep good people in. but mechanism devised here on the senate floor is going to protect us from the unscrupulous. for that reason. i suggest that the next time we come forth with a reform it be in a matter of total strict disclosure and  the legislation proposed by the senator from oklahoma. i applaud my colleagues motives in attempting to make elective office more accessible to all in this nation. but despite these worthy motives. the amendment before us is flawed. it offers a change in current law. but what it does  offer is real reform. unfortunately. this amendment is an independent expenditure proliferation amendment. on the one hand. . the amendment of the senator from oklahoma attempts reform by strictly limiting political action committees in their effort to support candidate committees and parties. at the same time. it encourages. indeed it requires. pacs to move further outside the political parties and established channels of political communication to get their message across. it also encourages pacs to grow. to collect and spend ever larger aggregate amounts of cash in order to fill candidate coffers quickly before the dollar limits envisioned by this amendment are reached. as others of my colleagues have ed. the changes in election law proposed by this amendment have  yet been aired in any congressional hearing. furthermore. it comes to us here. on the floor of the u.s. senate. under an agreement that limits both. the time of debate and the type of amendments that can be offered. clearly. there has been inadequate discussion of this amendment. anytime this body moves to require mandatory free broadcasts on behalf of political candidates. as this amendment requires. respect and defense of the first amendment demands we consider the proposal longer than 4 hours. i respect the intentions of those who feel as i do that major political races in this nation are taking place only after qualifying heats have quietly determined the winners in the race for cash and credit. one in this body.  even the senator from oklahoma or his cosponsors of this amendment. would say that this proposal would suddenly remove any significant amount of special interest money from american politics. insteadand i k this is  the intention of my friend from oklahomawe have here a lawyers protection amendment. it attempts to reform political campaigns by narrowing the participation of pacs in some areas and widening it in others andas i see itthe only clear beneficiaries are the attorneys who will be paid to get around the restrictions. i do  believe broad new regulations are necessary. redirecting campaign money does hing to further empower the american people. and further empowering the american people is finally the only good reason for reform. the essential power of individuals in the electoral process is of course. the vote. a vote furthermore that is cast by individuals exposed to tllc7lwidest range of information. an important part of this information deals with the sources of money in a campaign. full disclosure of this information puts the tools of campaign reform where they belong. in the hands of the voters. it is the voters who must decide if the performance of their political leaders is tied to special interest money. if it is bribery we are talking about. let us encourage indictments. but if it is . if it is the gray area of influence or access. then the voters can best judge their leaders. even if it means judging the politicians by the cash they keep. i remain a supporter of any proposal that furthers voluntary participation in the political process. the key to this participation remains the same as it did in the crises of the early 1970s. information. the product of mandatory disclosure. on the other hand. shuffling campaign money around the political landscape at the last minute for the sake of a socalled reform is a bad way to legislate matter how well it plays at home
i thank my good friend from pennsylvania for sharing this information with us. he is correct in saying that the house and senate appropriations committees included report language accompanying h.r. 3424 providing for the continued funding of the 11 longtermcare gerontology centers that were in existence in fiscal year 1985. the conferees insisted upon this language in order to make absolutely clear to the administration on aging our strong bipartisan support for these centers and our desire that it continue to fund them at the fiscal 1985 funding levels.
that is precisely what the language means. the administration is to expend the entire $50 million in new budget authority during fiscal year 1986 in addition to the fiscal year 1985 $11.5 million recently distributed to the states in compliance with the federal district and appellate court orders.
. by way of assuring my good friend from new york  all republicans do take responsibility for the matter before us. i raise a point of order that section 252(a)(2) relating to special. sequestration procedures for national defense for fiscal year 1986 contained in this conference report violates rule 282 of the standing rules of the senate.
. our work can be done by default. we must be inative and courageous. we need to set certain priorities as we have for fiscal 1986 in the reconciliation bill and stick to them. then we will once again be fulfilling the responsibilities of the legislative branch of government and the american people will applaud our efforts.9
.. 25 to elect a senator. or 20 percent a congressman. do we believe the majority of illis democratic primary voters meant to choose two rightwing extremists as candidates for lieutenant gover and secretary of state as they did 2 weeks ago. it really doesnt matter what the 21 percent of eligible voters who actually voted meant to do. what matters is the 79 percent who failed to even show up. e of us dare say with certainty in any part of the nation that it cant happen in a general election or that it cant happen anywhere in the nation. the greatest danger in this sort of apathy is  the elevation of extremism.  the threat that the worst can occur. bu rather the promise that the best can. in this context. the balanced budget amendment is an incentive to mediocrity. a reward for the spectators.  the players. it promises a future that will  be the result of choice. but rather the product of default. let useach of usmake an admission and call off this assault on the constitution. the inability we have shown in dealing with the realities of the budget is the fault of constitutional officers who are responsible for choices never made or politically off limits. to say it is the fault of the constitution is to mislead the american people. next year we celebrate the: 200th anniversary of the constitution. in 1887. during the celebration of the constitutions first 100 years. british leader william gladstone wrote. "i have always regarded that constitution as the most remarkable work kn to me in modem times to have: been produced by the human intellect. at a single stroke. in its application to political affairs." in the midst of our current "political affairs." i would ask my colleagues to reflect on this anniversary. and i would ask that we stand together and refuse. to have this "remarkable work" of the founding fathers marred by the inclusion of this manifesto of political failure called the: balanced budget amendment.
. what this finally boils down to is that the advocacy of education does  rest with the secretary of education. except. perhaps for his advocacy of bilingual education. advocacy of education is  up to the budget committee. it is this body that has to speak to the advocacy of education as a matter of national priority. that is what is at issue here.  the budget committee.  the secretary of education. but each individual senator saying. yes. in the course of the overall budget. education  deserves an emphasis which has been lacking over the past several years.
specifically. the committees resolution assumes the continuation of sba direct loans for miities. veterans and the handicapped at the fiscal year 1986 level. as adjusted by the march 1 sequester order. or $97 million. that the section 503 development company program starting in fiscal year 1988 would be completely financed through the private capital markets rather than through the federal financing bank [ffb]. that the guaranteed loan programs would be continued at the cbo current services levels and the disaster loan program would be maintained for homeowners and businesses. all of these assumptions were recommendations of the small business committee. is that correct.
beyond the small business committee funding recommendations. the resolution assumes a pilot loan sale program to sell $200 million a year of sba business loans for the next 3 fiscal years and that starting in fiscal year 1987 sbas guarantee loan programs would become selfsupporting.
. as senator domenici ks. i strongly object to the committees assumption that starting in fiscal year 1987. the guaranteed loan programs become selfsupporting. under that concept. the committees resolution assumes appropriations for losses would be allowed for guaranteed loans made starting october 1. 1986. and the sbas salaries and expenses would be reduced by 20 percent. both of these assumptions would be devastating to the sba. in my judgment. requiring a selfsupporting guaranteed program in fiscal year 1987 will effectively terminate the 7(a) program. this program was the primary target of former omb director stockmans attack on sba. maintaining the 7(a) program. which is an important source of longterm capital for small businesses. was an integral part of our 3year agreement. last year. my committee explored ways to reduce costs of the 7(a) program. doubling the fee to the borrower. from 1 to 2 percent. and reducing the maximum federal guarantee to 85 percent for loans over $155.000 were the results of last years work which are  law pursuant to public law 99272. to make the program selfsupporting immediately would require increasing the borrowers fee to more than five points and reducing the guarantee below 70 percent. such changes would fundamentally alter the purpose of the program. before making additional changes. we should wait to evaluate the impact of the reforms just enacted. this position is further buttressed by letters the chairman of the budget committee and i have received from the american bankers association. government guaranteed lenders association. the money store. and merrill lynch. i ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed at this point in the record.
. i propose to meet the committees reconciliation instruction by requiring all 503 development company loans to be sold in the private capital markets effective october 1. 1986. by charging an additional onequarter of a point bank servicing fee on the outstanding balance of 7(a) guaranteed loans and by agreeing to test the budget committees pilot sale of sba loans. in order to meet our instruction. the committee would sell $660 million of loans over 3 years rather than the $600 mil.icn loans assumed by the budget comnttee. it is my understanding that according to cbo these changes in law would meet the committees reconciliation instructions.
i thank the senator for those assurances and for his patience and willingness to work with the small business committee. as he ks. the small business committee has been an active participant in this deficit reduction battle. during my chairmanship. we have reduced sbas budget by over 50 percent. in fiscal year 1986. the total agencys budget was approximately $750 million. . sba has taken its budget hits. significant reforms have been instituted. sba has become a lean and effective agency. i hope this fact is recognized in the future when the congress strives to meet its deficit reduction goals as set forth in grammrudmanhollings.
. i rise to commend the chairman and ranking miity member of the budget committee for their work in crafting a budget resolution compromise which incorporates increased fiscal year 1987 funding for education of handicapped children. it is my understanding that the resolution  includes an additional $265 million to fund a new initiative in the area of early childhood intervention services for handicapped children. and to provide for an increased federal. contribution to the state grant program for handicapped education. on april 28. the senate subcommittee on the handicapped unanimously reported s. 2294. the education of the handicapped amendments of 1986. to the full committee on labor and human resources. that legislation asks congress and the administration to accept both in law and fiscal policy what the experts  recognize in fact. that is. that this nation has an opportunity to help lift an entire generation of handicapped children to levels of achievement and independence never before thought possible. through intensive services during the early childhood years. the crucial link between early childhood intervention services. achievement. and ecoic benefit to the disabled and the nation is  widely understood. the department of education. in its 1985 report to congress. said the following. and i quote: studies of the effectiveness of preschool education for the handicapped have demonstrated beyond doubt the ecoic and educational benefits of programs for young handicapped children. in addition. the studies have shown that the earlier intervention is started. the greater is the ultimate dollar savings and the higher is the rate of educational attainment by these handicapped children. therefore. consistent with the clear need for early intervention services and the provisions of s. 2294. this resolution  contains $200 million for early childhood intervention services for handicapped children. further. the resolution also contains $65 million to enable the federal government to begin. in a small but significant way. to make good on its 10year old commitment to education of the handicapped through the basic state grant program. these funds. together with funds already available in the resolution as it was reported by the senate budget committee. will allow the federal share of the handicapped education state grant program to rise to 10 percent. im sure my colleagues remember the enactment of public law 94142. guaranteeing a free. appropriate public education for all handicapped children. that act authorized a gradually increasing federal contribution beginning at 5 percent in fiscal year 1977. and growing to 40 percent by fiscal year 1982. the federal government kept up its commitment during the first 2 years after public law 94142. but beginning in fiscal year 1979. we began to lag farther and farther behind the levels envisioned in the law. in fiscal year 1979. when the law authorized a 20percent share. the federal contribution was 12.5 percent. for the last 4 years. we have hovered around a 9- or 10percent level. while the authorization has been at 40 percent. and under grammrudmanhollings. the fiscal year 1986 appropriation ends up paying for only 8.6 percent. yet my colleagues should k that. if the administration had had its way for fiscal year 1987. the percentage would have dropped below the fiscal year 1986 levels. to about 8 percent. fortunately. the education amendment adopted by the senate earlier in this debate turned aside that request. today. the senate has reaffirmed its commitment to special education. our efforts here on behalf of handicapped children are really of benefit to us all. as compassionate human beings. as taxpayers. and as the parents and friends of all those with disabilities.
madam president. i ask unanimous consent that the committee on governmental affairs be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. may 14. to continue the hearing on s. 2232. federal management reorganization and cost control act of 1986. and s. 2141. the loan accounting reform and deficit reduction act of 1986.
madam president. i ask unanimous consent that the select committee on intelligence be authorized to meet during the session of the senate on wednesday. may 14. in closed session. to mark up the fiscal year 1987. intelligence authorization.
i share senator metzenbaums concern over mshas failure to hire the 90 mine inspectors that congress directed should be added as part of 1986 operations. but this supplemental appropriation is the wrong place to address that concern. moreover. there are barely 4 months left in the current fiscal year. i believe the cause of mine safety and health would be better served by providing that 90 slots for additional mine inspectors be included as part of mshas regular appropriation for fiscal year 1987. i would be willing to work with senator metzenbaum to insure that money is available for these 90 inspector positions in the next fiscal year. and that the msha appropriation makes absolutely clear the agencys obligation to add field inspectors and to use the specified funds for other purpose.
to maintain 785.000 enrollments in the 1987 summer youth program. it appears an additional appropriation of $175 million will be needed. this amount would provide for an enriched educational component as requested by the administration. and can be addressed in the regular fiscal 1987 laborhhseducation appropriations bill.
we have adequate time in which to address both of these problems with the 1987 regular appropriation and i intend to do so. however. the senator from illis should be aware that there may  be sufficient latitude in the budget to address both years in the 1987 appropriation. i would like to assure the senator that we will take care of his concerns in the regular bill. but it may  be possible.
i would like to clarify for the chairman. of the budget committee. my good friend senator domenici. .the: intent of two provisions in s.. 2294. the education of the handicapped. amendments of 1986. with respect.to the. first.provision. on page 30. line 19. the intent of the bill language is to allow the secretary of education to make allotments from sums appropriated to states under subpart 2 of part b of. the act even if appropriations fall below $50.000.000. assuming the states are making good faith efforts to comply with the provisions of this subpart. the language is  intended to imply that states are enti tied to receive allotments beyond any amounts appropriated by congress. with respect to the second provision. the bill language on page 59. lines 1 and 2. the language authorizes the secretary to make grants or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with the national theater for the deaf. again. it is  the intent of the bill to create any form of new contract authority prohibited by the budget act. the authority to enter into contracts is intended to be subject to appropriations.
the senator is correct. i have gone beyond the bounds of a question. but i did ask the question as to whether or  the senator who signed onto this bill agrees that this is first. an exception. and is within the section of title tax shelters.
. i would hope that the housesenate conferees on the tax bill will correct this problem area. the legislation before us is a remarkable achievement. the reduction of individual tax rates is truly historic. however. i am convinced we can achieve these objectives of the bill while maintaining necessary capital formation incentives. martin feldstein. in an article that appeared in the wall street journal on may 19. 1986. labled the senate finance committees bill a "gamble with capital formation." mr. feldstein summarized his concerns: we are about to have a monumental tax reform. it would be a great pity if this historic change in tax rules ended up hurting the captialaccumulation process that is the driving force of ecoic growth and of the international competitiveness of our manufacturing industry.
. i am skeptical of that figure. and i commend my colleagues to revisit the ecoic data which show that. as the feldstelns conclude. the elimination of a differential actually costs the treasury money. the feldsteins article suggests under the optimal revision for the conference committee we should halve the current longterm capital gains exclusion from 60 percent to 30 percent. which combined with the sharply lower personal rates. will keep the tax on capital gains at roughly the same level as under current law. i agree with their conclusion. and ask that the post article be printed in the record.
. on june 30. sherwin montell. director of financial resources for the social security administration. will retire from the federal service. sherwin got off to a good start in 1951 by graduating from wesleyan university in middletown. ct. after serving on active duty in the navy. he signed on as a budget examiner with the national labor relations board. since 1970. sherwin has been working with the laborhhs appropriations subcommittee. which i chair. as budget officer. and since 1979. as director of financial resources for the social security administration. it is a pleasure for me to join with sherwins colleagues in wishing him well in his retirement from federal service.*
. i ask unanimous consent that senate committees have until 12 n wednesday. july 30. 1986 to submit recommendations to the senate budget committee pursuant to section 2 of senate congressional resolution 120.
clearly the importance and the dignity of the issues would seem to point it should have a separate vote on this. and i  refer to the sanctions issue. a separate vote on the floor of the senate. as much as i disagreed with the vote visavis the contras. or whatever you want to call them. that also had its day and it had its vote. i lost. in any event. i believe the issue of south africa deserves a freestanding vote on this floor. i think it is quite obvious to all of us here two things are going to happen. there are those who would delay the south african vote as indeed there are those who would delay the vote on the contra aid. additionally. it might very well occur that all of these issues will be stripped from the debt ceiling bill when it goes to conference. which means that all this time will have been wasted and clear voice would have spoken from the floor of the senate on any of these issues. i would hope that under the auspices of the majority and miity leaders something might be worked out whereupon each one of us would have a chance to express our opinions on these matters by virtue of a vote.  by virture of longwinded speeches. the time is short and the issues are important. i think we ought to be registered to the world as to how we feel in a clearcut way.  as an amendment to the debt ceiling. which risks beingstripped off and then the issues being back here sometime way in the future.  as a tradeoff one for the other. we have these issues before us. it seems to me under the auspices of the majority leader we should be able to sit here and clearly pinpoint a time this week. next week at the latest on these issues. i hope that would happen.
i thank the distinguished majority leader. ial speech and something less than decisive action by the commonwealth. all we have to do is something ineffective on the senate floor and that will be devastating to the hope which they hold insofar as action by the u.s. senate is concerned. one is more passionately against the policy of contra aid than i am. yet i would have to be the first one to state as a matter of fact that the issue has had its day in court. -but just on the simple matter of fairness and equity. south africa is  at the head of the agenda and it deserves its day in court. which it has  yet had. i wish i could say that there was unanimity among those who are against contra aid insofar as what to do with the next piece of legislation coming down the pike. but there is  and those who are against contra aid k that. to link these two and .destroy our opportunity as a nation to send forth a clear message on the issue of apartheidunfortunately for me. and i think many of my colleagues understand that i do  shift my ground very often. but i indicated to the majority leader that in order that this mighti  refer to the south africa sanctionsmove. i would be willing to vote cloture on the contra issue. i am still against it. i will vote against the substance. i did in the appropriations committee today. i deem this issue of south african sanctions to be of sufficient overriding importance that i think accommodation in these few days left is something that has to be a part of the process. and that is what we are here for. this is  a amateur night. these are the finest professionals in a political sense in the united states. and it does  mean you. get your way 100 percent of the time. i fought contra aid and i lost. i am going to fight it again. but right . the fight to be waged relates to south africa and the sanctions and the hope that we can send the blacks of that nation. and to get into a partisan squabble or philosophical squabble or where we deem this to be important and we try to link this to that demeans us as a body and i think betrays the professionalism which is attributed to the 100 members of this body. i do  think there is much the majority leader and i have agreed on in terms of substance on issue. but. yes. i believe his word and i believe he is doing his best to unravel a very kty situation. just so i keep it on my side of the aisle. try to go ahead and resolve a dispute between jesse helms and lowell weicker. try that on for size sometime. never mind as between republicans and democrats. well. that is the job he has. very simply. right here on this issue. and you can compound that with many other senators on both sides of both these issues. one last word. if i might. in the sense of the good senator from massachusetts and myself. two years ago he went to south africa. i went to jail. so i am well aware how our heart is in this issue and what we have tried to do to bring it to pass. and as in any other governmental political current many forces are  moving around us in these last few days of this legislature. but i would ask those of us who share the opinion that senator kennedy and i have visavis the issue of sanctions that we give the leadership. both republican and democratic leaders. the opportunity to work this out so that we can speak clearly on both issues. separately and clearly and  confuse it in some parliamentary muddle which sends message to anybody. i think that can be done. but i think both the miity and the majority leader are going to need the support of all those on every side of this issue and certainly those of us who are considered the most extreme. whatever that means. i say all this because somebody came to me today and indicated that remarks had been made.  i might add from within this body but from without. that the impasse was the fault in the main of the majority leader. that is  the case. as late as 1 hour ago. the majority leader sat in that cloakroom and indicated to me that he would  go ahead and see what he could do and there was mention of any amendment being put up to force his hand. it was strictly a conversation as to how we could get out of this. that he would  see what he could do to get individual days debate on each one of these issues. . there is where we sit and that explains everything as to what has been out on the table and what has been back in the cloakroom. i hope that every member of this body will do everything he can to see that that takes place because i will tell you what is going to happen to an amendment on the debt ceiling. it is  going to become law. and i can tell you what is going to happen to an amendment on the dod authorization. my gosh. they will  even be finished with the conference until october or ember and then all help for the blacks is going to be totally lost. it is going to do us good. so i repeat where i started. the issue is  a vote on sanctions. the issue is a vote on a bill that will become law. become law. and therefore be the statement of the united states of america to combat this inhumanity and indignity and that overrides to me our philosophical and partisan differences.
. to the amendment before us i first want to commend the committee for devising its bill and its solutions to the problem. that committee bill is a long way from the present policy of constructive engagement. a long way. and it stands as a great credit to the foreign relations committee and the senators who participated in the writing and the passage of that bill. and it certainly is a long way from the beginning of the debate on this subject several years ago and protests in front of the south african embassy in washington. i have attempted in this amendment to tighten up in a series of small measures the provisions of that bill. i have worked hard and long. i might add. with the distinguished senator from indiana. as well as the senator from massachusetts. and this amendment embodies the following provisions: first. it redefines south africa to include namibia in the sanctions. namibia. which borders on south africa. is occupied by south africa in violation of international law. the united nations security council. with u.s. support. has called upon all countries to refrain from dealing with south africa insofar as namibia is concerned. the state department is on record discouraging united states investment in namibia. the south africaestablished government there has rescinded some aspects of apartheid. but segregation permeates housing. education. health care. transportation. and employment. second. this amendment then redefines south africa to include namibia in the sanctions. also. it expands landing rights ban to include united states flights to south africa. this is a recommendation of the eminent persons group and one of the sanctions that will be applied by the commonwealth without britain. there are currently flights from the united states to south africa. but this is considered an important symbolic sanction. because the committee language terminates a treaty relating to air travel between the united states and south africa. flights would be allowed between the two countries once this amendment is adopted. any flight originating in south africa must first land in a third country if the destination is the united states. the reverse would also be true under this amendment. the language in here also. i might add. includes the words "controlled by." thus preventing south africans from leasing aircraft or having their aircraft leased for purposes of direct flight to the united states. again. the reverse is true from the united states to south africa. third. terminate dual taxation agreements with south africa. this amendment would terminate treaty entitled "convention between the government of the united states of america and the government of the union of south africa for the avoidance of double taxation and for establishing rules of reciprocal administrative assistance with respect to taxes of income." the treaty currently prohibits double taxation of income of south african and united states nationals. the treaty is an underpinning of tax relations between the united states and approximately 37 nations of the world. it is a statement of international cooperation that upholds a belief that ecoic activity carries with it a political benefit that should be encouraged rather than stifled by tax policy. there is a separate component of u.s. tax policy that provides u.s. nationals a tax credit for taxes paid in other nations. this is a separate matter. the foreign tax credit is an effort to provide a measure of fairness in the u.s. tax code. the treaty with south africa. on the other hand. is a recognition of the benefits of ecoic activity in south africa and it flies in the face of this legislation. fourth. prohibit united states government contracts and procurement with south africa and assistance to trade and tourism.
. i would like to clarify for the chairman of the budget committee. my good friend senator domenici. the intent ol sections 702(e) and 805(b) of the reha. bilitation act amendments of 1986. the intent of the bill language is tc authorize continued assistance ir fiscal year 1987 for grantees receiving assistance in fiscal year 1986 and tc authorize continued assistance for years for qualified grantees. both pro visions of sections 702(e) and 805(b) are subject to subsequent appropriation action and are  intended to create new entitlements.
mr. presiden unanimous consent that the proceed to the consideration 5233. an act making appropriati the departments of labor. hea human services. education. an ed agencies for the fiscal year september 30. 1987. and for oth poses. i further ask unanimous that the committee amendm h.r. 5233 be considered and ag en bloc. providedthat po order under rule xvi are thereon. and that the meas amended be considered as origil for the purpose of further ments with the following exc page 41. lines 6 and 7. page 59. through page 61. line 3.
. we do  need more money allocated anything i could say after the speech to us at the expense of nih. we do of the senator from connecticut. the  need more money allocated to us chairman of the committee. would be at the expense of the retarded. we do certainly anticlimatic and i will be  need more. money allocated to us very brief. at the expense of the elderly. we need i support the senator from conmore money allocated to us coming necticut. i oppose the amendment. i from those aspects of our national life think it is a mistake and in the long which have. all the money and more run it could be a serious mistake. i than anybody can use and. indeed. so would like to make one modest point. much that it is wasted by the barrel- consider the longterm effect of this ful. i have a tin cup for the budget amendment. the ultimate impact of that i represent. i hope the amend- the amendment is to increase federal ment is defeated. spending by adding to the total budget
i say to the distinguished senator i would be willing to accommodate his concerns if there were to be an increase in the allocation for this subcommittee. we are at the limit. this is an activity we would like to support if there were room. i would like to say i k this is  in the prepared colloquy. but the house of representatives. in arriving at its figures. has left out billions of dollars because certain programs which they k are going to be reauthorized have  been reauthorized as of the date of making up their appropriations. but i would say that all of us in this room on a conservative principle certainly have included that money in devising our appropriation. they just left them out. i would like to k what is going to happen when those bills are authorized. so i want to say this. it has been an exercise in the fiscal irresponsibility as devising budgets that are realistic. it makes it doubly hard for me to stand here with the senator from pennsylvania. who has a legitimate request. in fact. the bottom line. raw question he is asking me is how come they have it and we do . all right. i am giving the answer. we have tried to be responsible in devising this budget. on the other hand. if there are moneys there as we arrive at the conference so we can accommodate the senator from pennsylvania. believe me. i will be happy to do so.
the senators summary of the budget problem that confronted the committee is accurate. funding was  eliminated because of a judgment that the program was ineffective and ought to be eliminated. and may i say to the senator. more generally. i voted against grammrudmanhollings because i knew we would have to arbitrarily cut worthy programs such as win. and i have joined the senator in voting to repeal that act for the same reason.
the senator from south dakota is correct in his charac-" terization of the reduction in funds for category "b" -children. i expect the house conferees to make a strong argument for the higher figure for "b" payments just as i intend to insist upon the $20 million increaseover the fiscal year 1986 presequestration levelwe have recommended in category "a" payments.
. while we have chosen  to adopt legislative language in our fiscal year 1987 appropriations bill to address this issue. believing that it should be addressed in the higher education act conference. we are aware there is concern over the confusion surrounding the departments verification regulations. we expect that the department will continue to evaluate the verification requirements. and will indicate how they intend to treat unintentional errors by institutions. when we go to conference on this appropriations bill. we will consider the need to develop conference report language that ensures that institutions are  held liable for unintended errors in the verification process during 1986.
i want to commend i am hopeful that senator weicker comi my colleague for his concern regarding and the other conferees will work in trai this invaluable program. and want to behalf of this important initiative in 01 assure him that only the authorization education reform by restoring funds affe( ceiling set at $478 millionpre- for the lead program. i thank the stan cluded the committee from including senator for his efforts. wou] additional funds provided in the mr. weicker. i thank.the distin- to budget resolution for this program. guished senator from rhode island con also. i want to assure my colleague for his comments. and appreciate his conc that i will most certainly do every- understanding of the fiscal constraints area thing possible to increase the appro- within which we are operating. the hea priation. which is  set at the au- senator and i have discussed this. -to s thorized ceiling of $478 million. should matter in the past several weeks. and i dem the authorization ceiling be increased. think i have made clear my support 
. i ask unanimous consent that the senate insist on its amendment to h.r. 5233. the fiscal year 1987 laborhealth and human services. education. and related agencies appropriation bill. request a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses. and the chair be authorized. to appoint conferees on the part of the senate.
. i suggest to the majority leader again that i am satisfied. as long as the point was raised and recognized as being a valid point. it can be worked out . worked out tonight. worked out at the end of the bill. as long as there is a recognition that the point that was made is valid. mr. dole% i have discussed it with the distinguished senator from florida . we have indicated two optionstwo revenue bills. we are  in the process of seeing which way we are going to go.
with the amounts of moneythat are poured into the evil which we are trying to eradicate. certainly we representing the u.s. government can come up with equivalent amounts or more to deal with a problem and do it in a way which shows some courage on our part and  trampling over the elements of our society that are indeed already the weakest and which need most of our special care.  doing it by giving the impression because we pass a bill that we have done the job. it is the passing of the bill that is the easiest thing around here. there is  a senator who does  k that. funding those bills. that is where the problem arises. and that is where the problem arises here. so i am satisfied. i support the senseofthesenate resolution. it takes care of the problem. we are  going to take it out of existing programs. we have commitments to that effect. but come that continuing resolution. unless there are new resources and additional allocations.  reallocation. then i can assure you that it is going to be a long time before any continuing resolution gets off this floor. we will meet our obligations as an appropriations committee. but we will meet them honestly as has always been the way under the distinguished chairman from oregon. this is great politics. this is great politics. this drug bill.  you are going to see an exercise in great finance and fiscal responsibility which follows on its heels. and it should  be any other way.
. i want to associate myself. unusually. with the comments of the distinguished senator from colorado and the distinguished senator from wisconsin. i made an agreement the other night. it was in two parts.  1 was a sense of the senate resolution which was read by the distinguished senator from new mexico. second was that we would go ahead at the end of this bill and waive the budget act. . that is  going to happen. and we are going on by guess and by gosh here that hopefully. after all the conferences are over and everything else is done. the tax bill signed and so forth. there is going to be some money to pay for it. but this is strictly guess work. i do  consider it responsive to the agreement which i made on this floor in order to avert extended debate on the drug bill. so. like my distinguished friend from colorado and my friend from wisconsin. i shall  pursue the point any further. i suppose the point that should be asked. and it is a good question to leave this debate on. is what happens if such moneys are  available and indeed. we have  met the mark. what happens if. to be continued.
. if this funding change was proposed for fiscal 1988 and subject to review or comment. but it is . it is instead to be made  in fiscal 1987. again this is a change made unilaterally by the department. congress and constituents of family planning services were kept completely in the dark. the conference report for the labor/hhs appropriations bill contains language urging that the title 10 program be left intact pending action on the reauthorization bill. and directing the secretary of hhs to administer the entire program for fiscal year 1987 in the same manner. and under the same allocation formula which governed program operations during fiscal year 1986. as chairman of the housesenate conference. i joined with my colleagues from the house in directing the secretary to refrain from making any changein either the guidelines or the allocation formulaat this time. if substantive changes are to be made in the family planning program. the reauthorization bill is the place to make them.  through the back door by administrative fiat as the department is attempting.
. recommended. and we will still have available to us our hoaria. and the combined total of those two will have us earning far more than the $120.000 that was proposed here. that will be paid partly by the taxpayers and partly by private interests. so i do  think that. either in a fiscal sense or in a moral sense. the interests of the nation have been served by this defeat.
 of the african national congress. despite the narrowsighted opposition of some. i believe this precedentsetting meeting was only the latest benefit of congressional urging of a multilateral approach to the factions of south africa. in addition. the state department has requested money for southern africa in its proposed supplemental for fiscal year 1987. congress needs to seize this opportunity quickly and show its readiness to followthrough on the promises and possibilities of the antiapartheid act. the southern africa development initiative will do just that.e
here is a chance to establish. republicans and democrats alike. what is important. and i think the budget. as presented by the distinguished senator from florida. does just that. i share with him the responsibility of the business of life in the appropriation committee. he is confronted with these personal cases day in and day out. as am i. and it is a pleasure to k that we  only look at those faces suffering from various ills and wants.  only look at them. and encourage them. but we come out here and appropriate the money or budget the money to deal with their needs. my distinguished friend. the senator from south carolina. senator hollings has responded to the need for opportunity with his additions to this budget for education programs. there is point in talking about the opportunities for our young people if the opportunities are  there. if they are  paid for. and if they are  provided for.
ial veto on legislation to implement the budget resolution. but in this. as in all matters. it is reality that we have to deal with and  politics and philosophy. the year is 1987. to my way of thinking. the priorities of the last 6 years. have brought us dangerously close to being imperiled in a variety of ways. the deficit speaks for itself. for all the protestations of fiscal responsibility. where does this deficit sit. it grows and grows. for all the protestations of wars on drugs and assistance to those who have aids. and on down the checklist. where is the money to do these things. realitythe reality of the world around us is what calls me to go ahead and vote for this legislation. i would hope that the time will come when  only will we have the courage to raise taxes. but we will also have to realize that those taxes are far better devoted to the business of life than to the business of death.
. i rise today as an original cosponsor of the developmental disabilities act amendments of 1987. this legislation will reauthorize the developmental disabilities act for 3 years and continue to strengthen the federal mandate for increasing the independence. productivity and integration of our nations developmentally disabled citizens. as the state of the art changes with respect to the provision of services for persons with disabilities. federal disability policy must evolve to ensure we are  attempting to solve todays problems with yesterdays solutions. since its creation 17 years ago. the developmental disabilities act has supported research and demonstrations that have provided the impetus for congress to continually refine its policies to keep up with our expanding kledge and understanding. and i- assist those with disabilities to lea y dignified and fulfilling lives. - during the last reauthorization. im y portant priorities were added to th act to emphasize independent livin and supported employment opportuni - ties for individuals with developmenta disabilities. in order to ensure expand ed opportunities for integration ol . such individuals into the communit3 and the workplace upon completion oj r their education. the reauthorization bill introducee ttoday contains numerous provisiom . which will further refine the progranu . authorized by the developmental dis. * abilities act. specifically. the bill will strengthen the ability of the state planning councils to ensure that all individuals who are developmentally disabled. including -individuals with mental or physical impairments or a combination thereof. will have access to -the supports and services necessary to enable them -to achieve their maximum potential. in -order to accomplish this objective. state planning councils are authorized to conduct policy analyses and other activities which will ultimately impact all individuals who are developmentally disabled. thus the state planning councils become a catalyst for changefrom accessing existing service systems and identifying service gaps. to attempting to mobilize systems and communities towards the goals of increased independence. productivity and integration for all who are developmentally disabled. at the same time that the legislation encourages this evolution. the bill xecognizes the importance of the disabled individual. the family. and members of the community in this process. aher major component of the developmental disabilities act is the protection and advocacy -system. which has been critical in protecting and advocating the rights of individuals with disabilities. these protection -and advocacy systems were mandated by congress in response to public .outcry against the abuse and neglect to which disabled persons were subjected. during this 10th anniversary of their establishment. the range of protection and advocacy system activities is broadand includes protection of individuals from abuse and neglect in institutions and nursing homes. assisting disabled children secure their right to a free. appropriate -public education. and advocating for accessible transportation and housing. among other activities. the reauthorization bill will enable these systems to continue their important work. and expand their authority to include investigation of incidences where there is probable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred. with special emphasis on miity populations who are developmentally disabled and in need of protection and advocacy services. the reauthorization bill retains the current focus for the university affiliated program and authorizes the secd retary to expand these systems in geographically unserved areas. the bill - also authorizes the secretary to establish a new grant program to enable g university affiliated programs to ex- amine areas of emerging national sig1 nificance. such as in the areas of early - intervention. the elderly disabled. and r the area training for community based -service programs. finally. the special projects section of the act has been changed to projects of national significance. again reflecting the role of the developmental disabilities act in support" ing projects which will ultimately ben1 efit all individuals with disabilities. thus the mandate of each of the programs authorized under the developmental disabilities act has been strengthened and refined through this * reauthorization. accordingly. the anthorization levels have been increased. since we can expect to expand and strengthen programs without adequate financial support. although small in comparison to other federal discretionary activities. funds from the developmental disabilities act have a multiplier effect. and stimulate additional funds from states and other organizations. clearly. these dollars represent a worthwhile investment. i urge my colleagues to join with me in reaffirming our federal commitment to all developmentally disabled americans through prompt consideration and passage of this reauthorization bill. and i would like to especially thank senator tom harkxn. chairman of the subcommittee on the handicapped. for his leadership in its development.
. the amendment being offered changes the congressional budget process and is being offered to a bill  reported by the senate budget committee. therefore. i raise the point of order pursuant to section 306 of the congressional budget act that the pending amendment is  in order.
. i rise to offer an amendment on the 5year program/budget mismatchan issue on which the distinguished chairman of the armed services committee. senator nunn. has spoken many times. the chairman of the armed services committee refers to tile 5year program/budget mismatch as the "bow wave" problem. the "bow wave" is a matter of having too many programs and  egh moneyas unbelievable as that may seem when congress is pumping about $300 billion a year into the defense budget. there is insufficient money available in the outyears to sustain the programs proposed in the budget. senator nunn sees this as "one of the worst problems we have in the defense budget ." it has far reaching implications. and he says it is going to get worse. hie suggest that it makes the coffeepot scandal look like a dime store operation. i agree completely. at septepzber.18. 1987 what i want to do is discuss the problem as it manifests itself during the budget review process in congress. the department of defense is giving congress inconsistent 5year program and budget information. the problem has two facets. first. there are two 5year defense plans for fiscal years 198892. the 5year plan submitted to congress in compliance with the congressional budget act of 1974. which appears in tle budget of the united states government and is basis for deficit projections. totals $1.72 trillion. the numbers in the congressional plan have been pulled out of thin air. they are  based on "hard" military requirements. they have  been translated into a detailed line item program plan. the secret.. pentagon five year defense program. kn as the fydp. by comparison. which is never given to congress. totals $1.8 trillion or about $77 billion more than the plan given to congress. the numbers in the budget years. fiscal year 1911889. are identical in both plans. the divergence occurs in the outycars roughly as follows: $25 billion for 1990. $25 billion for 1991. and $27 billion for 1992. rhe discrepancies between the two 5year plans were verified by the deputy inspector general of the defense department in a letter to tie dated april 30. 1987. i ask tnanimous consent that that letter be placed in the reconr.
i thank my distinguished colleague for his comments and believe me. to have those comments means everything to the substance of the matter before the senate. the fydp is a very important document. because it details how much money is available and who gets it. it embodies the numbers in the pentagon computers and is the result of perhaps 1 million manhours of staff work each year. it is the sum total of literally thousands of individual spending decisions. such as the f15 flying hour and spare parts programs. the purchase of aircraft carriers. and i he prodtction of the m1 tank. that the secretary of defense must make each year. secd. the line item data given to congre:s in support of the budget request. as presented in congessiotmi data she(ts. proctirenment prograins [p1] docuiments arid testimony. are derived from and consistent with the more costly internatl fyi)p. this is a flimflam operation. approval of the line items as they appear in the budget and congressioial data shucels would be in keeping with tle higher fydp top line. but the extra $77 billion needed to sustain those programs at ecolie rates has already been summarily carved from the outyears if one is to believe the 5year plait submitted to congress.
in response to my good friend from virginia. as he ks. we enjoy a very special relationship. both professionally and per- . fr. weicker.-]. could-  agree spent foreither the state department sonally. -and have already decided we more withthe remarks of the distin- kuthhozation or the foreign aid auare going to work on this matter to- guished senator from virginia. i k thorization. gether. and we will. and include any we have taken egh time. in rela- as is evident from the congressional others who care to go ahead and have tion to those who worked so hard on budget action. those expectations are -their input. i have problem with the instant legislation. but i just want  in compliance with fiscal reality.  that. we should be able to do so very to alert everybody that the matter is whether or  -this bill spends shortly. and bring it here to the floor. going to be before us again. it is just a egh money was long ago decided having said that. i want to make it matter as to whether we vote or as to by the budget resolution which asclear that even after the invocation of whether delay substitutes for the law. sumed a 5 percent reduction in all the act as it is . we can give exten- with those remarks spending. and in way bind the president and.  and that extensions would call it up. and that commitment more senior members of the commit. can be voted. in the meantime what.i will be made good. tee and aher member. .would like -to see is possibly something i would call it up immediately upon fourth. there are a lot of amend.coming forth from the distinguished the disposition of this pending meas- ments on this bill. yet this bill has - senator from virginia and myself ure. but i k that the distinguished been considered by the senate in less . which could be out here on the floor republican leader wants to move to than 4 days. that is. for those who :within a week or 2 weeks time. the verity ination. there are k the history of foreign policy leg-
would  the senator agree that i have the unusual burden on me of getting 60 votes.  a simple majority. again. the budget act contemplates that i should have that burden. if i meet that burden. why would this entail an offset. that is  in the cards. unless the senator wants it in the cards.
the answer to the distinguished senator from new hampshire is that under the current senate proposal. fewer grants will be funded. fewer grants will be funded for research in cancer. diabetes. heart disease. neurological disorders. et cetera. child health. arthritis. agingthan congress has funded in 1987. the world is  standing still. senator. inflation is there.
senator. there is only one part of this budget that gets a real growth. increase. and you k what that is. it is defense. it gets the raise and i am telling you that you have got fewer grants. you have fewer grants just asi ask for the regular order.
here are the magic figures being discussed. lumping the discretionary and mandatory together. what the senator from new hampshire is after is the discretionary. the answer is  there has  been an 8 or 9 percent increase in the discretionary. let us understand where the figures are and  just float out a figure of 8 or 9 percent increase. there is a small increase.  even equal to that of inflation. insofar as the total laborhhs discretionary budget is concerned. and. senator. there are two parts of the budget. .
reserving the right to object. obviously the distinguished majority leader is aware of the fact that there are matters to be discussed by various senators on both sides of the aisle to deal with the very subject that he mentioned. the budget deficit. and i was wondering exactly what it is that is going to transpire at 5 oclock this aftern if we are to stand in recess until 5. i do  quite understand the pattern of things. i was wondering whether the distinguished majority leader might illuminate.
. i rise in strong support of s. 373. the robert t. stafford elementary and secondary education improvement act of 1987. this important legislation was reported out of the labor and human resources committee without a single dissenting vote. a tribute to the capable leadership of the distinguished chairman and ranking miity member of the education subcommittee. senators pell and stafford. s. 373 reaffirms our commitment to access and quality in elementary and secondary education through improvements to existing programs. and a number of new initiatives. the legislation combines into one omnibus authorization all federal aid to elementary and secondary education. including chapter 1 compensatory education for the disadvantaged. the chapter 2 block grant. impact aid. magnet schools. the education for ecoic security act. bilingual education. the womens educational equity act. assistance to the virgin islands. and ellender fellowships. while these programs currently expire- at various times between fiscal year 1987 and fiscal year 1989. they will  all be due for reauthorization in fiscal year i)ecember 1. 1987 this legislation continues the emously successful chapter 1 compensatory education program for disadvantaged children. which this year serves approximately 5 million children. or one in nine students at the elementary and secondary school level. funds provided for chapter 1 reach nearly 90 percent of the nations school districts. and assist these districts to provide remedial math and reading services to needy children. s. 373 seeks to strengthen the chapter 1 program by making amendments in a number of key areas. including strengthening parental involvement. improving the targeting of chapter 1 funds so that the neediest eligible children receive services. and encouraging ination. expansion. and program improvement. the bill before us continues the chapter 1 program to assist handicapped children for whom the responsibility to provide a free. appropriate public education rests with the state education agencies. this program. kn as the public law 89313 program. will remain a distinct source of federal financial assistance for education of these children. although amendments are included to bring it into greater conformance with the requirements of public law 94142 with regard to due process protections. reporting. data collection. and administration. the bill also will prohibit states from counting 3 to 5 year olds under the public law 89313 program after fiscal year 1991. unless the state education agency has assured that services are available to all eligible 3to 5yearold handicapped children. this provision is consistent with the amendments made by public law 99457 to the education of the handicapped act. last year to encourage all states to educate preschool hajidi. capped children. clearly. it would be inappropriate to allow states which do  provide services under public law 94142 to all eligible 3- to 5yearold children. to serve a limited number of those children tinder public law 89313.. the federal investment in elementary and secondary education is an investment in the nations most precious resource: our children. i urge the passage of this legislation. and i again want to commend the chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts to achieve a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support. finally. i e with regret that this bill is one of the last major pieces of education legislation that will beat the mark of my good friend. senator stafford. his unfailing compassion. wit. and sensitivity to the needs of those less fortunate in our society. will be sorely missed.
bon jour the distinguished senator from washington concluded his eloquent remarks exactly at the point i would like to start because the first thing i am going to do is to read an article that was published in 1977. almost a decade ago: it was published in u.s. news & world report. "pro and conuse tax dollars to elect congress." congressman mo udall of arizona went ahead and advocated: "yeswe have to respond to evolving conditions." and an interview with senator lowell weicker. jr.. republican of connecticut. "he whole idea of public financing stinks." so i am going to pick right up as to what my comments were on amendments to the original act which we are trying to reform again today. and as the senator from washington says if we got through the reform. which i do  think is going to happen. believe me. 10 years from  we would be reforming the reform of the reform. q. senator weicker. why are you against using public funds to finance congressional campaigns. a. i think the whole of idea of public financing stinks. what youd be doing is subsidizing mediocrity. youd be taking away from the people of this country one of the checks which they have on their government: specifically. the power to politically utilize their resources. what particularly nettles me is that ive heard federal financing of campaigns referred to as a watergate reform. this is absolutely wrong. the senate watergate committee explicitly opposed public financing in its final report. i can only say that if there is to be "watergate reform" of our election process. more power should be put in the hands of the people less. q. your view is that public financing increases the governmerts powera. it is a raid on taxpayers money for the support of failing politicians. politicians should get out and earn their votes. earn support. a time of declining faith in politiclans is time to reward them financially. in essence. you are eliminating competition in our election process. youre saying that a warm body is egh to get money. i see tile distinguished senator from maine eagerly receiving these remarks along with his colleague. senator harkin. and i am delighted that two such good friends should be on the floor during the course of these remarks. they are. i can assure you. more than warm bodies. these are two of the finest senators that enter this body. and i assure you that whatever financial rewards come to them at election time. are well deserved.
 grant in popularity. the harness horse is as much a part of america today as of its past. twenty million fans attended harness racing at events last year. it is a $2 billion business that furnishes $100 million in tax revenue and tens of thousands of jobs to grooms. drivers. trainers. veterinarians. and the like. two of the oldest and best kn races. the breeders crown and the hambeltonian. held in saratoga springs and the meadowlands respectively. traditionally take place in the first week of august. it is therefore fitting that the congress of the united states designate this week "national harness racing week."s by mr. graham (for himself.
. i ask unanimous consent that a summary of the joint tax return for 1987 of my wife and myself be printed in the record. this information is submitted in addition to my public financial disclosure statement for 1987 which was filed with the secretary of the senate today. the information provided here exceeds any requirement of law and is submitted in the spirit of complete financial disclosure.
the final dod budget decisions [pbds] contained in the january 1987 fydp carved $35 billion from the first 2 years. of the fydp-$18.4 billion in 1988 and $17.1 billion in 1989. bringing the fydp and the presidents budget into rou..h blaance for fiscal year 198889. but left a massive $81.3 billion mismatch in the outyears where only mi adjustments were made. the january fydp and the presidents budget are compared on the table below: (in k "n3 t do las nit al l988 1989 1990 1991 1992 ioa. yp.

. just two quick words of thanks. first. to the chairman of the subcommittee. lawton chiles. ody could have been more caring about those persons this committee serves.  could anybody be more conscious of obligations to meet those needs within the budget constraints imposed on ourselves by this government. i just want to express a deep. personal appreciation to senator chiles. this is the last time he will be functioning in this capacity. except within the conference and when conference report comes to the senate for final action. the senator from florida is a true gentleman. a great senator. and a human being of emous compassion. lastly. i would like to pay a special tribute to the miity staff. led by maureen byrnes. the staff includes terry muilenburg. craig higgins. riki sheehan. and dona pate. i wish to recognize all of them for their work on this effort. this bill is something i think that all can be proud of. both the miity and majority. most particularly i think my colleagues can be proud of the bill given all the controversy attached to it. the fact is. it will stand on its own two feet. it will  be part of a continuing resolution.
 johnsons proposed tax increase may be affected by an unexpected decline in businessmens capital spending during the last 2 months. it had been anticipated spending for new plant and equipment the first quarter of 1967 would increase $1.5 billion from the $62.8 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate of last years fourth quarter. but projections issued by the commerce department yesterday put the current quarters capital investment rate at $62.6 billion. the first actual decline in the rate since 1963. public law 89800 was passed last year. which suspended until december 31. 1967. the 7percent investment credit. with the idea of helping alleviate the money panic we found ourselves in last year. the indication from the commerce department yesterday of the continued slowdown of the u.s. ecoy. particularly capital investment. would seem to represent a giant step backward in the administrations attempt to combat inflation. many businessmen in the 29th congressional district are calling attention to layoffs of employees they have been required to make because of reduced purchase orders from major buyers. the individual businessman and corporations that face these ecoic hardships have expressed to me the condition is primarily the result of the suspension of the 7percent investment tax credit last fall. i believe it is time for congress to recognize the need to restore the 7percent investment credit and accelerated depreciation for commercial and industrial buildings. i have asked consent that a letter to me from alco products. inc.. of schenectady. n.y.. and an article from the wall street journal pertaining to the tax credit suspension be printed in the record.
 delivered his message to the house also urging the restoration of the 7percent investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation. . i  ask that we vote favorably on h.r. 6950. and want to compliment the committee on ways and means for their prompt action. which i feel. along with many employees and employers in my district. will go a long way m alleviating the terrible effects of the tax credit suspension. i trust this action has  come too late to reverse the purchase and employment trend that has caused such hardships.
. the grounds for this veto were that it would be an inflationary measure. it is my view that the veto did very little toward stemming the flow of inflation. but it did make the families of federal employees potentially greater victims of inflation for aher year.  we. the congress. have the opportunity to correct that by passing this legislation.
. i believe that by this sort of creative federalism. where our national government seeks ways to assist and promote the tax collecting function of the states through mutually voluntary cooperation. we can best solve the problems that beset state and local governments. therefore. i strongly urge immediate and sympathetic consideration of h.r. 12761 so that this onerous situation may soon be dealt with.
 or budget bureau or appropriations committee to balance the budget by eliminating all or part of the annual reduced rate appropriation would be great. i support the approach taken by the gentleman from montana. for i believe. as he does. that the post office is a service organization and that those public services authorized by the congress should be paid for with funds from the general treasury
 nixons new federalismhas been stalled in congress for almost 2 years. some 400 grantinaid programs are operated by the federal government for the presumed benefit of local government. most are overregulated and underfunded. and the inexhaustible number of guidelines cause waste and frustration. but instead of meeting the particular needs of each community or area. the regulations force local governments to engage professional programing and planning staffs to unravel the federal bureaucracy and then make exhaustive cases for whatever federal program comes closest to matching the need. the inefficiency and waste inherent in such a system is evident. the solution would be enactment of a revenuesharing program in which each local unit of government would be guaranteed an equitable share of the federal tax dollar. i have had drawn up a discharge petition which has been placed in the hands of the clerk of the house. directing the ways and means committee to report out the revenuesharing bill for action by the full house of representatives. i am confident that the sentiment of the house favors positive action on this measure and i hope that without regard to partisanship my colleagues will sign the discharge petition forthwith so that there can be action on it in the remaining month of the 91st congress. i can only hope that the interests of the taxpayer will win out in this crucial battle. victory will mean a major overhaul of our countrys revenue system. to do less. i believe. would be the grossest irresponsibility. and a major threat to the ecoic wellbeing of the nation.
senator dodd spoke of a campaign deficit. in fact. a letter of invitation from mr. barbieri referred to a campaign deficit. did the committee establish the fact that there did exist a campaign deficit in 1965.
mr. barbieris letter of solicitation said they were soliciting the money to pay the campaign deficit of senator dodd. my question was whether a campaign deficit existed at the time the letter was written by mr. barbieri.
i asked the question to obviously determine whether. at the time the money was solicited from the public at this testimonial dinner in hartford. conn.. as i recall. there was in existence a campaign deficit. as was stated in the letter of solicitation. for if in fact the committee had asked for money to pay off that campaign deficit and there was  in fact a campaign deficit. that would be a misrepresentation and a fraud on the public. my question is to determine whether or  at that time senator dodd did have a campaign deficit. if he says the campaign deficit for the campaign of 1964 was $6.000someodd and the senator from mississippi has said that there were in various accounts at that time the sum of $55.000odd. the next question i wanted to ask was whether those sums of $55.000odd were encumbered at that time. i take it senator dodd has said additional campaign deficits came in after the statement was filed with the state of connecticut. after the $6.000 campaign deficit was declared. will the senator enlighten us how much money had to be paid over and above the $6.000 which was declared to the state of connecticut that was actually paid out of the $55.000 fund.
the committee has made its report. the senator from louisiana has said he will  make his statement until he is convinced that the entire senate has had an opportunity to ask questions. certain evidence has come to light. some evidence came out in response to a question from the distinguished senior senator from arkansas when he asked about the dinners and what their purpose was and how the money was used. some evidence has come out from the questions asked by the distinguished senator from illis . i think at this time that we ought to exhaust all of our questions because i take it that the distinguished senator from louisiana . counsel for senator dodd in this case. wants to be sure prior to making his remarks that senators have exhausted every opportunity to ask questions. they presumably will  call witnesses before us. the only person that we can really question is senator dodd himself. we are therefore directing our questions to him. on one of the questions which i raised. i was  satisfied with the answer i received from either senator dodd or the committee. i had hoped that senator dodds staff or the committee staff in the interim period might get some information to clarify the situation. that question concerns the deficit. if there was a deficit. in 1965. and the reason this disturbs me is that if someone is going to send out letters for a dinner to pay off a deficit. it should first be established whether there was a deficit. cxiii- 1010part 12 i k there was a deficit in 1959 because senator dodd has testified that there was a deficit of $150.000 in 1959. however. we are talking about 1965 when these dinners were held and the letters were sent out. specifically a letter by  said that information pertaining to this matter came before the committee. am i correct in this statement.
i modify my amendment to read as follows: on page 94. strike lines 4 through 16. inclusive. and insert in lieu thereof the following: "(4) to any other than those categories of persons specified in section 4 of the federal firearms act of 1938 (15 u.s.c. 904) any destructive device. machine gun (as defined in section 5848 of the internal revenue code of 1954). shortbarreled shotgun. or shortbarreled rifle."
the maritime authorization bill. as reported from committee. would make possible the allocation of $122 million more than was originally requested by the administration. it would make possible the construction of 27 ships. or nearly three times the number originally planned for by the department of commerce. uligated funds already available for this purpose total $103.3 million. with the proposed increase of $117.6 million. the total amount available for construction and modernization would be $340.7 million. or only $4 million less than the total requested by the administration for the entire bill. while i agree both in principle and in practice that our merchant marine should be modernized. i seriously question the advisability of adopting such provisions at this time. the authorization requested by the executive branch. together with the unexpended funds already available for ship construction. will certainly sustain an adequate building program until the present extreme pressures on the budget are relieved. when the heavy burdens in vietnam are eased. and we all pray that they will be eased in the near future. there will be ample time to increase the authorization for the purposes which this legislation is designed to promote. but today. when a majority of congress is calling for reallocation of federal expenditures to our critical domestic priorities. when a majority of congress is calling for a tax increase and a total reduction of several billion dollars in the federal budget. is  the time to expand the maritime authorization. for this reason i strongly urge that the amendment of the senator from delaware be adopted.
. i consider this a fair arrangement. but in view of the senates acceptance yesterday of the amendment offered by the senator from maryland. indicating that the pending legislation would  seek to increase fees or taxes on gun owners. i have prepared language to delete this provision. i send this language to the desk and ask that my amendment be modified accordingly.
. i have long made clear that i am committed to firm oversight of our defense expenditures. at the same time. however. i feel an obligation to speak out when it appears that proposed ecoies may be false ones. with this in mind. i feel i should offer some comment on the proposal by the senator from maryland to reduce the department of defenses emergency funds by onehalf. i am well aware that in recommending an emergency fund of $100 million. the committee exceeded the previous amount authorized for this purposes. but i also believe that a 50percent reduction in this amount is too great a cut. my reasons for holding this position may be stated quite simply. the subcommittee on research and development. on which i was hoed to serve. recommended. and the full committee has endorsed. major reductions in the proposed department of defense budget for research and development. those reductions amount to over $1 billion. the most substantial cut in any sector of the budget and one which will affect many programs which the department of defense considered vital. having exercised such a stringent review of this element of the budget already. it is my belief that the department should have somewhat greater latitude in regard to the emergency fund. these funds will permit the department to manage more sensibly the effective reduction of effort which this legislation will provide. i consider a reasonable degree of flexibility very desirable. and in view of the magnitude of the cuts already contemplated. i believe the emergency fund is a prudent device for improved management of the department of research and development programs in a period of substantial reorientation. for example the committee report indicates the considerable uncertainties which afflict the whole question of air defense. both with respect to the defense of the continental united states and with respect to forward defense of our men in the field. should they be engaged against an enemy with significant tactical air capability. there are quite fundamental questions about the size and nature of air defenses which should be provided. the committee directed a deferral of work on the airborne warning and control systemawacslargely because of the doubts about the likely bomber threat to the united states. similarly. in the relatively brief time we had to consider the matter in the subcommittee and in the full body. the necessity for the promising samd system remained unclear. so far as defense of the field army and the continental united states is concerned. it seems clear that this system would provide both more potent and less costly defense than the present capabilities. namely. the nikehercules and hawk missile forces. the present weapons are extremely expensive to maintain. if we are going to provide extensive air defense in the future. we may later wish to proceed with the samd techogy. thus. the deletion of funds for samd was accomplished with some trepidation on the part of many of us in the committee and was written in primarily because of thu compulsion we felt to reduce the overall budget. at the same time. however. the committee has directed the secretary of defense to review the bomber defense requirement in detail and to submit findings and recommendations in connection with the fiscal 1971 budget. since the department has argued that samd is one of the most critical programs bearing on future air defense efforts. it may well choose to use a portion of the flexible funding authority under section 202 to sustain a minimum level of effort on samd pending this full reexamination of the need for a more advanced air defense capability. this is but one example of how such authority might be put to constructive use. there are many occasions in a large and fastmoving techogical effort. of which the departments total r. & d. program is the principal example. when the capacity to feed money into a critical area can prove invaluable. particularly since the departments r.d.t. & e. budget has a large and pressing backlog of projects competing for funds. i do  consider this emergency authority excessive. indeed my view is similar to that voiced in the senate the other day by the distinguished junior senator from maryland . i tend to believe that our defense effort should emphasize the techogical advantages we have accrued. and that we should seek to control our total defense expenditure principally by strict limits on premature commitments to procurement of expensive systems and by reducing our conventional forces with their costly manpower levels to the extent feasible. the other side of the coin is that. if we are to stress techogical advantages in maintaining a strong national security posture. we can skimp on our r. & d. effort. considering the 12.7percent cut already imposed on the total r.d.t. & e. authorization. i believe that ample emergency funding is both important and desirable. accordingly. while i could  support the $50 million recommended in the original amendment. i believe the compromise which has been worked out does allow for a sufficient degree of flexibility in the program. the revised amendment will therefore have my support.
i think it would deprive the universities of work on national defense. i am sure the senator would agree that it would weaken one of our best guarantees that open and objective research and counsel.  alleged pressures of a "militaryindustrial" complex are shaping the defense policy. i am sure the senator would agree that thus. universities themselves should determine whether and under what circumstances they should engage in defense research. this is a matter we should leave up to the universities and  something we should establish as a matter of policy or mandate. such programs should  be terminated by congressional flat. defensesponsored social science research abroad is already down by 70 percent since fiscal 1968 and all proposals are  subject to thorough interagency review under state department auspices. it is a highly dubious and antiintellectual proposition to assume that research on foreign areas somehow increases likelihood of u.s. military involvement. with all due respect. i do  believe that is so.
. in the senates action on the proposal by the senator from tennessee . we reach a crucial test of our responsibilities to the american people and to the american ecoy. as yesterdays department of commerce report indicated. projected investment decisions for early 1970 show aher startling and inflationary jump. if this one indicator is matched in other areas. unacceptable inflation may well continue for many months. under the circumstances. any increase in personal exemptions will. in fact. be illusory. especially because such an increase is bound to fuel the very inflation that destroys the benefits it offers. the only durable tax relief. the only relief that survives inflation. is likely to be adjustment in tax rates themselves. when such relief through the tax rates is matched by adequate tax reform to close loopholes and maintain government revenues. i believe the result is more equitable and less damaging to the ecoy. however appealing a simple increase in personal exemption is. we can sacrifice our judgment on the vital needs of the ecoy to such an illusory change. i certainly commend senator percy. senator gore. and all other senators who have been seeking a compromise on this difficult issue.
however. for the reasons i have just stated briefly. i have concluded that the wisest course. the course which best supports our efforts to curb inflation and to maintain revenues to undertake the essential programs of social construction. lies in rejecting any change in personal exemptions at this time. the sound course. in my judgment. is to follow the general lines of the house dill and of the committee bill. millions of lowincome families will be removed from the tax rolls. and all taxpayers will benefit from direct tax rate reductions. let us  undermine these real advances by a selfdefeating increase in personal exemptions which will only prolong the ecoic crisis which is  reducing the buying. power of every american family. . i urge the senate to reject the gore amendment.
. i am disturbed by the inclusion of gifts of appreciated property to charity under the minimum income tax proposed by this amendment. i believe that this addition. offers significant problems for our nations colleges and universities. the senate finance committee stated in its report that it did  consider it wise to include gifts of appreciated property under the 5 percent minimum tax provision. as the bill reported from the committee contains a number of other provisions directly aimed at curtailing the tax advantages resulting from such gifts. the principal effect of including gifts of appreciated property in the minimum tax is to reduce the benefit of the contribution and thereby further and unduly restrict the support of worthwhile public charitable institutions. it has been suggested that this provision of amendment  368 still retains a large incentive for gifts of appreciated property to charity. a person would still have a choice of either giving the property to charity and being taxed on the amount of the appreciated value at a rate  to exceed 15 percent or selling this property and pay the capital gain tax. which could be as high as 45 percent. in essence. the incentive would lie in the difference between the minimum tax proposed in this amendment and the new capital gain rate. it is assumed that one would choose the option offering the lower rate of taxation. however. many dos may choose  to subject themselves to such taxation at either rate and may simply pass the property to their heirs. as a result. i believe much property that might otherwise go to charity would be withheld by a prospective do. to many charitable institutions. the uncertainty already engendered by this bill has been evident in a decline in donations that they might otherwise receive. as with the municipal bond market. when taxation of municipal bond interest had been considered. charitable giving is  suffering from damaging uncertainty. in effect. the incentive to give is already adversely affected by its tax status. i would hope that the senate would do hing to add to this deleterious situation. for many months . i have been working with academic institutions in massachusetts to identify problem areas in this legislation. our colleagues on the finance committee have remedied a number of serious defects in the house version of this bill. which would surely have reduced the access of these institutions to important sources of private contributions. it would be most adverse to add this provision to the bill. for it would undermine important incentives for private support of our colleges and universities.
. the december issue of nations business contains an excellent and deserved tribute to our friend and colleague. the distinguished senior senator from delaware. john williams always merits our deepest respect and attention. but his efforts in the last few weeks have truly been gargantuan. he has detected and helped to correct innumerable flaws in the tax bill. he has stood on the floor of the senate day after day. defending the public interest and serving as a beacon and a guide for many of his less fiscalminded colleagues. seldom has he deserved our praise more than at the conclusion of the consideration of this lengthy and complex tax proposal. it is for this reason that i take particular pleasure in asking unanimous consent to have printed in the record the text of the article entitled "a giant is leaving the senate."
. "reduce taxes for some while raising prices for all." this is  a partisan issue. though partisanship has been clearly in evidence more often than  in this debate. this is  a regional or sectional issue.  is it an issue even between conflicting private and public interests. we are dealing with an issue which clearly and deeply affects us all. the question before us is hing less than the purchasing power of the dollar in domestic and international trade. it is a matter which affects the single taxpayer. the workingman. the welfare mother. the retired pensioner. the small businessman. and the giant corporation all at once. inflation may hurt some more than others. but e of us remains untouched. as much as i favor the tax reform provisions of this bill and as urgent as i consider its social security provisions and related features. i can support the bill in its present form. the price is simply too high. it is my profound hope that the conference committee will preserve the progressive elements of this legislation and produce a measure which senators can support wholeheartedly. but if the conferees can remedy the central defects of this legislation. i will be compelled to vote " on the report.
 and the congress would be enabled to cut taxes quickly if that were determined to be a helpful means of stimulating demand in the private sector. this modest device is  a panacea for the troubles of our complicated ecoy. it is merely one tool for improving our capacity to harness that ecoy in the interests of all our people. american citizens have a right to expect that our political leaders will find means of making our constitution responsive to the requirements of modem times. i believe this proposal contributes to that goal. integrated with appropriate expenditure controls and adaptive monetary policy. more vigorous and flexible application of the revenue power will advance the cause of rational management of our freeenterprise system. i hope that this proposal will generate a wide consensus in the congress and in the country. with such a consensus i am confident we can devise the inations which will insure greater ecoic security for every american. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent that. at the next printing. the names of the senator from ohio . the senator from missouri . the senator from west virginia . the senator from rhode island . and the senator from michigan be added as cosponsors of s. 3715. the flexible fiscal policy act.
. i ask unanimous consent that at the next printing the names of the junior senator from new york and the junior senator from south dakota be added as cosponsors of s. 3715. the flexible fiscal policy act.
. there is an old english saying that once may be an accident. twice a coincidence. but three times is a moral certainty. today it may be fair to go nearly that strong in suggesting that there are solid signs of an ecoic resurgence in the united states. these signs have come up without the simultaneous selfconsuming flames of inflation destroying the effect of that ecoic upswing. the latest indication that the ecoic.climate is improving is the preliminary report by the bureau of labor statistics that. for the first time since long before the nixon administration took office. there is an actual decline in the wholesale price index. during august that index has declined by onehalf of 1 percent. this is a major decline. newspaper accounts hasten to point out that the effects of this decline may be exaggeratedand i myself do  wish to overemphasize its importance. but. taken together with the optimistic reports we have been receiving from the council of ecoic advisers. we  have solid evidence to support the contention that the inflationary spiral has been broken. it may be weeks. or a month or more. before the wholesale index decline is followed by lower prices at the marketplace. but it  appears assured that this will follow and that for the first time in a decade the buying power of the american dollar will actually show a slight increase instead of a continual erosion. of course. there will be ecoists who scoff at this indication of something better in the offing. it is to their political advantage to scoff. and so we should expect them to scoff. there are those who maintain that the nations ecoy will be in poor condition. and that this will be the biggest single issue during this falls election. those who make it such an issue obviously hope to gain votes by doing so. to gain such votes they will put emphasis on gloom and predictions of disaster. of recession or even depression. there has already been some considerable talk by certain officeseekers of a recession in the midst of inflation. and so forth. these selfserving predictors of ecoic doom will continue to preach along this vein. the facts. however. againand  more than everappear to belie their words. they will have to find some other issue upon which to run for office. the one to which they  cling is too slender to hold their weight. for their own purposes they have wished the nations ecoy to decline. they have wanted people to believe that inflation means a good ecoy. that a lessened purchasing ability is good because. for some. it may be accompanied by more. though cheaper. dollars in the pocket. they are being proved wrong. the stability of our ecoic fabric is being restored. the benefits to all are apparent. the decline in the wholesale price index is only one more of a series of indications that the policy of fiscal responsibility is working.
it does  matter if we are spending more of our gross national product or whether they are spending more of their gross national product. the fact is that we are both spending billions and billons of dollars in an insane nuclear arms race. and that it has to stop.
 on september .11. 1970. during the present fiscal year and to cover obligatory pay increases. this will enable the commission to reach and assist in a limited fashion state and local communities. groups and associations such as professional associations. service organizations. patriotic groups and historical and heritage societies. in theirinitial planning of commemorative programs. the increase in funding will be used primarily for staff and related costs to accomplish these objectives. by mr. dole :
. recent administration statements have indicated that serious consideration is being given to the request of the lockheed aircraft corp. for a federal guarantee prior to proceeding with the production of the lockheed air bus. i appreciate the magnitude of the problems which have afflicted the lockheed corp. as a result of previous major contracts. while i do  wish at this time to comment on the merits of the corporations proposal. i do wish to point out one potentially grave inconsistency inherent in its presentation. we are faced with a persistently high level of unemployment throughout our country. lockheed is one of the more severely affected corporations. indeed. a major justification for the proposed guarantee is the alleged need to assure the jobs of lockheeds employees. yet the proposed guarantee would also include the manufacturer of jet engines for the air buswhich happens to be british  american. as the distinguished junior senator from ohio and other senators have pointed out in colloquy in this body. american jet engine manufacturers are both capable and willing to enter into negotiations with lockheed to supply an engine for the air bus. is the airframe industry any more important to this country than the jet engine and allied industries. is the employment of lockheed workers any more desirable than the employment of persons by general electric or prattwhitney. i believe that these are questions which the lockheed aircraft corp. would do well to consider. it may well be that there are overriding reasons why a domestic manufacturer was  chosen. but given the present fiscal and ecoic situation. an allu.s.-produced aircraft might be a more appropriate recipient of federal guarantees than the present domesticforeign hybrid. until this question is resolved. however. i believe it would be inappropriate for congress to address itself to the larger issues posed by the request for a guarantee.
i am very glad the senator has cleared this up. the legislative history may be helpful. let me say that i remember the days of the sputnik. when the federal government was encouraging the best brains in the country and in the high schools particularly. to go to college and pursue engineering and scientific careers. many of them did. we have many of them in my state of massachusetts along what is called route 128 in the field of electronics. but  the federal government has changed its policy and has cut back on space. i am very grateful for that because we need to rearrange the priorities of the nation. but we have an abundance. a surplus of engineers and scientists who have been trained. at government insistence. to go into a field and a policy which we were pursuing at that time. and many of them are without jobs.  if we train x number of thousands of persons for the foreign service. i want to be sure that we have egh jobs for them. or at least that they will be able to do some work and earn a living. and  have foreign experts going around the country with jobs in which they can utilize their training.
 in his ecoic proposals.  he has asked congress to do that which it can do. under its powers. and i am very hopeful that he will get the support he needs. i. for one. intend to give him that support. i am sure that many of my colleagues will give him that support and that together we can work toward bringing this country to a healthy ecoic condition. based upon sound fiscal and monetary policies.
. i would like to express my personal gratitude to my distinguished colleague and friend. senator mondale. for the experience and kledge that he has brought to our joint effort. his past efforts on behalf of the socially and ecoically disadvantaged are as monumental as they are wide ranging. this body and our nation are in his debt for the significant contributions he has made. i understand that senator mondale will speak on this subject tomorrow.
. natick laboratories can serve its purpose. or ours. on a budget of $4 million for fiscal year 1972. i therefore strongly urge that the pending amendment. increasing the authorization from $4 million to the budget request of $6.2 million. be approved forthwith.
. many millions of americans stand to benefit emously from the textile agreement which was reached last week with our four largest asian trading partners: japan. hong kong. taiwan. and korea. nearly 2.3 million people are employed by the textile and apparel industryone out of every eight americans working in manufacturing industries. the industry is the chief customer of 675.000 cotton farmers. the sole customer of 200.000 wool growers. and an important customer for producers -of machinery. plastics. synthetic materials. dyestuffs. and chemicals. import penetration of the u.s. market increased over the last 5 years by almost 200 percent for manmade fiber products. and 32 percent for woolen products. during that time over 700 textile and apparel firms closed. and capital expenditures for new plant and equipment for the textile industry declined from $820 million in 1966 to $580 million in 1971. employment in the industry declined by over 100.000 workers during the last two and a half years and the federal government estimates that without import restraints. industry jobs lost might have reached a quarter of a million. the agreements which we have reached with our trading partners will substantially reduce the growth of manmade fiber and woolen imports to annual rates ranging between 5 and 7.5 percent from the high 70 percent growth level achieved in the first 8 months of 1971 for manmade fiber textile imports from these four asian suppliers. as imports are effectively limited. our textile and apparel industry will be able to improve its competitiveness and thereby expand production and employment. but more than the textile industry stands to benefit. every american will gain from the balanceofpayments implications of these agreements. the current textile and apparel trade deficit is the largest deficit for any industrial sector. it is estimated at $2.15 billion for 1971. which is greater than the expected annual overall trade deficit of $2 billion. 1971 will in fact see the first trade deficit for this country since 1893. a trade deficit means loss of jobs. lack of competitiveness of american products abroad. and a generally weakened ecoy. the correction of a situation which has contributed heavily to this deficit will help to strengthen our ecoy. and coisequently will benefit us all. the implications of these textile agreements for the american people are explained more fully in a speech recently delivered by stanley nehmer. deputy assistant secretary of commerce for resources. at the annual convention of the defense supply association in washington. i ask unanimous consent that the complete text of his remarks be printed in the record.
. i can well understand the considerations which led the foreign relations committee to cut cxviii954--part 12 the usia budget by $45 million. congress is charged with the responsibility for appropriating funds to the departments. agencies. and branches of this government. the appropriations function can best be carried out on the basis of full information regarding both the current and anticipated levels of operation. where such information is  available. or where it is deliberately withheld. the capacity of the congress to act responsibly is correspondingly reduced. i realize that some of these considerations entered into the proposed cutback in funding for usia. even so. i can in good conscience support so large a reduction in operating funds for this agency. some federal programs can sustain budget reductions. and either reduce their operations or concentrate their efforts on securing supplemental funding. without grave injury either to their own function or to the welfare of this country. such is  the case with the u.s. information agency.
. i rise in support of the amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the appropriations committee. senator mcclellax. this amendment would require annual appropriations of revenue sharing funds. with the total amount over a 5year period equaling the amount authorized by the pending legislation. the permanent rules of the senate provide that. to the extent possible. appropriations shall be made annually. each committee of the senateexcept the appropriations committee--can make annual authorizations of funds for programs within its jurisdiction. but only the committee on appropriations traditionally has had the authority to appropriate moneys for the various programs. this procedure has stood us in good stead for many years. circumvention of this rational and established procedure. by permitting an authorizing committee of the senate to make a firm commitment of funds for a 5year period is. in my judgment. fiscally irresponsible. it also establishes a dangerous precedent which we may well live to regret. the amendment proposed by chairman mcclellan would  reduce in any way the funds allocated to revenue sharing. it would simply provide that they would be subjected. on an annual basis. to the scrutiny of the appropriations process. $2.65 billion would be appropriated to cover expenses in the fiscal year just past. while $5.45 billion would be appropriated for fiscal year 1973. thus. a total of $8.1 billion would be available immediately. leaving $21.475 billion to be allocated over the next 3 years. i believe that this approach is both equitable and wise. and the amendment has my strong support.
. i heard the remarks of the distinguished senator from rhode island. and he was  saying at all that we are trying to tell the local governments what to do. there is dispute about the fact that we want all local governments to be able to spend this revenuesharing money. there is doubt about that. i think that probably every member of the appropriations committee wants to vote for revenue sharing. we believe in it. there is question about that. but it is being left up to the people so that if something goes wrong in the program. they can get rid of the mayor. most mayors are elected for 4 years. so we have to wait for 4 years to get rid of the mayor. in the meantime. we have built in an ironclad contract to spend $30 billion in the revenuesharing program without any real legislative oversight. without any accountability other than that already discussed by the chairman of the committee. i can see what the danger is. point outto us what the danger is in the compromise the chairman of the appropriations committee is offering. we are providing for advances of money here so that they do  have to wait a year. they k the money is coming in. we have done everything we could. at the same time keeping within the rules of the senate and within the jurisdiction of the appropriations committee. and in keeping with good accountability and good legislative oversight. where is the danger in accepting the proposal in the amendment.
. i am certainly pleased to hear that from the distinguished majority leader. because actually this amendment provides any period or periods exceeding a total of 90 days in any fiscal year. which is certainly a reasonable period of time will come under the reimbursable clause. if it goes beyond that. then of course the secretary would have to make his case by reporting to congress that in his opinion that reimbursable detail is in the best interests of the state department and the united states. and therefore it should be upon a reimbursable basis. i do  see anything in this amendment which would be harmful. certainly.  only to the state department but to any other department or agency in the federal government. i believe that we ought  to shackle the secretary of state with restrictions that do  allow him any flexibility at all to assign personnel on a reimbursable basis when he believes that it is in the best interests of the state department and the united states. and when the head of the receiving agency or department believes that it is  solely in the interests of that particular department or agency of the federal government. i do  think that we have something here. as the distinguished majority leader has said. that is of great magnitude. but i do think it is important that the secretary of state have this flexibility.
s budget message and the drafting of the appropriations bill. since the budget request was submitted. the administration has in some instances specifically concurred in the decision to continue programs which it proposed terminating. as was the case with public law 9345 extending the authorization for major health programs. i should also like to alert senators to the recommendations of the committee in three particular areas: headstart. education of the handicapped. and the miity access to research careersmarcprogram.
 with the advice and consent of the senate. this fulltime administrator is given egh power to get things accomplished. the bill also creates a bicentennial board. the policymaking arm of the administration. to insure congress coordinate and equal role in the planning of the bicentennial celebration. congressional representatives will be on the board. in addition. the bill provides congressional oversight responsibility by directing the board to report -at least monthly to the congress. when the house passed this measure. i was favorably impressed. especially with its structural reform of the national bicentennial organization. however. i was disappointed that the house failed to authorize the appropriation of adequate sums of money to assist the states in their bicentennial projects. the senate judiciary committee amendments overcome this deficiency in the house bill. as amended by the committee. the bill provides funding to allow the states the maximum opportunity to prepare properly for the bicentennial year. like the house. the judiciary committee thought it unwise to appropriate large sums of money to the states. however. the bill reported out by the judiciary committee does authorize reasonable funding. the bill  provides: first. that the bicentennial administrator may make equal grants of appropriated funds in each fiscal year of  to exceed $45.000 to state bicentennial commissions. and. second. that the administrator out of appropriated funds may carry out a program of grantsinaid on a matching basis to the several states up to $400.000 per state. these appropriated sums. along with the grants of appropriated funds. will enable the states to carry out meaningful. substantive bicentennial programs. again. i congratulate the judiciary committee for reporting out so quickly this excellent bill. i strongly recommend that the senate swiftly pass this important legislation. if we are to experience the type of celebration of our nations birth that we all desire. we can afford more -delays. the committee amendments were agreed to.
as i read the amendment. it requires that the trust fund expenditures of the federal government each fiscal year shall  exceed its revenue. beginning in fiscal 1975. as i understand it. the information that the distinguished senator from th carolina gave to the distinguished senator from idaho was that the intent of this amendment is merely to instruct the president to submit a balanced budget. i do  get that meaning from the language of this amendment. could the senator clarify whether we are merely instructing the president to submit a balanced budget or requiring. as the amendment saysand i think i am reading it correctlythat the trust fund expenditures of the federal government each fiscal year shall  exceed its revenues. which is it.
ial campaigns to be financed entirely from public dollars. i would hope that the rate might go yet higher. for only if we remove those seeking public office from their reliance on large dos. can we then be absolutely certain that those holding public office will  be under an obligation to the individuals and interest groups that contributed to their campaigns. thus. i would like to join my colleagues today in calling for increased usage of the election fund tax checkoff provision. i believe it to be a significant step forward in restoring the integrity of our electoral process.
i think the senator. we have come a long way. we have raised operating subsidies from $280 in fiscal year 1974 to $500 million in fiscal year 1975. we had hoped to get $600 million. but we compromised on more than $500 million in fiscal year 1975 and $560 million in fiscal year 1976. which we hope the secretary of housing and urban development will spend. if he does. we feel that the housing authorities can pay their operating costs and  have the great deficits they have experienced in the past. at the same time. we hope to see an improvement in the quality of living in public housing.
 give serious con- goal. social programs have traditionally enhanced the participation of blacks in americas. ecoy. it is imperative that these programs  be cut. the military budget is  sacrosanct. there must be immediate reduction in wasteful. inefficient military expenditures. the present federal monetary and tax policies serve to perpetuate imbalances in our ecoy. they result in amassing and concentrating most of our ecoic resources in the hands of a powerfui few through special tax shelters. loopholes and massive subsidies for wealthy corporations.
i am very pleased to see the chairman of our subcommittee state on the floor that he is in favor of this approach. i think he did favor this approach in the subcommittee. if my recollection serves me well. i just can understand why hud did  make a budget request. it is a good program. the state agencies have become very effective. would  the senator believe that if we appropriated this money it would be an impetus for hud to move.
. enactment of the supplemental security incomessiprogram marked the beginning of a program of guaranteed annual income for the aged. blind. and disabled. unfortunately. since the federal benefit levels are below the poverty level. the program has provided too little security. because we can in good conscience allow this deplorable situation to continue. i am introducing legislation today which will increase the federal ssi benefit levels. if enacted. this measure will lift approximately 41/2 million people above the poverty level. the bureau of labor statisticsblsmoderate retirement budget for a single person over the age of 65 is $2.370. the annual ssi standard of needcurrently set at $1.752 annually for an individual. provides only 74 percent of that level of income. the federal ssi benefit level also falls short of the bls lower budget level of $1.840. for a couple. aged 65 and over. the lowincome budget is $3.360 and the moderate budget is $4.980. the maximum annual federal ssi payment is $2.628 for a couple or only 78 percent of the lowincome budget and 53 percent of the moderateincome budget. i find it incredible that we have accepted an ssi standard of need lower than the poverty level. to millions of aged. blind. and disabled persons throughout the nation. ssi  represents continued dismal. unrelieved poverty. it is small wonder that we read distressing newspaper reports of the elderly buying cat and dog food to eat. i am pleased that last year we enacted an automatic costofliving escalator clause for ssi recipients. however. such legislation is meaningful only if the basic rate is adequate. it clearly is . my bill would increase the federal income standards under ssi from $146 per month for an individual to $200 per month and from $219 per month for a couple to $300 per monthboth amounts still barely above the minimum level of income. if we truly wish to keep our elderly. blind. and disabled citizensthe people most adversely affected by inflatiot of poverty. we must act immediately to increase the ssi standard of need. by mr. brooke:
. the distinguished chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee has briefly outlined the major characteristics of the fiscal year 1975 foreign assistance appropriations bill. i will confine my brief remarks to several comments on the magnitude of the reductions recommended by the committee. before doing so. i want the distinguished senator from hawaii to k of my great respect for him and my appreciation for the leadership he provides the subcommittee upon which i am privileged to serve as the ranking republican. i also want to thank the staff of the subcommittee. mr. william jordan and the others for their diligent efforts in providing members with detailed. -intelligent analysis of the various programs funded under this bill. the committee report before you is the finest testimony of the quality work of the subcommittee staff. i encourage each of my colleagues to read it carefully if they desire to understand both the opportunities and the problems involved in our foreign aid efforts. it is common practice to analyze appropriations bills in terms of dollar amounts. i would like to depart from the m and use percentages in evaluating what the committee has done. the administrations request for new obligational authority for foreign assistance was approximately $5.9 billion. the amount of funds recommended by the committee is 65 percent of the budget request. a 35percent reduction. it is only 66.3 percent of fiscal year 1974 appropriations for the same programs. a 33.7percent reduction. while i recognize that many perceive the foreign aid bill to be little more than a convenient means to slash the budget. i think all will agree that the cuts recommended by the committee are ample to satisfy that tendency. the house cut 41.2 percent from the budget request. some in this body may desire for various reasons to cut the budget requests to the house level or even lower. however. i am convinced that anyone making an objective examination of the committees recommendations would agree that it makes little sense to do so. indeed. i personally believe that a strong case can be made for increases in such categories as food and nutrition. which we have already increased. assistance for soviet refugees. international organizations and programs. and famine or disaster relief assistance. however. in the main i believe the committees recommendations represent a judicious allocation of our resources for foreign assistance to other countries. and make mistake. the nature of international relations and the position of the united states in the world requires us to make such allocations if we truly desire to maintain our own vital interests and foster greater adherence to our ideals by others. the bill as recommended by the committee indicates congressional priorities for our foreign assistance. first. we desire peace in the middle east. as an indicator of that desire. we have provided over $750 million for programs in that part of the world. second. the congress and the american people place significant emphasis on helping the poorest individuals in the developing world. both our bilateral and multilateral assistance programs have this goal as their primary purpose. third. the committee recommends a significant level of funding for u.n. and related programs. our interests in that organization are well kn to everyone here. finally. i want to call specific attention to the funds provided for assistance to portugal and portuguese territories soon to become independent states. the bill as reported out by the committee recommends $25 million for this program. of this amount $10 million is earmarked for assistance to the territories. specifically. $5 million would be made available for the cape verde islands. a portuguese territory. soon to be independent. situated off the west coast of africa. the other $5 million would provide funds for projects in angola. mozambique. and guineabissau. the remaining $15 million would be available for projects in portugal. the funds for projects in portugal are clearly designed to exhibit to the present portuguese government that the united states is willing to assist in its development efforts so long as conditions in that country make it possible to do so. in this regard. most of us are concerned over the turbulent political situation in portugal. there is the danger that the portuguese government may adopt such a radical posture as to make its continued participation in nato unlikely. this would naturally have serious implications for our own security. given certain base agreements we have with portugal. i am  in a position to predict what the future holds for portugal. but i do believe it is in the interest of the united states to maintain positive relations with the portuguese government if at all possible without sacrificing any of our basic interests. moreover. anyone aware of conditions in portugal will readily understand that the modest aid proposal can be used effectively in improving conditions for the poor of that country. the funds allocated for mozambique. angola. and guineabissau will also indicate to the inhabitants of those areas that as they achieve political independence the united states is desirous of aiding them to also achieve ecoic viability. while $5 million is  a great sum. i believe it will have an important positive impact on our relations with these countries as they gain independence. regarding the cape verde islands. i recognize that very few people in the united states have ever heard of this area. yet many have heard of the sahel region of africa which has suffered tremendously from years of drought. the same drought that affected the sahel also created great hardships for the inhabitants of the cape verde islands. the united states has provided emergency relief for the sahelian countries. we should be equally concerned about the cape verdeans. the $5 million recommended by the committee indicates that we are concerned. on july 5. 1975. the former portuguese colony of the cape verde islands will achieve its independence after a struggle that has continued for almost 20 years. independence will be preceded by elections to be held on june 30. for a national assembly. it is likely that the islands will eventually be associated in some form of political union with the republic of guineabissau. on the mainland of west africa. itself a former portuguese colony  newly independent. this is the country to which most cape verdeans owe their ancestry. nevertheless. because of their geographic isolation. the islands have a set of ecoic and technical problems which are peculiar to themselves. and for which it appears valid to attempt to devise specific strategies.
i think the distinguished senator from virginia has made a worthwhile point. however. i wbuld like to point out. without debating this subject. that even though the money figures. the dollar figures. are relatively the same between the 1974 fiscal appropriation and 1975. inflation has hit foreign aid as it has hit everything else. so actually in constant dollar purchaseing value the committee bill is beneath the 1974 fiscal year appropriations. i am sure the senator from virginia recognizes the inflation that is built into every bill. we tried to keep the bill at the same constant dollar level. as a matter of fact. we are practically at the same dollar level if special assistance to israel is factored out for purposes of comparison. with inflation. i suggest to the senator from virginia that we are actually below the 1974 fiscal year appropriation level.
. at this point i would like to read from our committee report because i believe it most adequately explains what we had in mind for head start: the committee is  convinced that the budget request or the house allowance is sufficient to meet increased costs of local head start projects.  does the budget reflect the higher costs which would result with expanded enrollments of handicapped children. of the increase provided over the house bill. $10.000.000 would be focused on providing a realistic level to help offset the toll inflation has taken on local head start programs. without this additional support. local grantees would undoubtedly have to cut back on (1) the number of children served. and (2) the quality of services provided each child. the remainder. $12.000.000. together with an additional $8.000.000 appropriated by the house. is aimed at providing a more adequate level of support for the 35.000 handicapped children enrolled in head start. estimates of the additional cost of -serving handicapped children range as high as $1.151 per child or nearly twice that of the handicapped child. the department has requested $20.000.000 for head start handicapped in fiscal 1976. the committee. in accepting the house increase and in adding $12.000.000 more. is thus providing the $20.000.000 in this supplemental bill to assure its availability in time for the beginning of the 197576 school year when most of it will be needed. providing these funds at this time will give hew and local grantees sufficient time to carefully plan for their use in the upcoming school year. i am pleased the committee accepted this amendment which i was glad to author. our coninittee also provided $10 million. under aher amendment i sponsored. to initiate a program of providing loans and grants to help poor families meet delinquent utility bills and thus avoid the cut off of service. i view this as "seed" money in the sense that it can generate contributions from local sources to swell the total amount available to meet the problem. i urge the adoption of chapter vi.
. i serve as ranking member of the foreign operations subcommittee of the committee on appropriations. to respond to the question of the senator from new york the answer is yes. $580.400.000 in security supporting assistance is proposed for fiscal year 1976. and the security supporting assistance amount for 1975 is $660 million. as i am sure the distinguished senator from new york ks. so. under the continuing resolution. the lower of these two figures would pre-. vail as the operating rate under which assistance to israel would come.
i certainly can understand the senators concern. it is an important bill. as has been said. and. as senator magnuson said. perhaps the most important appropriations bill we have this year. we would like to get this bill acted upon by both houses and sent to the president for his signaturewe hope for his signature--even though. as the senator has pointed out. it does go considerably above the presidents budget request. though as he also pointed out it is under the congressional budget request.
that is the point i as leading up to. because in that sense it is  the $1.3 billion over the budget that they claim. that can be seen when the millions for impacted aid are taken out. so we really do  feel that we are that much over even the presidents budget request.
. chairman magnuson has expressed our opinion on the supplementals. and i certainly agree with him wholeheartedly. i say to the distinguished senator from maine. who is also the distinguished chairman of the senate budget committee. that we are. very pleased to have his remarks in the record at this time. we think the committee is performing a great service. it appears that they are going to speak on every appropriations bill that is presented to the senate. as to whether it is below or above the budget committees proposals. we are very pleased that we were able to stay below the budget proposal. we appreciate the clear signal that the senator from maine is sending to those who should be listening. we are very grateful.
i thank the majority leader. . i think. in all fairness. that the record ought to show just what is involved in this case. an article which appeared in the raleigh news and observer made certain allegations against the new town of soul city. and that is why this audit was requested. however. hud conducted an investigation of soul city on its own. and i have a letter which was addressed to mr. claude sitton. the editor of the raleigh news and observer. raleigh. n.c.. from a mr. melvin margolies. assistant administrator. office of finance. of huds office of new communities. i am going to read a portion of that letter. because i think it is relevant: dear mr. srrton: at the time mr. pat stith. the reporter responsible for the news and observers recent series on soul city. first appeared at our offices. it was apparent to us that mr. stith did  intend to present a fair and balanced report on the subject. during the course of discussions. mr. stith consistently evidenced disinterest in any and all positive aspects of the soul city project. furthermore. his reporting of the facts and statements was often inaccurate. misleading or unsupported. for example. mr. stith attributed the quote to the general manager that a certain matter could  be researched by the staff because "i just cant take the manpower to do that." in fact. in response to a series of very abrasive comments and questions by mr. stith. the general manager indicated that he did  have the staff to investigate in detail every unsubstantiated allegation of news reporters. but would clearly do so in response to substantive inquiries or concerns by the appropriate persons. furthermore. mr. stiths representations with respect to the relationship of predevelopment costs. the required equity contribution and grants from the office of miity business enterprise of the commerce department were inaccurate. reading from aher part of this letter. and i will put the entire text into the record: unlike most of the other federally sponsored new communities. soul city has  depleted its initial funds but has. in fact. spent less than the projected budget during its first development year. to proceed cautiously at a time of severe slump in the housing industry is a commendable course of action. special escrow disbursement controls which were placed on soul city at the time of its financial closing have insured that the hud guarantee funds would  be expended too rapidly. the entire emphasis of the soul city project has been to bring jobs into warren and vance counties. these counties have been losing jobs for 25 years due to a decline in farming. overall population in the region has been static for this period. the desire to reverse these trends led the state of th carolina. the cities of oxford and henderson. and warren county to support the soul city project. the unique concept of soul city is to provide experience with rural growth centers. this concept has been actively advocated by planners. ecoists and legislators. - on january 31. 1975. the office of the inspector general of hud completed a review of the soul city company. this audit was designed to cover the activities of the soul city company. the hud area office. and the local government agencies as they pertained to the administration of the $10 million of federal grants and loans and the $5 million new community guarantee. the findings of this audit were as follows: "in regard to the accounting and reporting systems used in controlling grant funds. we evidenced mismanagement of grant and loan funds." concluding: it is indeed distressing to me to encounter a reporter and a series of articles that so clearly display preconceived personal bias. undoubtedly. soul city has many problems and difficulties. some of which are included in mr. stiths articles. that the soul city project should experience obstacles and difficulties is  surprising. that the news and observer should devote 17 articles over 8 days discussing the project and  find a single positive point or offer a single rationale for its problems is a matter for its readers to ponder. one need only read the major financial publications to conclude that most largescale real estate developments are presently in serious financial difficulty. it would appear to me that fairness would have required a more balanced attitude. investigation and report. sincerely.
number two. i am certainly. very well aware of the senatorsfight to keep rates low. certainly we are concerned with that. i guess it is just a question . with inflation and higher costs. either this or e at all.
. i certainly support the budget committee and what its chairman has been attempting to do. but it does make it very difficult for us on the appropriations committee to move if we do  k what the budget ceiling is. when we are trying to stay below that budget ceiling. one thing further: even if we stay below the budget ceiling. when you have your functional categories. is it the intent of the budget committee that if we are actually below the budget ceiling overall. but we are over. say. in health. for example. does the budget committee intend to go that far. to get. then. into the various categories. if we are under the overall ceiling for the laborhew appropriations bill. but if we exceed the ceiling on health. would the budget committee therefore be opposed to that.
one point the senator from virginia ought to recognize is that the banks were demanding at all times that before they would stretch out $1.6 billion in bonds. new york city must balance its budget. obviously. new york city was unable to balance its budget prior to that time. they have already agreed to balance the budget by fiscal year 1978. that is part of this agreement. but the banks. even though the city was unable to balance the budget this year as a condition precedent to stretching out the $1.6 billion. went along with a balanced budget by fiscal year 1978. that was taking even a greater risk than they already have. i think that they ought to be given some consideration for that. as well
they could  agree at that time as to what the deficit was. that is certain. subsequently they were able to get together. i had some doubts that they were talking to each other at that time because they did  seem to agree as to what the figure was. i believe after they came to our committee they did get together. they did talk. and they did arrive at some figures which they thought would be sufficient to help the city of new york to avoid default. but since that time. which is what gives me hope. it seems to me that the city of new york and the state have done everything that they could reasonably be expected to. i agree with the distinguished senator from wisconsin that they could just  have increased the sales tax any more. the people of new york would  have been able to stand it. it is going to be very difficult to live in new york city  with what has happened. or to live in new york state. the steps they have taken indicate to me that they are trying to help themselves. i believe that is what the senator from virginia wants to see. and i believe we all want to see that. they got themselves into this mess. and they ought to do everything they possibly can to help themselves out of it. the question is. have they done all they could reasonably be expected to do to help themselves out before the federal government comes in and gives them assistance. personally. i have resolved that question in favor of new york. that they have done everything that they could reasonably have been expected to do. i still believe. and i do  k if the senator from virginia was in the chamber when i had the colloquy with the senator from illis . the bill which the senate banking committee initially voted out. which i voted against. was based a lot on hope and expectation which may or may  have been realized. i think since that time we do have positive evidence of city. state. and private sector participation. which i think should be a condition precedent to the federal government giving any assistance to the city of new york. i think we have that . i am just trying to determine what the senators fears are. do we have any evidence. or does the senator from virginia have any evidence or data. which would indicate that new york would  be in a position to repay the federal government.
 but i do think the chairman makes a valid point when he indicates that the moratorium. of course. accounts for that difference of $1.6 billion. i k the senator from virginia is somewhat concerned that we have this variance. that we came out with a bill from the senate banking committee for $4 billion and  we are talking about considerably less. obviously. the question is a very valid question. if they needed $4 billion then. how can they do with considerably less . i think the explanation for the $4 billion. at least. is that the moratorium of $1.6 billion which the president was able to get into the proposal accounts for part of the difference. the remainder is accounted for by new tax revenues. a voluntary stretching out of debt by private eholders. and purchase of debt by pension funds. the question still in the mind of the senator from virginia obviously is: is this going to be egh. if it is  going to be egh. will they be kking on the door next year or the year after that. how much are we in for and for how long are we in for it.
i thank the senator. i was concerned. because if new york city could  sell its bonds. there was some reason to expect that buyers would  be found for these debt certificates without a guarantee. thus. some federal exposure would in all likelihood have been required even if default occurred. but i do  feel that other cities will come rushing in. if they are compelled to do all of the things which new york city has been compelled to do. in order to get this type assistance. i do  think other cities or legislative bodies are going to be anxious to levy such stiff taxes upon their citizens as did the state of new york or the city of new york. for that matter. so i do  think the great fear that "we have opened up the door and  we are going to have 15 or 20 cities and four or five states around the country running in"-i just do  think that is going to happen. if i did. i would certainly agree with the senator from virginia that this is probably something we ought  to be doing. i still do  like to see us going down that road. but i still do  k what the options are. i do  think the senator from wisconsin ks what the options are. and i do  think the senator from virginia has given us what options we have. i think we are making the best of a bad situation. one likes it or wants it. the people of new york do . and the people of massachusetts do . but we have to deal with things as they are. rather than what we would like to have them be.
first of all. if the senator will permit. i wish to clarify the statement i made earlier. to which the senator from oklahoma referred. i stated. in response to the senator from virginia. that it is my opinion that we will  have a deluge of cities running in for federal assistance as a result of favorable action that. hopefully. the senate will take and which the house has already taken. on this bill. my reason for saying that was that the criteria which are established in the plan that was submitted. and that the president agreed to. are criteria which cities across the nation are  going to want to have to meet. i still believe that to be true. i do  believe cities want to give up some of their sovereignty. i do  think they want to impose new taxes as new york city has been compelled to do. i think that many of the other conditions in the new york plani shall  reiterate them. i have mentioned them several times todayare so stringent that we will  find cities eager to avail themselves of this kind of federal assistance. i wonder. myself. what would happen if a city in oklahoma found itself in a similar crisis. obviously. it would  be of this magnitude. we would  be talking about the same dollar volume. because the cities in oklahoma. obviously. are much smaller than new york city. in fact. there is such city in oklahoma. but if a city in oklahoma found itself in a fiscal crisis. due to some mismanagementi k this is something far beyond the imagination of the senator from oklahoma. but just for purposes of debate. if such a city found itself in that condition and came to the federal government to get assistance. as did the city of new york. it would appear to me that the first thing that would be required of that city would be that the state of oklahoma help that city out. as i understand what the senator from oklahoma has said. they have a constitutional prohibition against the state of oklahoma helping that city out of its financial crisis. so the condition precedent. it seems to me. on the federal level. that would go the route we are going under this law. would be for a constitutional amendment by the state of oklahoma so that the state of oklahoma could first help that city to the best of its ability before it could qualify for federal assistance.
let me get to that. i am sorry. i was answering the first part of the question. and certainly the senator is entitled to an answer. i wish i could. obviously. i can. but i wish i could say to the senator from oklahoma and to all my colleagues that i k specifically that steps 1. 2. 3. and 4 will lead to a balanced budget for the city of new york in 1978. i can say that. i do  think anyone can say that. i can even say that my own city of boston or my own state of massachusetts will have a balanced budget next year or the year after that. i do  think that the senator from oklahoma. even with his constitutional amendment. can say that they will have a balanced budget in all the cities and towns in the state of oklahoma. i just do  believe we can say that. what i do say to the senator from oklahoma is this: i do believe that we have exacted all that we can reasonably exact from the city. from the state. from the financial community. from the labor unions. and from all in interest in order to put the city of new york on a sound financial basis and to arrive at a balanced budget by the year 1978. i can go back over all the things. the taxes that have been passed. and list the litany of criteria which the city. the state. and the private sector are meeting. but i do  believe that would satisfy the senator from oklahoma.
i hope. again. that the senator is wrong. that the money that is in this bill will be sufficient to do the job. i am sure the senator hopes as well that it will be sufficient to do the job. that the city will  have to come back to us once. twice. or several times prior to going into bankruptcy. because this will be sufficient to get them on their way and to balance their budget by 1978. i want to assure the senator that if any city in his state gets into a similar financial crisis. and i certainly hope and pray it will . and meets the criteria that the city of new york has had to meet. they should be able to get the same consideration the city of new york got.
without repeating the litany of what has been required of new york city. and new york state. and the private sector. much of which already has been done. obviously. other than cutting back on expenditures the only action which can be taken to balance the budget is increasing of revenues and that is exactly what the city of new york is doing. that is exactly what the state of new york is doing. but i can understand why the senator is so concerned about the balancing of the budget in 1977 insofar as the federal government is concerned. i repeat. that the pension funds will have to supply the money so that new york can operate on an unbalanced budget for aher year. so where is the injury to the federal government. we will be paid at the end of that year with approximately 8 percent interest. they have said that they will be able to balance that budget by 1978the figures have been given to the senator by the chairman of the banking committee and indicate what their deficit will be in 1977. and that they will be zero in 1978. that is what the american people want. the senator from louisiana has given us the statistics from the most recent poll. which is practically right on line with the vote in the senate. i think he said 69 percent of the american people favor this. seventy senators voted today for cloture. that is some indication that the u.s. senate is reading what the american people want. but when the american people say. "we want to balance the budget." they probably do  k that you can say. "yes. we are going to balance the budget today." we do  want just a paper balanced budget. we want to be sure that we have an honest balanced budget according to sound accounting principles.
. i would just like to point out to the senator from alaska that this costbenefit ratio is obtained by using a 33/4 percent borrowing rate. without any builtin inflation at all. and  providing for any profit.
i ask the senator whether he ks if this tax credit has been effective. as the senator may remember. i made a proposal that we have a $2.000 credit which would be an incentive for homebuyers to buy new homes but that was $2.000 that would have been given to the homebuyer at the time of purchase of a new home as incentive for that buyer to go out and purchase a new home. it was essentially a downpayment assistance program. the committee on finance came out with a $2.000 tax credit program which was different from the program i proposed. but i voted for it. we had the secretary of hud before the committee on banking. housing and urban affairs in an oversight hearing. and we asked the secretary. in fact. i asked her myself. whether the tax credit program had been effective. and. as i recall. her testimony was that it had been of limited effect. i have had some correspondence with the secretary on this subject. and i would ask unanimous consent that this correspondence be printed in the record at this point.
the information indicates that this tax credit has  been effective. the senator from indiana says he has data from the homebuilders to the effect that it is responsible for 43 percent of new housing construction. as i understand it. as i said. we had the secretary of hud at an oversight hearing. and she said that it had limited effect. had this tax credit been a refundable tax creditand i urged that upon the chairman of the committee on finance when we passed this provisionit may have been effective. because it would have put money into the hands of the prospective new home purchaser at the time he bought his home rather than at the end of the tax year. i do  like to see us extend legislation which is ineffective. i am  sure that we are going to stimulate much new housing production by extending this tax credit. i want to be sure of that. because many of us are in doubt as to how to vote on this extension. if. in fact. this has worked. if it has been effective. then there might be a need to extend it for 6 months. the housing industry is still in bad shape. if it has  worked. if it is  effective. if it is  doing the job. then i think we are spending money uselessly. i would like the senator from indiana to address himself to that issue. if he will.
. funds provided in this conference report are necessary to provide for many major needed programs but in particular to support increased pay costs. increases due to inflation and other urgent matters that can be delayed until the next supplemental appropriations bill or until fiscal year 1977. i urge the adoption of the conference report.
 has proposed in his budget $3.248 billion for the program. i would like to give assurance to the senator from new york and the senator from texas that. as we see it. we are adopting this on the supposition that there will be deficiency.
. i am very pleased that the distinguished chairman of the senate budget committee has explained that when the administration says that we are over the budget. we are talking about the administrations budget. that it reflects the administrations priorities and  our priorities. and that they conceivably and understandably could be quite different. can the distinguished chairman inform us again as to how our bill for $36 billion plus compares both as to budget authority and outlays with the congressional budget.
. the importance of energy conservation and the benefits of insulation and heating equipment upgrading are by  well kn to all of us who are dedicated to producing a realistic national energy conservation policy. therefore. i will introduce for the record. but will  go over again. a fact sheet showing how the 35 million american homes which are inadequately insulated could save the equivalent of 130 million barrels of oil a year through insulation and how the 2 million homes whose heating systems need marginal upgrading through retrofit could eventually save the equivalent of 9 million barrels of oil a year. these facts are  in dispute. a number of my colleagues have asked me to review for them here the revenue loss impact of this measure. studies prepared by the joint committee on taxation for the house ways and means committee estimate that the calendar year revenue loss for the insulation portion of the bill will be $260 million per year. however. e of this loss will occur during 1976. and thus the budget committee estimates for the years revenues are  affected. the reason is that this is. of course. a tax credit.  a deduction. and will only show up in 1977 as taxpayers file their returns. a further question has been raised regarding the revenue impact of the provision i added to the housepassed measure that would make home heating system retrofitting expenditures also eligible for the tax credit. i have worked with the home heating system industry to get the most conservative and the most generous estimates of revenue losses for the retrofit portion of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that the letter from the national oil fuel institute which details the assumptions and methods used to arrive at these figures be printed in the record following my remarks.
 believed then. and still believes. that the insulation tax credit is needed  by homeowners. particularly in the colder regions of our country. the house of representatives. holding the same conviction. passed h.r. 6860. which contains the insulation tax credit for residences. in june 1975 the federal energy administration (pea) estimates that more than 18 million single family homes in the united states are inadequately insulated. improved insulation can save the homeowner more than 20 percent in heating and cooling costs. and provide protection from rising prices for all fuels. if the insulation tax credit becomes law. many more americans will choose to insulate their homes. as a result. the nation could save the equivalent of 130.000 barrels of oil per day by 1978. according to recent fea estimates. i hope this answers your question as to the administrations position with respect to the proposed home insulation tax credit. i appreciate your continued support of this proposal. sincerely.
i thank the distinguished senator from rhode island for his support. and i am pleased to have him as a cosponsor of this proposed legislation. . as i have stated. i have talked this matter over with my good friend the senator from louisiana . the chairman of the finance committee. i am well aware of the many demands made on the finance committee. and the problems they face. i have served on that committee. and i am sympathetic with them. on the other hand. this is important legislation. i did bring it up last year. and we hoped to have hearings in january. here we are . in march. i was hopeful that the senator would make a commitment to bring this matter up as soon as possible. otherwise. i stated last year i would be forced to put it on the first vehicle that came along. and the first vehicle that came along happened to be the debt ceiling bill. i am cognizant that we need to pass the debt ceiling bill. and i am  going to push my amendment. though i candidly say i think we have sufficient votes to pass it. i k that the chairman does  want to go to conference with it because he had a clean bill from the house. and i want to be a team player and go along with that. i respect him. and i k that when he gives his word he means it. i am hopeful we can get early action on this legislation. because i believe it is so vitally important to this country. exhinrt 1 senator edward w. brooke. old senate office building. washington. d.c. dear senator brooke: pursuant to your request. the national oil fuel institute has provided some rough figures upon which we have estimated the revenue loss that could be expected in connection with your amendment. the home heating systems improvement act of 1975. the estimates are very rough because there is way to calculate with any precision the ability of the ndustry to provide all of the qualified retrofit components that could be installed. nevertheless. the calculations represent the most optimistic circumstances within the range of what can be considered realistic. since you need a best estimate as to the maximum federal exposure. the figures provided below assume that every homeowner likely to benefit from retrofit installations will take full benefit of the tax credit. case i represents the lowest estimate of the maximum federal exposure for the fiscal years indicated. case ii represents the highest estimate of the maximum federal exposure for the fiscal years indicated. case i maximum expected retrofit installation for: fiscal 1976 (6 months). 50.000 homes. fiscal 1977. 100.000 homes. fiscal 1978. 150.000 homes. maximum expected retrofit expenditures: $150 per home. $150.00. 30% tax credit. $45.00. federal exposure for fiscal 1976 (6 months). 50.000x$45. $2.25 million. federal exposure for fiscal 1977. 100.ooox $45. $4.5 million. federal exposure for fiscal 1978. 150.000x $45. $6.75 million. case ii maximum expected retrofit installation for: fiscal 1976 (6 months). 100.000 homes. fiscal 1977. 150.000 homes. fiscal 1978. 200.000 homes. maximum expected retrofit expenditures: $250 per home. $250.00. 30% tax credit. $75.00. federal exposure for fiscal 1976 (6 months. 100.000x$75. $7.5 million. federal exposure for fiscal 1977. 150.o0ox $75. $11.25 million. feceral exposure for fiscal 1978. 200.000x $75. $15 million. as far as we k. there are figures available to identify with precision the number of homeowners that will respond to the tax credit incentive. in testimony before the senate commerce committee. the pea indicated that they had information at all. nevertheless. the range presented by case i and case ii should provide an approximate idea of the federal revenue impact. with best regards. i am. sincerely yours. c. alexander hxwes. jr.
and what we are doing is taking them out of the second supplemental and putting them in an urgent supplemental because it is so urgent. we have the swine flu vaccine. plus the summer youth jobs. the public service jobs and jobs for the elderly in here.
 i do  ask the senator to do that under the circumstances of our fiscal restraint. i do think it is important for us to pass this amendment because there is such a crying need for it. there has been such disaster that i do  k of any place in the world at the present time that has undergone more than the people of leba. and i commend the distinguished senator for proposing this amendment. we are very pleased to accept it.
. over the last few years there has been a good deal of talk about "tax reform" and it seems that every year legislation which is characterized as "reform" legislation is proposed either by the administration or members of congress. of course. any talk about tax reform presumes an underlying conception of the proper distribution of the burden of paying for the cost of government. dr. martin s. feldstein of harvard university has written a thoughtful article which provides an interesting theoretical framework on which to build a tax reform program. and i think that his ideas deserve consideration. i ask unanimous consent that dr. feldsteins article be printed in the record following my remarks.
. what dr. feldstein proposes is a rethinking of the purpose and method of taxation. obviously. any decision to embark on the course suggested by feldstein would require considerable discussion and education of the public. however. as the senate proceeds to the consideration of aher tax bill. with the attendant deadline pressures which usually accompany such legislation. it might be worthwhile to pause to reconsider the underlying ecoic theory of our tax system. i commend dr. feldsteins article to my colleagues for their consideration. exhibit 1 a nrw route to reforms: taxing
reserving the right to object. . if the senator from maine meant what he just said. as i heard him. why does he  withdraw his amendment and let us proceed with the finance bill as the senator from alaska has suggested. i think that is the best way to proceed. and then we would all be able to work as best we could on a good tax bill. if he withdraws his muskie amendment we can go on title by title as we intended to start with the bill.
 when he provided a substantial increase for the foundations fiscal year 1977 budget for basic research. late in the budget preparation process. after it was determined that the overall federal budget for fiscal year 1977 at that time included inadequate support for basic research. it is important that the congress also recognizes this balancing role of the national science foundation in the support of the nations basic research efforts. the recommended action of the senate appropriations committee is extremely important especially in view of the actions of the house which would reduce nsfs research funding by more than $50 million below the budget request. by giving an overwhelming approval to the senate version of the foundations appropriation bill. we can take an important step in arriving at the needed level of funding for the nsf in fiscal year 1977. basic research and our universities and colleges all across america will be affected by the action we take on this bill. and positive action by the senate will give u.s. science a vote of confidence at this crucial time. i strongly urge the support of all my colleagues in the senate to approve the proposed appropriation for the national science foundation.
. at last we have the opportunity to give final congressional approval to the foreign assistance appropriations act for fiscal year 1976. it is frustrating to be doing so 2 days before the end of the fiscal year. especially when the conference on the bill was completed on april 2. 1976. the reasons for the delay are. by . well kn. hopefully. they will  recur. the recommendations of the conferees. in the main. provide adequate funding for our many foreign assistance activities in fiscal year 1976 and the transition quarter. more than $426 million is provided for efforts designed to increase food production and nutritional levels in the developing world. $146 million is provided for health and family planning activities. and $175 million is made available for the united nations and other international organizations. the security supporting assistance program is funded for fiscal year 1976 at a level of $1.689 billion. a level sufficient to fund the middle east programs as well as various other activities. we have also provided $15 million for assistance in resettling refugees from the soviet union and eastern europe. this continues our support of those soviet jews who have risked so much to gain control over their own destinies. also. $25 million has been provided for assisting cypriot refugees. sufficient funding has also been provided cxxii- 1340part 17 for the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank. i will vote for the conference report because it is a good bill when looked at in its totality. however. there are two areas where i disagree with the recommendations. first. i believe the congress is mistaken in providing only $320 million for the international development association rather than the $375 million requested and provided by the senate version of the bill. this reduction in our contribution to the international financial institution that concentrates its activities on helping the least developed of the worlds countries contradicts our oftrepeated commitment to accelerating our efforts to help the poorest of the poor. moreover. the recommended action may lead to a lessening of commitment by other dos to assume a greater portion of the aid burden than they have done heretofore. i hope that we will  repeat this mistake as we consider the fiscal year 1977 foreign assistance appropriations in the next few weeks. the second area of disagreement. and the one most distressing to me. is the transition quarter funding for the middle east. the senate version of the bill recommended that our middle east program in the transition quarter should be funded as follows: israel-$175.0 million in security supporting assistance and $206.25 million ($375 m prog.) in foreign military credit sales. egypt-$173.7 million in security supporting assistance. jordan-$18.1 million in security supporting assistance. syria-$20.0 million in security supporting assistance. the conference report. as amended by house action this week. reduces the program for three of these countries. the greatest reduction falls upon our ally. israel. in the conference report only $75 million is provided in security supporting assistance and only $110 million in new obligational authority for military credits is provided for israel. allowing a total fms program of $200 million. thus. from a senate recommended total program level for security supporting assistance and military credits of $550 million for israel. the conference report recommends a total program of $275 million for israel in the transition quarter. a 50percent reduction below the senate recommendation. this compares to a 42percent reduction for egypt. a 232percent increase for jordan and a 25 percent decrease for syria. while certain factors justify the altered amount for jordan. i do  believe that a 50percent reduction in the original senate recommendation for israel is justified. israel is currently operating under stringent ecoic constraints created. in great part. by the continued state of war with her arab neighbors. israel fervently desires to bring the state of war to an end. we all hope and pray that peace will come. but. until that happens. israel has choice but to maintain a high degree of military preparedness in order to maintain a credible deterrent/ defense capability. this is an extremely costly operation that depends for its integrity. to a great degree. on continued u.s. willingness to provide indispensable assistance. and it is an operation that has created great pressures on the civilian sectors of the israeli ecoy. the gravity of the shortterm ecoic outlook for israel is reflected in various statistical indexes. unemployment is estimated at 4.8 percent for 1976. up from the 3.2 percent of the previous year. the forecast for inflation in 1976 is 34 percent. up from the 23.5 percent of the previous year. there has been an estimated 2percent decline in real salaries in each of the past 2 years. the current accounts deficit for 1976 may run in the area of $3.6 billion. and the national foreign debt has risen from $4.1 billion in 1972 to an estimated $9 billion for 1976. while these various ecoic indicators are alarming. i believe that the israeli ecoy. given peace. would be sufficiently resilient to overcome shortterm difficulties and continue its longterm productivity. for this to occur. it is crucial that israel receive adequate assistance in the short term to limit the -possibility of military inadequacy or ecoic chaos. it has only one place to turn for such assistance. the united states. and i believe that the american people. by a great majority. are prepared to continue to shoulder this assistance burden as they are the ones placed upon them by our justified efforts to improve relations with the arab world. given the ecoic problems faced by israel. the amounts provided for that country in the transition quarter may be insufficient. nevertheless. i will vote for this conference report in the hope that in fiscal year 1977 funding levels for israel as well as other countries in the middle east will be sufficient to reflect our interests in maintaining the military. ecoic. and political equilibrium in the area needed to encourage progress toward a just resolution of the conflict.
s request of $34 million for the international narcotics control program. this is an area where the wellbeing of literally millions of americans depends on a continued crusade against those in the world who would subject others to the slavery of drug addiction. fifth. the committees recommendation of $1.736 billion for security supporting assistance makes ample provision for funding of the middle east program: $735 million is provided to israel. $700 million is allocated to egypt. $70 million is provided to jordan. and $80 million is made available to egypt. the assistance provided for middle east countries is crucial to efforts to maintain the ecoic and political equilibrium needed to encourage progress toward a just resolution of the longstanding conflict in that area. i want to call particular attention to the funds made available for israel. that country is currently operating under stringent ecoic constraints. until peace comes to that area of the world. a condition that all individuals of good will fervently desire for israeli and arab alike. israel will need firm and continuous support from the united states. israel has choice but to maintain a high degree of military preparedness as a means of insuring a credible deterrent/ defense capability. such military preparedness is an extremely costly undertaking that depends for its success. to a great degree. on continued u.s. assistance. and it is an undertaking that has created great pressures on the civilian sector of the israeli ecoy. the moneys we have recommended for israel under security supporting assistance will help to keep those pressures within acceptable limits. i believe there can be little question regarding the gravity of the shortterm ecoic troubles besetting israel. unemployment has risen to an estimated 4.2 percent in 1976. compared to 3.2 percent in the previous year. inflation for the current year is running at an annual rate of 34 percent. an increase of approximately 10 percent over 1975 levels. the current accounts deficit for 1976 will be an estimated $3.6 billion. and the national foreign debt has risen from $4.1 billion in 1972 to an estimated $9 billion in 1976. given these factors. the committee recommendation of $735 million for israel is fully justified. other countries in the middle east are also suffering from ecoic ill. the committee has recommended generous levels of assistance for such countries as egypt and jordan. but there is one reality to keep in mind. the arab countries have elsewhere to turn for assistance in meeting their ecoic shortfalls. the oilrich arab states have exhibited an increasing willingness to help their less fortunate arab neighbors. israel. on the other hand. has only one place to turn for assistance. the united states. i. for one. believe that the american people. by a great majority. have intention of lessening their interest and concern for israel. the amount we have recommended for israel. both under security supporting assistance and the foreign military sales program. is a strong expression of that continued concern. sixth. for the peace corps we recommend $81 million. an increase over the budget request of approximately $13.8 million. it should be ed that the $81 million level is slightly less than the fiscal year 1976 appropriation. i was happy to join with senator hatfield in recommending an additional $10 million for the peace corps over the house level of $71 million to the committee on appropriations. this additional $10 million will permit significant increases in the number of volunteers in the field as well as in the field support provided for all volunteers. seventh. the committee also recommends $15 million for assistance to refugees from the soviet union and other comniunist countries in eastern europe. this money will contribute to the material resettlement of individuals who have risked everything for the right to exercise a greater degree of control over their own destiny. perhaps more important. however. is the fact that the appropriation of these funds will serve ice to moscow that the united states has intention of reducing its support of the principle of free emigration for those who find the shackles of communist society unbearable. eighth. the committee also recommends $25 million to aid individuals who still suffer as a result of the cyprus crisis. this continues a program entered into several years ago by the united states to try to alleviate some of the hardships caused by the tearing asunder of the peace of that island country. even as we hope and pray that a resolution of that continuing crisis will soon occur. we must soberly recognize that the needs of the displaced peoples continue to be great. for both humanitarian and political reasons. i am convinced we should  reduce our efforts to help the cypriots at this time. ninth. the committee also recommends the appropriation of $375 million for the international development association. the budget request was for $430 million. the $375 million level is the minimum we should provide. to reduce our contribution further to the international financial institution that concentrates its activities on helping the least developed of the worlds countries would contradict our oftrepeated commitment to accelerating our efforts to help the poorest of the poor. moreover. acceptance of the house level of $320 million could lead to a lessening of commitment by other dos to assume a greater portion of the aid burden than they have done heretofore. we should  repeat our mistake of fiscal year 1976 of agreeing to a level of $320 million for ida. tenth. finally. the committee has agreed to my amendment providing for a $10 million contribution to the african development fund. this $10 million. coupled with the $5 million appropriated in the most recent supplemental is a major expression of u.s. desire to assist the african nations in making their regional development bank a success. there are many other important funding initiatives in this bill but time is  available to mention all of them. therefore. in closing let me reiterate my belief that this bill can justifiably be termed the best appropriations measure on foreign assistance that has been brought before the senate in many years. it strikes the proper balance between fiscal restraint and judicious allocation of our resources to meet foreign assistance priorities. it is supportive of our national interests and ideals. i am confident that it will elicit the support of the vast majority of my colleagues.
i think it is well to point out that most of aid recipients are very poor developing countries which can afford to repay loans on par terms. and by imposing hard loan terms on them. we really are going to increase their debt servicing requirements and jeopardize our opportunities for getting repaid. so it might be selfdefeating if it would turn out to be grants rather than loans. if we give hard terms rather than these relatively soft terms. as contained in the committees bill.
but most important. the credit will help acquaint the oil and gas heat consumers with the availability of retrofit devices and thus help start up the demand for the savings this kind of item can provide. the joint committee on taxation has estimated the revenue losses to be: million in transition ------------------------- $2 in fiscal year 1977 -------------------- 32 in fiscal year 1978 --------------------66 in fiscal year 1979 -------------------- 56 total -------------------------156 i believe these are responsible and realistic figures. furthermore. i believe we can and must afford them. the congress is about to enact a separate conservation program totalling $575 million in authority. of this. $200 million will demonstrate new ways of conserving energ in homes. but  one penny has been designated for expanding the utilization of these existing techogies where we already k they can be effective. certainly an average of $50 million a year is a modest sum for this addition to our conservation tools. especially when compared to the $1.5 billion we plan to spend for the new conservation and the insulation tax credit combined. and. if we take into account the additional revenue losses for the proposed heat pump and solar tax credits. this additional expenditure virtually disappears. the 17.2 million barrels of potential btus saved every year after we have retrofitted most systems will be with us and will grow as the industry develops. i must add that i share with several of my colleagues a general distaste for using the tax system to establish national priorities and programs. i. too. would prefer to do everything by direct subsidy. but our best efforts this summer have  brought us near to achieving a loopholefree tax package. and i believe this provision offers a sound way to let the ordinary taxpaying family benefit from the system just as does the insulation credit. for once. we have a measure which benefits  a multinational corporation or special interest group. but rather. almost every homeowner with an older oil or gas furnace. and we can. as a result. expect the substantial energy savings which must be a primary national goal.
i just want to make it crystal clear to the distinguished chairman of the committee that i am for revenue sharing. i do  want to do anything in any way to hurt revenue sharing. i would like to see it continued. i would like to see its funding increased. and i want to see this bill passed. i think that is also true of the distinguished senator from alaska who has proposed these amendments. as i understand it. we are  trying to write new law. all we are trying to do is to track the existing law in this bill. the house passed this measure with discrimination provisions for the aged and the handicapped and a discrimination provision with respect to religion. i do  k whether they included attorneys fees or . but certainly they had the other provisions in the language of the bill. it is my understanding that the finance committee deleted these sections. and that is why we do  have it before the senate at the present time. but let me again emphasize that the provisions passed by the house and contained in our amendments restate the existing law. why does the senator feel that we have any more difficulty with having antidiscrimination language in the revenuesharing bill than in any other legislation that we have or have had before congress.
i would justlike to say to the distinguished chairman of the committee. as i prefaced my earlier remarks. i am a strong supporter of revenue sharing. i think most of us in the senate are strong supporters. but i must commend the senator from alaska for proposing these amendments. they are sound. they merely make revenue sharing keep pace with antidiscrimination law in this country. it is  doing any more. it is  extending it. it is including it. and it ought to be included. the senator said himself that the legislation includes the civil rights act. fine. but the senate and the congress in its wisdom adopted the rehabilitation act in 1973. as i have said. and the age discrimination act in 1975. why do we  . since we have passed these very important. very necessary. and very useful pieces of legislation. make revenuesharing funds subject to them as well as any other funds. i just can see any justification for leaving revenue sharing out. apparently. the house did  see any such justification. i can understand why the finance committee deleted this from the bill that came before the senate. i hope the senator from alaskas amendments are adopted. i think if they are . it puts us far back. really. in antidiscrimination law. it would be an injustice to the disabled in this country. it would be an injustice to the aged in this country. and it would be an injustice generally insofar as this important money is concerned. so i hope the senators amendments will be adopted.
i want to reassure the senator that first of all. when we restrict the counsel fees to the prevailing parties we really prevent frivolous suits. if the individual brings a frivolous suit that individual may be called upon to pay the counsel fees and the court costs themselves. so i think we need  fear frivolous suits. the senator has said consistently: why subject these local governments to this. my response is: why should we  subject local governments to it. we have antidiscrimination laws. we do  want discrimination by private concerns. who best should be the ones  to discriminate and to set the example in this country than the government itself. if anybody should be called upon for discrimination it ought to be the government: the federal government. the state government. the county government. and the local government. it seems to me we can justify in any hianner  requiring that federal funds be used in a discriminatory way. whether it applies to national origin. race. religion. age. sex. color. or disability. that is all we are trying to do. we have passed those laws. thank god. we have passed those laws. all we are saying in these amendments is that it ought to apply to revenue sharing as well. how can we justify saying. "all right. we are going to give you federal government money but you do  have to abide by the law because you are the government." how can we justify that. there is justification for it whatsoever. i just want to assure the distinguished senator from louisiana that he has fear about frivolous suits or counsel fees because counsel fees have worked very well without frivolous suits. as i have said before. in employment. in education. and also in housing. i say to the senator that we need it in this revenue sharing more than any place else. because this is a coverall. these funds are used for a variety of purposes. there should be discrimination in the use of these funds
the language has beei modified. i do  k whether thi senator from connecticut has this nev language. the language of the hous( measure was  satisfactory where i referred to that provision. the language we have  is: on page 47. line 25. immediately after the period add the following: "any prohibitior against discrimination on the basis of religionand these are the key wordsor any exemption from such prohibition. as provided in the civil rights act . . . shall also apply to any revenue sharing program or activity. the cases that the senator names are exemptions under that act. existing exemptions under that act.
there were many organizations that were upset. as the senator has mentioned. so in an effort to correct that. because he did  want to exclude these groups from federal funds. the senator from alaska amended this language so we say: "any prohibition against discrimination on the basis of religion. or any exemption from such prohibition. as provided in the civil rights act of 1964 of title viii of the civil rights act of 1968 shall also apply to any such revenue sharing program of activity." that is very clear language. the senator. has corrected the mistake of the house of representatives. i think the house of representatives is well aware of it and will appreciate that correction. but there is need for an interpretation of this specific language. it merely closes a loophole that was opened by the house of representatives in the language of their bill. that is all. of course. it is very small thing. and i reassure my friends from delaware that even though lawyers might question it maybe they just want some time for the next subject we are talking about. namely. counsel fees.
. even the conference agreement represents a reduction of more than a halfbillion dollars from the level of funding provided by the senate. moreover. the level of funding has beenand continues to bewell within the budget ceilings established by congress. those budget ceilings were arrived at only after long study and careful consideration.
. to answer my distinguished colleague from new hampshire. whom i see on his feet. this is an amendment to clear an inequitable result brought about by the recent passage of section 209 of the tax reform act of briefly. that section will change the rules for allocating basis in the matter of player contracts. tax equity mandates that an extension of the effective date of this provision occur in this unique situation. it applies only to one individual that was hurt by it. i have discussed this with the distinguished chairman of the committee on finance and he has agreed to take it.
. in recent years it has become increasingly apparent that a large segment of the american people has lost confidence in congress as an institution. indeed. according to one national survey taken last year. an appallingly low 9 percent of those polled gave congress a favorable rating. the causes for public disenchantment are many. but. in my judgment. a principal cause is the widespread belief that congress has been unable or unwilling to investigate and. if necessary. discipline. those members of congress who have been accused of illegal or unethical conduct. for the truth is that while congress is always more than eager to investigate members of the executive branch or the activities of the business community. it has been remiss in its constitutional responsibility to tidy up its own houses. in the wake of a number of congressional scandals in the mid1960s. the senate and the house of representatives set up their respective ethics committees. it was a good idea then. and it still is. but the establishment of the ethics committees was meant to be only a start. unfortunately. neither the senate  the house has learned the lessons of the past decade and consequently. little has been done to strengthen those committees. the times demand that we respond  to the legitimate criticisms that have been leveled at our congressional disciplinary procedures. but a perfunctory response will  suffice. we must demonstrate to the american people our resolve.  just our rhetoric. to accomplish comprehensive reform. just as the enactment of the budget reform act in the last congress demonstrated our commitment to fiscal discipline. we must  demonstrate our commitment to ethical discipline. to help accomplish this end. i am introducing today a package of reform proposals. this legislation will have three principal purposes. first. and perhaps most important. it would substantially amend the present procedural rules of the senate ethics committee. among other things the bill would limit membership on the committee to one term and provide a balance between veterans and younger members. broaden the jurisdiction of the committee. improve the complaint procedures. mandate thorough investigations and reports on the results of these investigations. and provide for additional staff. including. when necessary. the appointment of independent outside counsel. this bill will give the justice department more time to investigate and prosecute violations of the election campaign law. in light of the most recent revelations regarding possible congressional misconduct and the need to prevent future problems. i hope that the 95th congress will address these issues promptly and thoroughly. indeed. i hope that the congress accords this type of legislation the highest priority. for. by demonstrating that it is willing and able to undertake such genuine fundamental reform. congress will be well on the way to regaining the trust and confidence of the american people.
the senator will recognize that the official conduct committee. under the distinguished leadership of senator nelson and senator thurmond. addressed itself to this question specifically. they debated it. and they voted unanimously upon it. i refer the senator to the report of the special committee on official conduct on page 11. the committee says: the committee recognizes further that certain expenditures related to official duties inevitably will fall into a "gray area." that is. certain expenditures will  be eligible for reimbursement by the senate and. at the same time. will  be directly related to a campaign for election to public office. the committee provides. therefore. in rule xlvi. that funds derived from a political committee (fully disclosed and regulated under the federal elections campaign act) may be used to defray expenses incurred by a member in connection with his official duties. in addition. to deal with potential tax problenis mentioned earlier. the committee recommends that the rules committee and the appropriations committee. in consultation with the finance committee. review provisions of the internal revenue code and related regulations regarding funds used to defray the ordinary and necessary expenses of members. and report recommendations to the senate within 120 days. does this  take care of what the senator from illis is trying to do. i think the committee has done a very sound and reasonable job in arriving at this decision because the senator himself agrees that there is a very difficult gray area. here we are talking about fully disclosed funds. so we are  talking about a slush fund. as the senator from illis has mentioned. and i k what he means by a slush fund. we are  talking about a slush fund. if we were talking about a slush fund. i would personally have problem with this. but we are  talking about a slush fund. we are talking about a duly organized and registered committees fully disclosed income and expenditure. why then can that committee provide expenses for things which should  be paid for by the taxpayer. that is the specific question that i put to the distinguished senator from illis.
the senator is quite correct that a very limited survey was taken. i do  have the figures. but i will accept the senators figure of $7.5 million. that is relatively little. when we consider that available is some $145 million which can be utilized by those projects that concern the senator. i do  k about the difference in the information we are receiving. but we have received within the last few minutes. as i understand it. irom dr. ed martin of the health services administration. information that they do  need additional funds to maintain the service levels under the grants awarded and that they do have additional funds for family planning elsewhere in the hew budget. i assure the senator that his concern about funding those projects is my concern. and many of us are concerned about it. and they will be funded. i do  k to whom the senator has talked about the budget ceiling. but if he will read the senate budget scorekeeping report. we are  more than $100 million over in the health function. i am sure that the distinguished chairman of the full committee and the distinguished ranking miity member will bear out that we are $100 million over. to request an additional $5 million at this time would take us that much further above the budget ceiling. i am sure that the senator does  want that. senator muskie. the distinguished chairman of the budget committee. supports the position we are taking in opposing this amendment for those reasons that senator muskie is opposed to family planning. because of budget ceiling problems. as i said. we are over the budget ceiling for the health function.
i do  k what the senator is referring to. but senator muskies assistant. who is a counsel on the budget committee. has reaffirmed the statement i have made to the senator from pennsylvania. he pointed out the 550 health functioni am looking at page 15 of the scorekeeping summaryas indicating $100 million over the ceiling. the senator can say it is  budget busting. i think we have busted the health budget. if we are $100 million over. if we add $5 million to that. it is just busting it further. i do  think it is the intent of the senator from pennsylvania to take us even further over the budget ceiling than we already are.
i refer the senator to the distinguished chairman of the budget committee. i am reading from the same page as is the senator from pennsylvania. the "+0.1" means over the budget by $100 million. i do  see how we could possibly accept the amendment.
i am getting to the point where $5 million is longer a flea bite. i have been kn as a liberalmoderate. but $5 million is a lot of money. and i can consider it a flea bite. even though we are talking in terms of a total budget of $113 million for this year. perhaps the ranking miity member of the committee would like to comment.
i have been informed by the budget committee that the document does include the supplemental as well. so we are $100 million over. i do  think that anything further can be said. we agree in principle on family planning. we just do  agree that we can afford at this time to add any money for that purpose. however. we would be very pleased to consider it in the fiscal 1978 budget. . i believe the yeas and nays have been ordered
. i am today introducing legislation that will authorize further assistance for the victims of the earthquakes in italy that occurred in the summer and fall in 1976. the $25 million proposed for this purpose in this bill will become available in fiscal year 1978. i believe all americans can be pleased with the excellent use of the original $25 million provided to assist victims of this terrible disaster. those funds are being utilized to construct schools in the italian provinces of udine and pordee and an oldage home to be built by the national association of "alphini" veterans. an additional oldage home may also be built with these funds. amounts have also been allocated to cover the costs of the emergency supplies that were made available in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. while a good start has been made on helping the affected populace rebuild their destroyed homes and cities. much more needs to be done. italian estimates place the total cost of the damage from one of the worst earthquakes to strike europe at $4.9 billion. while the major burden for meeting the rehabilitation and reconstruction needs must be borne by the people of italy. i am convinced that the american people are willing to make this modest additional contribution to their efforts. legislation similar to the bill i am proposing has been introduced in the house. moreover. there is a bill pending in the senate that would provide $10 million for assistance to italy in fiscal year 1977. i certainly support that initiative by senator kennedy and senator pell and ask that my name be added as a cosponsor to their measure. the original $25 million plus the $10 million proposed for fiscal year 1977 plus the $25 million i am proposing for fiscal year 1978 will enable the american people to make a significant contribution to the renewal of hope for the people of the friuli region of italy. i. therefore. hope that the senate foreign relations committee. in its consideration of foreign assistance authorization for fiscal year 1978. will give serious consideration to the proposal i am introducing today. by mr. mathias:
i thank the senator. it would be popular. as the senator has said. to vote for all appropriations and to vote for all the tax cuts and never provide the revenue and let the country go down. i think the american people are wiser than that today. they recognize that that is a lot of demagoguery and that it is time for us in the senate and the house to stand up on these issues and lead. we have that responsibility to lead and  just to follow. we sometimes are privy to information that our constituents do nqt have. and they rely on us to give them sound advice and sound judgment and to cast sound votes. i may or may  vote for everything in the presidents package. but i think he has come forth. after a hundred days. with a strong. sensible energy tax package. i believe that by voting for this portion we could scuttle if before it gets started. i have that great fear. the senator from wyoming and i should be allies in this cause. because i remember that in the finance committee the senator was very kind in accepting my amendment. with some modification cuts. the president has gone further than the finance committee toward providing incentive because his list of eligible expenditures is much better than the one on which we finally compromised in 1976. it is a good. strong insulation tax proposal. i hope that the senate will see the wisdom. as unpopular as it may be today. of voting against it. as i will have to do. even though i originally proposed it. i will have to vote against it. in good conscience. because i intend to vote for the presidents proposal when it is before us for a vote. i hope the chairman understands my views on this.
the schweiker proposal would  do away with the current ceta level for public service jobs. but it would  address itself to the real problem facing the country today. the proposed level of 725.000 jobs only addresses 10 percent of the unemployed. the current level of 310.000 jobs would drop it down to less than 5 percent of the unemployed in the country. i do  think it is meaningful.
who is going to pay when the jobless have to go on unemployment compensation or relief. who will pay for it. that is what i am saying. i would much rather have someone working and earning and paying taxes than have them on relief or have them on uemployment benefits where the taxpayer has the heavy burden. i would much rather have these jobs created and have the unemployed actually working for their pay.
we tried. i voted with the senator the other day on the tax incentive. i voted for it because i wanted to see the stimulation in the private sector so we could created the jobs. that is my first choice. i believe it is senator williams first choice and senator magnusons first choice. but what do we do in a crisis situation such as this. we can wait for aher year. the unemployment rate would continue high. it is 7 million plus . what do we do with it. the private sector obviously is  employing the jobless. what is the alternative. that is what i ask the senator.
they are very legitimate concerns. i could  agree with the senator from utah more. they are legitimate concerns. i hope we have assured him that many changes are being made. statutorily and administratively and otherwise. we feel  that. through these changes. the 725.000 jobs that we are recommending will be protected against abuse.
i want to say that. having said all that. i could  agree with the senator from new york more. still. what the senator from utah has read. the gao report. and what i am sure motivated the senator from pennsylvania. was alarming. there is question. that is what instigated the reform in title vi. that is what we have done so far. we assure the senator we are going to monitor this. and monitor it very closely. to avoid fiscal substitution in funds that we are presently appropriating.
the senator said that this was a oneshot. temporary program and that it started in 1971. the senator is correctit did start in 1971. and it was intended to address itself to a particular situation. who could have predictedi do  think the senator from pennsylvania could have predictedthat we were going to have a recession that followed. that we were going to have doubledigit inflationall those factors which have affected the ecoy. the fact is that the crisis situation that we tried to address still remains almost at crisis proportion. the job has  been done. consistently. we have had high unemployment in the country. and it has  been taken care of by the private sector. we all would like it to be done by the private sector. but the fact remains that todaymay 2. 1977we still have more than 7 million unemployed in this country. do you k how it feels to be unemployed. if you say. "we will let the private sector do it." the fact is those jobs are  available. if they were available we would  be here today appropriating this money. so let us  talk about a oneshot operation. one shot can only apply when you have hit the target. we have  hit the target.
i certainly respect my chairman. i would like to point out to my chairmanand he is aware ofthe difference between this and revenue sharing. this is targeted money. this is targeted to the hardcore unemployed.
. i asked the distinguished chairman of the budget committee a question concerning how this amendment would change the actual numbers in the budget resolution. the distinguished chairman responded both for this community development amendment and for the next amendment on housing. he gave us the figures. and i will  repeat those figures here. but the point i was trying to make is that this amendment would have a minimal effect upon the budget deficit.
the distinguished senator from maine has explained his position well. i am sure that many of us on our committees have had to go along with the final decisions of our committee. but i am glad that he made two points. that this amendment would have a minimal effect upon the deficit. and that he made the good fight in the budget committee. i hope that his position in the budget committee rather than his position on the floor will be adopted by the majority of the members of the senate. i thank the distinguished senator.
i thank the distinguished chairman of the senate budget committee for this assurance. . i have an amendment to assure that $300 million will be available under the international affairs function for a mediumterm loan to portugal. it is  my intention to offer the amendment at this time. but i would ask the distinguished chairman. is the decision finally taken in the budget committee for that function that the funds would be available for a mediumterm loan to portugal in conformity with the foreign relations committees recommendation.
i thank the senator. . nsf. in this amendment is being criticized for the way in which it distributes its money. but this is unjustifiable criticism. in my opinion. the fact of the matter is that nsf attempts to fund the highest caliber research. if some institutions receive more contracts than others it is because they submit the proposals which are deemed more worthy of federal funding. i submit that to neglect some of these proposals just to provide a more equal distribution of nsf dollars would be a longterm disservice to the nation. the issue of geographic distribution of funds is very complex. it can be solved by awarding all states an equal amount of funds. many factors determine the amount of nsf support received by a state: the number and quality of its scientific research institutions. the number of ph. d. scientists and engineers in its labor force. the number and quality of proposals submitted. the number of degrees in science and engineering in the state. and others. the hatch amendment disregards all of these factors and requires that a fixed amount of money be provided to every state. the result. i fear. could be the funding of many mediocre research proposals for which the nation would suffer the consequences. fairer than looking at the total amount of nsf funds which a state receives is to look at the states success ratio. that is. the ratio of the number of awards received to proposals submitted. senator hatch charges that nsf is concentrating its money in four states: california. new york. colorado. and my home state of massachusetts. in terms of dollars received. these are the top 4 states receiving nsf support. yet. in terms of success ratio for fiscal year 1976. these four states are  all in the top 15. in fact. the correlation between dollars received and success ratio is  very high. below are the top 10 states ranked by success ratio and dollars received in fiscal year 1976. we will e that many of the top 10 states in terms of success ratio are "smaller states." states which are to be commended for the care with which they put together top quality research proposals.
. he would be confirmed by the senate. but i take it that my distinguished chairman of the banking. housing. and urban affairs committee feels there is some necessity for confirmation of the chairman of the federal reserve board. and i wonder why this does  equally apply to other boards and commissions as well.
i do  k that i have ever voted on a confirmation of a member of the board of govers of the federal reserve board in the 11 years i have served on this committee when i did  feel that. if the president should designate him as chairman. he could  serve well as chairman.
i read that letter addressed to our distinguished chairman which has been printed in the record. it said: dear . i have objectionin principleto the amendment you are planning to offer. i do  think that is a ringing endorsement of the senators amendment at all. i do  k what chairman burns could have said under the circumstances. if he had any objection to it. it would look as though he had something to fear by confirmation of the senate. on the other hand. he has already been confirmed by the senate. he was confirmed by the senate when he was appointed to the federal reserve board. as are all the other members of the federal reserve board and all members of the sec. fdic. the home loan bank board. and every other agency. i am just trying to ascertainand i will  belabor this pointwhy the distinguished chairman feels it is so important at this time that we confirm the chairman of the federal reserve board. i still can quite clearly understand that.
i understand the concept of leveraging. what i can understand. if i may have the attention of the senator from wisconsin. is if we take the example of city x. they got a $3 million community development grant. and can invest that money. they draw down their full entitlement from hud. they deposit the money in a savings and loan at. say. 5 percent interest. whatever interest rate they can get. and they use this money. that is a revenue loss to the treasury.
. i have read and studied senator humphreys fiscal stress. fiscal crises amendment. i am sure that it will prevent fiscal crises. i think it is a study that is very sorely needed. and i am very pleased to accept the amendment.
i have the greatest respect for the senator from oklahoma. and certainly for the senator from maine. who is proposing this amendment. with the exception of the senator from maine. because he voted against it in committee. would the senator from oklahoma agree that when the budget committee looked at the housing budget in considering the budget resolution. the reason for its reasoning behind the committee action so far as this program was cut in housing funds was the high rut costs due to the accounting method for computing budget authority.
my point is it is very misleading. and i believe we in housing suffer from it. when the cost figures are run out for up to 40 years. these amounts do  apply to the fiscal 1978 budget at all. the senator is talking about 40 years down the road. when we look at it in 1978-
that refers. again. to budget authority. i think the senator is confusing budget authority with appropriations. it says: the total amount of budget authority determined by the secretary under the preceding sentence shall be final for the purpose of section 201 of the budget and accounting act. 1921. and the congressional budget act of 1974. my point is the appropriations committee still-
it is  the purpose of section 208 to conceal anything. i think the chairman has made that crystal clear. that is  the purpose of this section in this bill at all. we want to reveal what we are obligated to spend in fiscal 1978. 1979. 1980. and 40 years from . but we do  want it to be charged to fiscal 1978. that is the point. we do  want it to appear that we are spending this money in fiscal 1978. because we are .
a contract is  made based on the budget authority. the contract is  binding until such time as the appropriations committee has approved of that contract. we just do  create budget authority and. therefore. have a binding contract.
as the senator ks well. the appropriate techogy was in the authorization bills of both the houses in fiscal 1977. erda operated under a continuing resolution after the authorization died in the senate. in the appropriations committee. i was able to get report language allowing erda to reprogram funds to start up. and they did put up $200.000. in the west coast region. to start up. the $2 million that the senator from idaho has indicated that erda has said it can spend. would nearly all be spent in california. i feel that this is a program that should be nationwide. i think the erda proposal is a very good. appropriate techogy program. i think it has many advantages and i shall  repeat all that i said in my opening statement. but it is so important that it ought to be a program that is given sufficient funding in order to be fully operative. frankly. i flew back all the way from boston. because i wanted to propose this and ask the senate to vote upon this. so strongly do i feel about it. i k that the distinguished floor manager of the bill and the ranking miity member are trying to hold the line. but it seems to me that we do have some $240 million. as i read the committees account. that could be available. although i k they have  gotten to the nuclear bill yet and i suspect they want to preserve some of that for that purpose. eight million dollars i shall  call peanuts. because $8 million is $8 million. it is a lot of money. but in the context of the massive erda budget we are talking about. especially since the house came in at a $10 million figure. the senate is low at the $2 million figure. this is a program that the senators themselves agreed was an important egh program to authorize fully in 1977. i should think that they would give more serious consideration to the authorization of a more realistic amount than $2 million. i respect and understand what happens in a conference. i k that if we go in with the house at 10 and the senate at 2. there is some likelihood. or some hope. i would say. that the program would get some additional funding. but i do  k. i should hate to see the house recede to the senate in this case. frankly. because i think $2 million is--i shall  say a waste. but it certainly will  begin to address itself to the problems that i think would be addressed if we had a more realistic figure.
when we get the new impact aid construction priority list from hew. the list that we were supposed to have by may 1. it will be easier to tell how much will be required to meet the needs at fort riley. let me assure you that the committee is aware of the needs in this area. according to the old priority list. it appears that fort riley would receive at least $6.000.000 in fiscal year 1978.
 will sign into law. the distinguished chairman and i. as late as this morning. have been looking for areas where we could make some cut that would make this bill more palatable to the administration. that the administration could in conscience sign. obviously. we all would agree that there is a need for more spending here as elsewhere in this particular bill. but again. we are faced with fiscal responsibility and we just can spend money that we do  have. i would ask the distinguished senator from missouri to consider a change in his amendment and take it back to the house amount. i will say why i would suggest that. that would meanand with an even heavier heart do i suggest ita $65 million cut from title i. it would take the program back to a position where it would  mean a great step forward. but it would . also. mean a step backward. when we go to the house. if we go with a further cut. then i am fearful the house. being also cognizant of fiscal constraint. might accept the senate figure and then it would be even further reduced. if we did that. i think we would achieve a purpose that the senator from missouri. certainly the chairman of the committee and i. would  like to see accomplished. but i do  think this is a matter we ought to bring to the senate for a vote. i think if the senator could see his way clear to modify his amendment accordingly. i suggest this would be a matter which the distinguished chairman could accept and i certainly could accept. then we could look elsewhere in this bill for other cuts. because i understand the senator has made a very important and a very firm case.
i appreciate the information given by my able colleague from virginia. i also refer to the foreign relations committee report. supplemental and miity views. where the head of the congressional budget office informed the committee: clearly. because the implementing legislation has  been submitted. the complete estimate of the budget impact of the treaties is impracticable at this time. and we still do  have that. obviously. it is still impracticable at this time to find out what the budget impact will be. i think  we should be talking about what the budget impact would be before we talk about any legislation.
the federal reserve board staff opinion concludes: provision of the federal reserve act or of the boards regulations provides a clear answer to the question posed. under existing law and regulation and considering past practices of the board. either of two conclusions may be urged: (1) the incumbent chairman could "hold over" in office and exercise the authority and perform the duties of the office until a qualified board member successor has been designated. or (2) the vice chairman could assume the responsibilities of the chairman. section 10 of the federal reserve act specifically assigns to the vice chairman the function of presiding at board meetings in the absence of the chairman. in the absence of both the chairman and vice chairman. the statute directs the board to elect a member to act as chairman pro tempore. the boards rules of organization implement this provision by directing the selection of the member of the board present with the longest service. for reasons discussed below. the more sound solution to the question presented would appear to be for the incumbent chairman to "hold over" in office until his successor has qualified to serve as a board member and as chairman. on february 2. president carter issued an order which reads as follows: order i hereby designate arthur f. burns to serve as acting chairman of the board of govers of the federal reserve system until such time as his successor as chairman is designated. or until his resignation as a member of the board of govers. already received and accepted. becomes effective. whichever first occurs.
i was going to say in conclusion that the mechanism is there. if we do  use it. it is our fault. i think we have been using it. if the senator wants to improve on that. that is aher thing. . i have hing further to say. i think we have exhausted this subject of the confirmation of g. william miller to be the federal reserve chairman. i think that it is only fitting . if the chairman. the senator from wisconsin. will agree. that we have a voice vote at this time.
. i take this opportunity to bring to the attention of my fellow senators a recent speech by our distinguished colleague from maryland. senator charles mathias. his remarks before the american school counselor association on the importance of education as a matter of national security are worthy of our attention. in particular. he makes a cogent case for better funding of several education programs largely neglected in the administrations fiscal 1979 budget request. and he has also made some thoughtful observations on the need for greater attention to the role of guidance and counseling in our nations schools. i urge my colleagues to read senator mathias speech. i submit the text of his speech for the record. the speech follows:
. the pending bill includes my amendment providing $63 million to cover increased minimum wage costs for the summer jobs for youth program. the funding is necessary because the administration inexplicably failed to request supplemental funds for this purpose for the summer program. led by our committee. congress provided $693 million for the summer program in this fiscal year. in conference with the house it was agreed that a level of 1.165.000 jobs would be authorizedand that was what happened. some time after acting on the summer youth program. congress did pass a law increasing the minimum wage to $2.65 an hour on january 1. we thus are mandated to pay that minimum wage in our federal jobs program. the labor department already has submitted supplemental requests of more than $100 million to cover the new minimum wage for the community service employment for older americans program. for ceta title i. and for several smaller manpower programs. although the labor department requested a similar supplemental for the summer program. the office of management and budget turned it down. instead the administration chose to absorb the increased minimum wage costs from the funds already provided for the summer program. the effect of the administration approach is to reduce the number of summer jobs from the level of 1.165.000 authorized by congress to the level of 1.020.000. a reduction of 145.000 jobs. if this action is permitted to stand. every state in the nation will lose jobs for youth in the coming summer months. my own state of massachusetts will be cut from 34.920 to 30.467. a reduction of 4.453 jobs. further the administration level will force states and local governments to cut back this years job program below the level of 1.076.000 slots provided for the summer of 1977. the administration approach strikes at one of the most vulnerable segments of the american work force. our young people. whose unemployment rates remain stubbornly high. for all teenagers. the primary beneficiaries of the summer program. the jobless rate is 16.9 percent. for black teenagers it is an unconscionable 35.3 percent. fortunately. our committee has moved to reverse the unwise action contemplated by the administration and has provided the $63 million necessary to cover the new minimum wage costs related to the summer program. our committees action will preserve jobs and will preserve congressional intent. the summer is just slightly more than 1 month away. we must get these needed funds into the hands of state and local governments and we must act  to do so. i urge adoption of the pending resolution containing the summer jobs for youth funds.
s urban policy would have provided additional funding for urban mass transit. but sadly. it has . i believe that a stronger federal commitment to mass transit is essential to support our broader national energy and urban goals. i could go on and on cataloguing the important programs we deal with. but it should be clear that we feel very strongly about them. we regard it as our duty to the senate and the nation to make recommendations which reflect the human needs and concerns of our society. we believe it would be an abdication of our responsibility to do otherwise. thus we have laid our plans for fiscal 1979 and in the weeks and months ahead we shall flesh these out with a series of funding decisions on each of the programs within our jurisdiction. the budget act anticipates our making these decisions. while it gives us "targets" to work with. it provides an environment of flexibility within which we may work. for the budget act is  an instrument to promote only the status quo or worse. but rather one through which the needs of the nation may be met with intelligence and with the utmost compassion for our less fortunate citizens. the process has been structured to provide us with this flexibility and we accept it. once we have made decisions that are in the nations interest. it then becomes the responsibility of the congress to rationalize these decisions within the second concurrent resolution that is adopted in september. the purpose of the second concurrent resolution is  to destroy what congress has done over the intervening months. but rather to develop a measure that takes cognizance of needs as well as resources. meantime. it is important to remember that we are only at the beginning of the budgetary process. the measure we are acting upon today is purely advisory. we still have a long way to goand many important decisions to makebefore we bind ourselves to mandatory ceilings for fiscal 1979.0
i have been exposed to it before. i do k that. all i am saying is that when we talk about cutting back we are talking about cutting back from this years funding level and the previous years funding level. we are  talking about the budget resolution.
it is  a matter of rejection. as i understand the numbers from hud. in fiscal 1978 we will have 380.000 units. in fiscal 1977 there were 388.000 units. and under this amendment we would have 360.000 units. so that is 20.000 units less than 1978 and 28.000 units less than fiscal 1977. that is the record and that is correct.
i do  think anybody here criticizes the budget committees responsibilities. everybody ks what the budget committee is trying to do. we are trying to live within congressional budget limitations and congressional ceilings. i think that is good. i think that is sound. but there is a question of priorities and where do we place them. the chairman said this is a consistent level. how can one say it is a consistent level when we are 20.000 units below the reservations of 1978 and 28.000 below 1977. where is the consistency. i do  k where the senator is getting his figures. he keeps saying cbo. cbo. cbo. does cbo  have to get their information and data from hud.
it seems to me that if the real basis of the chilesmuskie amendment is that this would be budget busting. this is an amendment that we should all accept. since it does  change the amount of the cut at all. is that correct.
. when the senator from florida and the senator from maine first introduced their amendment. it was my belief. and i think the senates belief. that they were primarily if  solely concerned with staying within the budget resolution. we argued that for about 2 hours.  it appears to me that the senator from florida. at least. has changed his position  that the senator from th carolina has come in with a compromise amendment. the compromise amendment does  add anything to the budget at all. but merely more equitably distributes the money among the housing programs that are contained in this bill. what the senator from florida  wants to do is to change the program that we spent the hours and days of hearings in the housing committee to develop. so he is going far beyond his original intent. which was to keep us within the budget. the senator from th carolina has proposed a compromise which keeps us within the budget. i happen to disagree with what the senator from th carolina would do. because i think we need more for housing in this country today. but at least i believe that the senator from th carolina. in his amendment. makes a more equitable distribution of those housing funds and at the same time stays within the budget resolution. the program that the senator from florida does  like is just a 1year program. it does  carry it any further. the cost of the 1year program is $25 million. and if the senator from florida does  like it he can come back and change it next year. but what the senator from florida is  doing is  arguing about the budget resolution. because. under the morgan amendment we are  budget busters. we are stayinq within the budget and are merely distributing the funds in a more equitable manner. i think that is much more sound than the original chiles amendment. therefore. although i would  like to see us restricted to the amount of money that would be contained in the morgan amendment. i would support the morgan amendment as the lesser of two evils. at least it does  bust the budget. and we are all budget conscious today. even i am budget conscious. i want the senator from florida to understand that. much as we want to do something here. we are penalizing the senior citizens and lowincome people in this country. and i hope we will  do that by at least adopting the morgan amendment. which does give them a better break insofar as the distribution of these funds is concerned. and yet stays within the budget resolution.
i think the senator from th carolina is exactly correct we are all in favor of the budget committee. but we do  want the budget committee to come in and set the programs for the authorizing committees. every senator can stand on this floor and put in an amendment to eliminate any program. we are  arguing that at all. what the senator from th carolina has done is that he has stayed within the budget resolution and reallocated the funds more equitably. that is the whole difference between what he has tried to do and what the chilesmuskie amendment would do.
i was concerned that the amendment of the distinguished senator from ohio would indicate that the senate supports the inclusion of federal subsidies in local property tax calculations. but if the senator from ohio is so concerned about this provision. as he obviously is. i would  object to its being removed from the bill if it is made clear. and i think he has made it clear. that we are  intending to support the position that states can include the value of federal subsidies for interest reduction or operating subsidies in assessing value for property tax purposes.
. this indexing bill would simply provide a more equitable tax system. for. in my opinion. an equitable taxing system taxes real income.  inal income. and this is precisely what my indexing bill will do. certainly. this is something that our taxpayers deserve. therefore. i urge my colleagues to expeditiously pass this important and necessary legislation.0 by mr. helms:
i ask unanimous consent that james lockemy. of senator thurmonds staff. barry kinsev. of the budget committee. and dick woods and douglas jackson. of senator bellmons staff. be granted the privilege of the floor.
it is a long way to go before this appropriations committee votes that kind of money. particularly today with inflation being what it is and the mood of the country to cut back. we k we will  get that kind of money. we even have trouble with an increase from $1.4 million to $6 million. which is an increase of $4.585 million. that is an increase from both the presidents request and the house allowance of $5 million.
that is a separate issue. the senator talks about fiscal responsibility. there should be something called fiscal equity as well as fiscal responsibility. i am just pointing this out to my distinguished colleague from texas. and i am  saying that it is irresponsible or anything of that nature. that houston already receives at least 50 percent of its operating deficit under the section 5 formula.
i think the senator is absolutely correct. on the other hand. i do want to see equity for those cities that are committed to mass transit. those cities which are  faring equitably under the existing formula. and it is very difficult to get congressional legislation which takes that into effect. it seems  that we are moving in the direction of revenue sharing. revenue sharing based upon population. and i am just suggesting to the distinguished senator from texas that in this amendment which was adopted by our committee we look at other criteria when we develop a formula that is going to be used for the distribution of mass transit funds. but i am certainly  picking on houston by any means and i want the senator from texas to understand it. i simply pointed that out to him.
 let me assure the senator from maine that cognizant as i am of the budgetary problems which he faces as chairman of our budget committee and. as he ks. i have supported him in his endeavors to stay within the budget. that is why the limitation was placed in the authorization. what the senator is suggesting is that we may  be able to hold to that limitation.
i thank my colleague from new york. i have always said whenever you have problems in any city of this country. you can find them multiplied in the city of new york. i k we have problems in transit. and this is a problem we will have to address. these three cities that i mentioned. new york. boston. and san francisco. actually carry 60 percent of the nations ridership. but rather than belabor this debate. since we have had a very spirited debate. the chairman and the ranking republican member of the budget committee. primarily. for budget reasons as i understand it.  that they are against rapid transit systems. have made their positions kn. i see that our colleague on the banking. housing. and urban aff airs committee. the distinguished former mayor of the city of indianapolis. and  a very distinguished member of our committee. is here to support this amendment. i believe that he would similarly raise the fiscal problemse of my colleagues. i think. are against mass transit. and they recognize that at sometime in the near future we have to develop a formula which is more equitable than the formula which exists at the present time as some critics have stated. as i have said. the cities eligible for this provision are subject to two caps: one. 50 percent of the operating deficit. which would mandate a 50percent local sharelocalities would have to come up with a 50percent matching share- and onethird of total operating expenses. those cities eligible for supplemental assistance are the only cities which must operate under both of these caps. under the existing formula. that does  exist. but under this formula. they would have to operate under both of those caps. i believe that these two requirements constitute the most significant constraints against inflationary increases in the bill. those are pretty severe constraints. when you have to come up with 50percent local money.  1. and you are constrained by a onethird cap on operating expenses. on the other hand. this bill eliminates the existing cap of 50percent funding of operating deficits by the federal government and substitutes the "onethird of operating expense" maximum of federal participation. i have yet to hear any complaint about the inequity and inflationary incentive of providing increased operating funds for those cities currently receiving 50percent funding under the formula. i never hear that. it is very strange. for those cities without the cap. there is complaint at all. rather. the administration and my colleagues who support the amendment of the distinguished senator from maine target their attacki am  talking about the senator from maine. i am talking about othersat those cities which have been unfairly treated under the existing formula and which are trying to "catch up" to those cities which are unfairly rewarded by the operation of the formula. that is my charge. these cities are being rewarded and they are being rewarded unfairly. because they are really  even committed to mass transit. yet they are getting the benefits without the liabilities or without the commitment. so to speak. the proponents of this amendment have certainly set a selective standard of fiscal responsibility. may i add that once those cities eligible for supplemental operating assistance receive 50 percent of their operating deficits. they would have to provide onehalf of any increase in operating expenses in order to receive increased federal assistance. that would be likely to require increases in state or local taxessuch as property taxeswhich. as we all k. will be very difficult for local officials to propose. requiring an increase in state and local tax dollars is a most effective disinceltive to increasing local operating deficits. i do  think you will find many mayors out there  or many city councilors out there  who are prepared to increase property taxes. they have heard of proposition 13. they have read about it. they k about it. for them to increase taxes. you can bet your bottom dollar they will do so only under the closest scrutiny and only for the best and most compelling reasons. namely. the necessity to have a viable mass transit system. . though i k what the opposition is. i still. in good conscience strongly urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to let our cities k that the federal government is prepared to act as a full partner in the most critical area of public transportation.
would he consider a rollback in capital gains tax as a possibility of creating new venture capital for new businesses or for the expansion of existing businesses. let me pursue this just a little farther. since the distinguished senator from missouri and the distinguished senator from new york are cosponsors of this amendment on the floor. i am primarily concerned about the expansion of existing businesses and the creation of new businesses in an effort to create jobs in the private sector. rather than jobs in the public sector. which is the direction we have taken over the years. i am sure that many senators are on the floor who have voted for public service jobs because of the high unemployment rate in this country. particularly in the last few years. that unemployment rate is still. i believe. unconscionably high. it  appears that we very well may  even see the goals which would be established by the humphreyhawkins bill. so. here we are. faced with the problems of high inflation and high unemployment. i agree with the senator from missouri and commend him in trying to find a manner in which we can stimulate the ecoy and expand american business. but i want to be sure that the way that he and the senator from new york are suggesting is the best way that we can accomplish these goals which we seek: namely. the expansion of existing american business and the creation of new american business. this in my opinion means the creation of new private sector jobs.
i certainly agree with the senator from new york. who is well versed in the whole subject of american business and what it means to this nation. however. the senator realizes that there will be many who will consider this amendment as merely a means of giving major u.s. corporations a tax break. they would argue that these cuts will result in profits for these corporations and their investors. while  assuring the expansion of business or the creation of jobs. that is why i raised the question. because i think it is the question that must be answered and answered successfully if we are going to get 51 senators to vote for this amendment. i am prepared to vote for the amendment myself. because i do believe in this system. i believe in the free enterprise system. i believe that. in addition thereto. if we do  do something. these corporations are  going to expand. further we are  going to have sufficient capital for the creation of new private sector jobs. which i think is the best direction for the country. in fact i believe that it should be the only direction in which it should go. barring some real national emergency where we have to resort to public service jobs. that is why i cosponsored the socalled steigerhansen bill some time ago. because i thought capital gains decrease would be one way of creating new venture capital and assuring the creation of new businesses and new industries and the expansion of existing businesses. that is the question we have got to answer. i think we have to hit it right on the head. that this is  just a tax break for the major corporations in this country. that this money will be used. it will be put back into the business.  just in dividends. although. i would agree that even if there are more dividends. that. too. has value in the american free enterprise system. but i think some money must go back into the expansion of american industry and the creation of new american jobs.
. i thank the distinguished senator from oklahoma. as our chairman has said. the distinguished senator from oklahoma performs a great service for the appropriations committee. he also serves on the budget committee. where he is the ranking republican member. and he is always there as the watchdog of the public treasury. we have the greatest admiration and respect for him. he is very helpful to us in our deliberations. and we commend him for it. and just wish to say we are happy to have him on our committee. as well as our chairman. who also is a member of the senate budget committee as well. i believe the distinguished senator from florida . who is  on the floor. also serves on the budget committee. we debate on many issues. but i have the greatest resnect for lawton chiles and the work that he performs on the laborhew appropriations subcommittee and the full appropriations committee. and i say that with all the sincerity i can muster.
. i hope we shall sustain the appropriations committees action reducing the ceta public service jobs program only by 100.000 and only through mal attrition.  through layoffs. the currently appropriated level for public service jobs is 725.000. in light of the fact that the overall employment situation is improved. our committee felt there was justification for making some reduction public service jobs. thus. the committee amendment provides that the level shall be cut from 725.000 to 625.000 by next september 30 using mal attrition layoffsas the means to achieve the new level. the 100.000 reduction is based upon an expected 5.8percent unemployment rate for the present fiscal year. this expectation is verified by the secretary of labor in a recent letter to our chairman. senator magnuson. in that letter of october 12. secretary marshall said: the administrations latest forecase. prepared for the midsession review. predicted and unemployment rate of 5.8 percent for 1979. since that time. the administration has take e of a somewhat slower ecoic growth in the latter half of this year. on the basis of this slower growth. it is highly likely that the next administration forecast will show unemployment rates somewhat higher than those forecasted previously. thus the outlook is for more lessunemployment. i understand that the pending amendment may be based on an unemployment estimate of 5.7 percent provided by the congressional budget office (cbo). i understand that this is only the midpoint of a cbo projection ranging between 5.2 and 6.0 percent. indicating some uncertainty by that office. we are told the pending amendment will make a cut of 68.000 in the average level of public service jobs. but upon closer examination we find the actual cut will be 136.000 below the currently appropriated total. thus. the yearend level under the amendment will be 589.000. this means cutting 36.000 more jobs that the committee calls for. i can be a party to such an excessive cut at a time when unemployment remains high and some 900.000 other jobless persons have given up looking for jobs and are  even counted in the unemployment rate. our committee amendment is based on sound data and sound reasoning and is consistent with the need to be very sensitive about the uncertain job situation in this country. for these reasons. the proposed amendment should be rejected.*
. that is the very basis we have urged upon the department and we believe and submit to you that is the only basis upon which these federal funds can fairly and equitably be distributed for this program. you will e this does  affect the current program. we recognize that the department has already committed itself to the program for this fiscal year and while we regret it. we do  believe it will be proper or fair to attempt to change that formula as it applies to the current appropriation. but we do feel this would be an indication. if the amendment is adopted. of the dissatisfaction of congress with the inequitable nature of the present revised formula. and definitely a clear. specific direction to the department.  that an expression has been made by the house that we should undertake this program for the next fiscal year. that it should immediately provide aher formula to govern the distribution of these funds which will justly recognize throughout the united states the actual and proven conservation needs of every state. those members who have had the opportunity to read the record of yesterday may be interested in the states which will be affected by this reduction. and while i will  give the amounts involved i would like to run through the 22 states where the work will be reduced substantially by reason of this change in formula.
. although i had hoped that the subcommittee would find it possible to include in this bill $100.000 for the initiation of construction of the floodcontrol project on the hoosic river at th adams. mass.. and $500.000 for the initiation of construction of the floodcontrol project on the same river at adams. mass.. yet i recognize the difficulty confronting the subcommittee in view of the fact that it did  have before it any estimates on these items from the bureau of the budget. unfortunately. there was a flood december 31 last. which caused very severe damage in these communities. this occurred after the budget had been completed. consequently. the only course open to the people of these communities and their representatives was to present the full facts to the subcommittee in the hope that those facts would appeal to the members of the subcommittee as warranting emergency action. even though this was  the result. i do believe that the members recognized the seriousness of the situation. and i venture thelopinion that they would have so acted if there had been the estimates i believe are justified entirely in terms of the memorandum addressed to me. dated march 4. 1949. signed by lt. col. h. c. gee. deputy chief of civil works for flood control. corps of engineers. and aher memorandum as to the details of the projects. whey are as follows:
unfortunately. the copy of the budget i had is temporarily mislaid. let me ask the gentleman from arkansas if we are  in accord that the budget itself says  only in figures in two places but in text that all they can spend in 1951 effectively is $500.000.
that is right. i commend the gentleman for going that far. but i think the house is entitled to a clear opportunity here on as to how far it wants to go in the next year in the absence of any defined program and without anything like exact estimates. there are many differences of opinion as to how far this program will go. ody ks. ody can accurately tell you what the figure will be. however. in the first annual report of the presidents scientific research board. on august 27. 1947. this language appears at page 31: . the federal government should spend ab6ut $50.000.000 for support of basic research outside its own laboratories in 1949. from that point grants for basic research should increase rapidly until they reach an annual rate of $10.000.000.  of $15.000.000. butof at least $250.000.000 by 1957. yet. at page 26 of the same report there is the following language: as a nation. we should sprnd each year less than 1 percent of our national income for research and development the physical and biological sciences. including medicine. it is true that the board is talking in terms of national income for research and development which is an allinclusive term beyond both the basic research we are  discussing and the much larger field of even applied research. that is one emous difficulty in considering this problem because we find fixed into government termiogy and in budget presentations the general term of research and development. then consider aher paragraph in that report: we will have the trained manpower to support a program of this magnitude by 1957. assuming in that year a national income of over $200.000.000.000. our national research budget should then be more than $2.000.000.000. again. this is a suggested figure of $2.000.000.000 over all. and although it defines it as our national research budget. as i read the paragraph it is referring to basic and applied research and development in the federal government. in other public bodies. in industry. and in our universities and colleges. nevertheless. i call your attention to the specific language of still a third paragraph on page 27. after discussing the sharp decline in endowment income. the limiting of sources of new endowment funds by taxation. and other factors. the board states: in view of these considerations. we should anticipate federal expenditures in support of research and development of more than $1.000.000.000 a year by 1957. then i am confronted. and i think all of us are confronted. with a very practical dilemma. yesterday i pointed out that the budget. at page 1118. lists expenditures for research and development as actually $940.000.000 in 1949. $964.000.000 estimated in 1950. and $953.000.000 estimated in 1951. the gentleman from south dakota has shown me aher tabulation which i understand to be an official one indicating that already the federal budget requests are far in excess of $1.000.000.000 this year and steadily mounting. it occurs to me that this is primarly because of the wide scope of what is called research in the federal government and perhaps because it appears that very substantial expenditures for construction of facilities are  classified as strictly research and development. i pointed out yesterday that there is a request for construction at langley field. va.. which is. i think. carried in the independent offices appropriation act of 1949 with an item of $1.000.000. i do  k whether this is classified strictly as research or . i pointed out that the medicalresearch facilities at bethesda are being expended. that the principal building is  in its second year of construction with a clinical center and a research laboratory to be equipped with 500 research beds for clinical research in cancer. heart. metabolic. and infectious diseases. certainly this is an excellent program of which i am sure we all approve but let me point out that the budget calls for an appropriation of $15.125.000 which is in addition to the $18.100.000 appropriated to date. here again i do  k whether that is classified as within the research program or. rather. treated as a construction item. my whole point is that i do  think that. with all due respect to the many people who have been interested in this matter and are interested in this matter. anyone is in a position to state with exactness. whether we will require one. two. three. five. or fifteen million dollars. as suggested by the gentleman from arkansas and others. $25.000.000. as others so persuasively suggest as a minimum. $27.500.000. as still others suggest. or even $250.000.000. for basic research as far off as 1957. in view of all these contradictions. and for that reason. i am suggesting $1.000.000 as a ceiling in 1952. coneededly. that is an- arbitrary limitation. if someone wishes to place it at $5.000.000 or $7.500.000 and can produce further evidence to support that as a figure. i should be inclined to support that amendment. but i do want to leave the record entirely clear that. in my opinion. we should deal with the facts as they are contained in the recommendations of the president in his budget message. should have presented to the interstate and foreign commerce committee a continuing report of the development of the national science foundation program with accurate estimates as to what may be required in fiscal 1951. so that we will be prepared to act intelligently on any further authorization in 1952 and prepared during the ensuing 11 months to state with some authority to the house what we believe to be a proper ceiling. let me conclude this phase of my explanation of the reasons for this amendment with one paragraph from the boards report at page 25: what is here proposed. therefore. is  a maximum. but a minimum annual national research and development budget for the futurea budget below which we can afford to fall. it is in the nature of a recommended floor for expenditures. rather than an optimum ceiling. we have been talking  about a ceiling. too frequently we have found that any ceiling becomes a floor. i commend the board for its frankness in including this paragraph in its report and i am entirely sincere in making that statement. i have repeatedly commended this board for the work it has done and for these excellent reports. i recognize the limitations under which it had to work. both as to time. as to funds and personnel available. and as to the extreme complexity of the subject matter with which it was dealing. but. as my chief witness on this point. i believe that the board has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that wise. sound figure can be suggested by any one for the fiscal year 1952. i wish the gentleman from arkansas had taken the clear limitation recommended by the budget for fiscal 1951 and stopped there. since he did  do so. i want the record clear as to my reasons for questioning the wisdom of placing any limitation on fiscal 1952 until we have sufficient kledge of the program and of its requirements so that we can approve. a reasonable authorization. surely. if this bill passes and becomes law. all those interested in creating the foundation and making it operate successfully are going to believe that the majority of this and future congresses will recognize the necessity of supporting a soundly conceived and well administered program. personally. i believe we can count on our scientists. engineers and other technicians to work effectively to develop such a program and to implement it. i think of them first as loyal americans willing and anxious to work with us in the interest of the security. the ecoic wellbeing and the health of the united states. the overwhelming majority of them. with rare exceptions indeed. proved that conclusively in the crucial days in 194045. i certainly credit them with as much interest in and devotion to this countrys security  as then and i would be amazed if as many as 6 of them declined a request to assist in creating a sound structure and program for this foundation. we all k that public service is something this nation has never had to buy. why should we fear that our history would reverse itself between  and the early months of 1952. i think the members are entitled to all the information the committee can develop. i have the highest regard for my friend from arkansas and all the members of this committee. i k they are sincere and i k they are worried. and i am worried and that is one fundamental reason for my support of this bill. i said yesterday that in the defense department in research alone they have been able to cut back in 2 years $82.000.000. i urge upon you to realize there is reason to believe if we put this law into effect and set up an effective agency. instead of increasing the cost of government. to the extent of $105.000.000 as outlined in the budget requests of agencies other than the national defense for 1950 and 1951. we can and we should save a substantial portion. is that wishful thinking. i do  think so. if the defense department has attacked this thing realistically and has applied standards and has created a balanced program. as it surely has. then through the medium of the national science foundation. if we make this a law. we can hope  only to save all which involved even in this proposed ceiling for 1952. but many more millions of dollars. have i any ground for saying that. i think so. this morning i talked with an executive officer in the national defense department. i k this is  considered classified information. i was told that out of the military budget they can turn over a minimum of $15.000.000 or a maximum of $20.000.000 in the current funds to this newly created science foundation. i concede that that will  cover scholarships. but let us be realistic about it. it will set this program going. this is the defense department only. what of the others. and i remain unconvinced that we can hope to start the fellowship and scholarship program going until 1952 at the earliest. this is  the measure which has passed the other body. i personally believe it is a much better and more refined version. it has to go to conference. we can get more information and our conference committee can iron this out. but why should we project ourselves clear into 1952 by saying. "you have permission to go up to $15.000.000." remember that is a minimum and i predict it will be so construed irrespective of what any of us say here during this debate. i say the situation is one where we should. as the gentleman from new york has so ably suggested. stop. look. and listen. i do  want to wreck this program and i do  believe i am doing so. this is  intended as and it is  a crippling amendment. it should help to gain support for the bill and the foundation. it is translating the presidents budget message to a dollar. as i read that message. if the president and the budget bureau are right. i am right. if they are wrong. i shall be openminded as to any other figure. but one yet has offered reasons for aher figure. i am concerned about some of the figures which i gave to the committee yesterday about what they are doing in soviet russia. they are  my figures. they come from the department of national defense. i call your attention to the fact that these are figures from behind the iron curtain which are believed to be accurate. the budget of the soviet union for 1947 is reported to provide $1.200.000.000 for this purpose as compared with outlays of $900.000.000 in 1946. what were we doing in 1949. we were spending $940.000.000. then there is something more. i am told our government does  have any figure it can isolate. but through 1948 and 1949. the total military expenditures of soviet russia appear to have increased by about 20 percent. but listen to this. at the same time expenditures for scientific research and development appear to have increased 80 percent. those are increases over 1947.
. on february 13. 1950. i reported on theofficial commodity inventories of the commodity credit corporation of 10 items which apparently could be utilized as surplus edible food. this was as of december 31. 1949. the total amount approximated 277.480 tons of surplus food commodities at a total cost of about $265.000.000. it was exclusive of the 50.000.000 bushels of surplus edible potatoes involved in the order of destruction which fortunately appears  to have been carried out to any substantial degree. there are some very significant statistics in the hearings before the subcommittee on appropriations for the department of agriculture which have been released this week. this aftern i want to call your particular attention to the table beginning at page 1418 of those hearings starting with average monthly storage rates paid on commodities owned and. more especially the carrying charges on pricesupport commodities. fiscal year 1949 and first half of fiscal year 1950. there is a ation explaining thatcarrying charges include transportation costs. warehouse charges. and other costs associated with the commodity including cost of sacks used. sacking charges. cooperage. weighing and inspection fees. reconsignment costs. etc.. which are charged to inventory. storage charges paid or accrued on loan collateral while under loan is charged to the cost of the commodities so. acquired and any costs incurred directly pursuant to purchase arrangements are included in the purchase cost. i have taken the carrying charges for the list of commodities i previously reported on so that we might have before us the total cost of those charges. with the exception of canned mexican meat and i do  find the carrying charges on that item listed in the hearings before the subcommittee on appropriations. then i call your attention to the statistics in the same hearings as to the use made of these and other products in the schoollunch program which we find at pages 1499 and 1500. while many other surplus food products are used. there is indication that butter. edible dried beans. edible pried peas. rice. or turkeys have been distributed under that program. i do  k the reason for this but shall attempt to locate it. for my present purpose i want to emphasize that in the first half of this fiscal year we have apparently paid a total of $10.786.209 for carrying charges on these commodities. judging by some of the startling increases over the cost of these carrying charges for the full year fiscal 1948. the total for fiscal 1949 will run very substantially in excess of the totals for fiscal 1948. this should focus attention on the resolutions introduced by the gentleman from pennsylvania . the gentleman from new york . the gentleman from pennsylvania . and myself on february 2. 1950. and supported by 24 others of our colleagues. may i refer to the record on february 20. 1950. at page 2000: let me quote the last sentence from those resolutions: the secretary of agriculture and the commodity credit corporation may advance as against handling and transportation costs in making delivery up to the equivalent of 6 months storage costs on any such commodlties turned over. if these carrying charges on these items have continued at that rate during the first half of the fiscal year. they are running in excess of approximately $60.000 a day for a completely useless waste of public funds. from the date of the introduction of these resolutions. there is an accumulated waste which i am convinced will finally be in the order of $2.= 000.000. for every day lost in trying to get action on these resolutions the taxpayers will foot the bill to the tune of better than $60.000. putting it aher way. every hours delay means a complete waste of federal funds at the rate of better than $2.700 an hour. or more than $100 each minute. i anticipate that someone will most certainly come forward with the argument that there have been net gains over the entire period of substantial amounts. for instance. that since october 17. 1933. when the pricesupport program for domestic cotton began. there is a net gain of $236.359.485. or. again. that on the pricesupport program on basic commodities that there has been a net gain in that period of $69.993.162. of course it will be hoped by such an argument to indicate that a $100aminute loss in these specific carrying charges is a mi item and undoubtedly will be absorbed by net gains. however. it will overlook the fact that the commodity credit corporations own analysis of the program shows net losses from october 17. 1933. through december 31. 1949. including the wartime consumer subsidy program. of $2.101.850.443 for $2.242.642.817. and of even more importance any such argument entirely overlooks the fact that these carrying charges are a completely unwarranted and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer even though other parts of the program may well be justified upon further examination of the facts. i am glad to report that i have received an encouraging letter from the chairman on the house committee on agriculture under date of march 2 reading as follows:
 who leaves for key west on sunday morning. i hope he will do something about this mess before he leaves. if he does . it certainly means something in the order of $2.000.000 will go down the drain before he returns. i have heard hing from secretary brannan who i understand is somewhere in the midwest. there is action whatever by anybody. i can understand it and i do  believe the american people are going to understand it. certainly. with income taxes due a week from today these people are going to be faced with a picture of millions of dollars of their tax money lost. it is a tragedy in every sense of the word. i call your attention to the endorsement of bills filed by four of us february 2 and  pending before the committee on agriculture at page 2954 of yesterdays record. there are millions of men and women and boys and girls in these 54 organizations who want this situation remedied at once. and who say that they can take care of a minimum of 39.000 tons of these surplus food products in 6 months. if a bill can only be made law to take care of the situation. if there is such provision of law. they can afford to accept only about 4.000 tons. late this aftern i received a letter from mr. hutchinson. acting secretary. which presents a very clear statement as follows: with reference to further disposal of potatoes by this means. please understand that order has been issued which compels dumping or destruction. are we -to understand that the press was completely misinformed when secretary brannan sent out his famous order on the evening of february 3. and when he was extensively quoted as to the amount which would be destroyed. the unit bushel cost of destruction and the overall estimate of that cost. all i can say at this moment is that i hope this presents a change in policy. of course i k that the department is reported to be exerting effort to develop and expand outlets for useful purposes but the best immediate demonstration of its good faith would be in cooperating with those of us who want to get these food items out of storage houses and into the hands of needy people upon a paidfreight basis. why can the department send a favorable report to the committee on our bills. the letter follows:
. or anyone else responsible. directly or indirectly. for permitting this mess to continue. that is his privilege. but i suggest that he is going to find it difficult to defend or explain it to the men and women in his district who pay direct or indirect taxes to the federal government. or to the hundreds. perhaps thousands. of men. women. and children who could- qualify to receive and eat these food items today if this red tape could be untangled. and i defy anyone to take this floor and assert that that can be done.
i believe this amendmont is a prerequisite if we are to have any legislation before us which will be satisfactory. i do  think anyone can deny that the authorization reported by the committee is excessive and could  be wisely used in fiscal 1951. we should be realistic. even though this is a constructive approach toward the solution of this problem. hing would be gained and much might be lost by overextending ourselves. i hope the amendment will be adopted.
. first i want to say i think the subcommittee has done a remarkably fine piece of work on a very difficult bill. i would like to ask a question with reference to the development of the amount the committee has inserted in the bill for administrative expenses of the commodity credit corporation. i have studied the hearings and the data in thehearings. as well as the latest report of the commodity credit corporation. i realize how difficult it is to arrive at any figure. since the information is  current. but i do  k from the report itself how it is that even though the committee felt $5.200.000 should be cut from the budget estimate. how it was they arrived at $15.000.000. for instance. in contrast to $13.000.000 or $14.000.000. i wonder if the gentleman could give us some information on that.
 of the subcommittee stated in effect that there could be definite certainty as to exactly what amount was necessary. many of my colleagues k that i have been studying the operation of this particular agency for a good many months. from time to time i have reported the facts i have been able to develop and have expressed my very real concern as to whether certain of its operations were in any sense of the word satisfactory or justifiable. since the committee report and hearings became available i have tried to examine the evidence pertinent to the point of the amount to be appropriated for this purpose. i have also studied as carefully as i could this agencys report of financial condition and operations as of march 31. 1951. which was made public on monday. by tomorrow i hope to be able to complete certain comparisons as to the operation of this agency during the last few years with a view to arriving at a figure which i believe should be seriously considered by us as the amount to be provided in this item. i recognize that this is a limitation or a ceiling. but i think we would all agree that congress has an obligation itself to place as realistic a limitation as is humanly possible. particularly when we k that aher subcommittee of the appropriations committee is  working on a budget item which apparently will be in the neighborhood of $60.000.000.000. i submit that wherever we can insure that unnecessary expenditures will be made by the federal government through any of its agencies. it is our clear duty to do that. at this time. and because so much of the information available to us is in the form of quite complex statistics. i want to make readily accessible to all members for the record of tomorrow some of the basic data that i have been able to develop. first. the question has arisen as to the accumulated losses during this current fiscal year on the puichase and disposition of certain of these commodities. i have taken from the march 31 report the figures for inventory in pounds and .n dollars on butter. cheese. dried milk. dried eggs. and irish potatoes. on these five items alone. the decrease since june 30. 1950. in pounds. amount to 505.689832. the decrease in dollars is $182.982.065.84. the loss on disposition totals $203.845.928.12. then. may i point out. and this is extremely significant in terms of arriving at a reasonable amount for these operations. that during this 9month period the total amount of the carrying charges for these five items is $9.723.301.15. this is certainly money that is gone forever. and largely paid for the storage of these five commodities. incidentally. it may be of interest to e that during this same period. the government purchased 282.584.120 pounds of shelled peanuts. sold 282.580.560 pounds. and that the loss on disposition amounted to $11.244.022.37. the details as to these facts are as follows: inventory june 30. 1950 mar. 31. 1651 june 30. 1950 afar. 31. 1951 pounds pounds

us.  to recognize that there is real likelihood whatever that this agency will have to pay in fiscal 1952 for the cost of storing anything like the amount of these commodities. as was the case in the last fiscal year. in this connection. i have made a comparison of the amounts of inventories of a number of cqmmodities on hand june 30. 1950. and on hand march 31. 1951. first. i have compared 16

. i greatly appreciate the action taken by the gentleman from mississippi and the gentleman from minnesota . as well as that of the entire subcommittee. i am certain that this is a move in the right direction. so that the background of the amendment may be fully explained and available to the commodity credit corporation. i want to outline briefly the facts which led me to submit it. it would set aside $1.000.000 from the $15.000.000 recommended by the subcommittee for administrative expenses in a reserve fund and expenditures could be made from that $1.0c2.000 unless and until the existence of substantial surpluses of t.-e basic commodities developed to justify any use of any part of this $1.000.000. the budget estimate was for $20.200.000. any study of the hearings presents convincing evidence of the wisdom of the subcommittees decision to recommend a reduction of $5.200.000. it r y be thought that this reduction is sostantial. of course. it is. but there is clear and sufficient evidence to convince anyone that we are amply warranted in making this further restriction. it is clear from the hearings that satisfactory effort was made by this agency to relate its requests for funds to its requirements or to existing conditions. it just used the same figure it used when it submitted its supplemental request to congress on ember 29. 1950. of $3.850.000. bringing the total request in fiscal 1951 to $20.200.000. the subcommittee was amply warranted in reporting that "this"-its---"reduction is believed justified in view of the current outlook for agriculture and the probable change from surpluses to shortages in many of the commodities mally handled by the corporation." it is equally clear that the request submitted last fall and presented to the subcommittee on february 12 has relation to the agencys activities . or in prospect for fiscal 1952. its latest report is for the month ending march 31. i placed in the record last wednesday the results of a study of its commodity inventories on march 31 compared to june 30. 1950. in butter. cheese. dried milk. and dried eggs alone there was a reduction of 505.699.732 pounds. from 677.401.610 pounds to 171.701.878 pounds. extending this to 16 commodities. the reduction is from 6.561.211.062 pounds to 2.604.691.295 pounds. or a decrease of 60.3 percent. the same sharp downward trend in holdings is evident in most of the other commodjities. let me give you seven examples: june 30. mar. 31. cotton ---------------- bales. 3. 413. 635 86.813 cottonseed -------------- tons.- 211.178 2.941 flxseed ------------- bushels.- 13. 373. 583 5.117. 761 turpentine ----------- gallons. 2. .w. 765 00. oo oats --------------- bushels._ 12. 108.620 9. 997. 233 rye ---------------- do . 514. 624 364. 274 soybeans --------------- do ---- 53.017 1.003 an examination of the estimate shows that about 75 percent is for personal services. $15.042.000 of the $20.200.000. it is significant that this agencys estimate shows a request for 814 more employees than in fiscal 1951. from 3.721 to 4.535. it is of greater significance that its representative offered as one justification for its request that 2 or 3 weeks before its last appearance before the subcommittee on february 20. it had asked to be declared. and had been declared. a defense agency. this resulted in a very proper and pertinent examination by the subcommittee. let me quote:
. this amendment. i k. has great superficial appeal to everyone who wants to stop this spiral of inflation and to provide some relief to the people of this country. but i am rather concernedand i have been considering the implications of the amendment for nearly an houras to what it may do. it so happens that in my district a substantial part of the industrial production is in electrical equipment. heavy and light. in electronic equipment. and in steel tools and machinery. yesterday the ops issued three orders. they become effective today. they affect all of those items. those orders allow for increases in the manufacturing costs of those items. the raw materials responsible for these cost increases ranging from 45 to 120 percent since last january are tungsten. tungsten concentrates. ferrotungsten. and tungsten powder. produced elsewhere. there is practical -way by which these costs can be controlled in this country. in almost every instance those items are of very definite immediate importance in terms of the national defense. some of them aie under security restriction. . if adoption of this amendment should nullify these relief orders. that undoubtedly would jeopardize production which 1- vitally essential to our national defense and the security of this country. i understand. and i hope the gentleman from georgia will correct me if i am wrong. that his amendment provides for a manufacturers price ceiling for 4 months as of july 7. but that it does  provide for any means of relief for anyone who is manufacturing essential materials or defense materials.
. i realize. too. that in a minute and a half it is impossible to cover even the basic grounds for my conviction that the crosser bill should be accepted by the committee. i do want to try to cover two points. one of which has  been emphasized very much in the course of this debate. in the first place. one of the principles we must follow is that this fund be kept solvent. if you accept the committee bill. it has been reliably estimated that an annual deficit of over $108.000.000 will be incurred. if you support the bill that the gentleman from. ohio has suggested. the estimate is that the fund would rise gradually for between 15 to 20 years to apoinz of $7.600.000.000. andthen level off at $7.500.000.000. to vote for the committee bill. the only alternative that is  before us is a calculated and deliberate action leading to wrecking this fund. to vote for the crosser bill is to vote to do as much as can be done for those who need it the most. particularly the widows and the dependent children and still maintain the solvency of this fund. and the needs of these beneficiaries would be more fully met. which is the second point. under the committee bill they would get a pitiful increase of anywhere from $7 to $10. but under the crosser bill would get an increase of at least $60 anb possibly up to $75. i ask you to take these facts into consideration before you vote on these proposals.
i would say that many of us who supported the provisions of the amendment offered by the gentleman from ohio would undoubtedly be willing to go along with most of the features of the senate bill to get something done. the gentleman from michigan suggests that we are literally providing possibility of paying these increases. how are you going to explain this action to these people when the day comes and you have to say. "we must increase your taxes or we must reduce these benefits." that is the question that will be asked of us if we act hastily tonight without sound consideration of the fiscal side of this picture. i want these benefits increased. i am sure we all do. but i want our action  to be such that we can defend and explain it and that it will be a case of continued maintenance of the increases. surely those who have expressed concern about increased payments to this fund because the proposed increase in the tax base should be equally concerned as to whether there will have to be increased tax rates soon under this proposal. i think we would all expect these beneficiaries to adjust their standards of living upward upon receiving increased benefits. surely one would want to have to reduce them later if this proposal made that or an increased tax rate necessary. from the study i have been able to give to this proposal in these few minut 2s. i do believe it is an infinitely better suggestion than the committee bill. while i question whether an opportunity for a few short hours study of it is likely to be granted. i feel strongly that for the record. for the conference. and for the future. at least this warning of the possibilities should be given. i think it is my responsibility to do this and i appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues in permitting me to do so.
. at this late hour i do  intend to take 5 minutes. however. i do think that to those of you who felt that $75 million was in excess of the amount you wanted to support this amendment. which carries the recommended amount by the eisenhower administration. can well be supported. i want to add 1 or 2 points about this program which has been under the jurisdiction of the legislative committee. the committee on interstate and foreign commerce. over these years and has been handled on a thoroughly partisan basis. i do  k whether you have had the opportunity to examine the pertinent facts. but there have been 1.980 approved projects all over this country. there are 1.475 general hospitals. of the nearly 2.000 projects. 1.100 are completed. 700 are under construction. and the remaining are in the planning or drawing board stage. they will add .96.500 beds and over 300 publichealth centers and related facilities. four hundred and thirty communities  have hospitals for the first time. 151 more  have good hospitals where existing ones were substandard. it is very significant that 59 percent of the new facilities are in the communities that have populations of 5.000 or less. and only 7 percent are located in cities which have in excess of 500.000 population. this. in my judgment. is the answer to the cries for socialized medicine. it is a practical and partial answer to the maldistribution of doctors. nurses. and other personnel. as far as i k. although there has been a suggestion of some maladministration of this program in some vague instance. there is a general approval of the way in which the program has been handled throughout the country. i think this is attributable largely to the fact that the committee originally and since that time has insisted that the new program should be handled primarily by the state and local authorities where the people themselves have had an opportunity to determine and observe  only the kind of construction but also the administration of this program. there is . according to reliable information. something over a 900.000 bed deficit in this country. as the gentleman from arkansas pointed out. our failure to keep pace with population growth is due largely to the drastic cutback after korea. i suggest that all of us who are interested in balancing the budget and in supporting this administration. should take the advice of this administration in this instance and permit at least this additional amount for the current fiscal year.
 signed it. this is clear and convincing evidence of approval of the program as it has been administered. finally. this approval is further indicated by the inclusion of the figure of $75.000.000 for fiscal 1954 in this report. in contrast to the $50.000.000 so provided in the first house action.
 theodore roosevelt. it will require the development of clear guidelines to be established by the congress as to the proper functions of the federal government. a review is being made of the basic power policies of the federal. government in connection with multiplepurpose river basin development as it relates to private ecoic development. * * * * there are under detailed study various proposals for dealing with the complicated problems of overlapping and duplicative authority among the several resource development agencies. * * * * s conserving and improving our land and water resources is high priority business for all of us. it is the purpose of this administration to present to the next session of the congress suitable recommendations for achieving the objectives set forth in this message. i am confident that the studies of governmental organization and functions authorized by this congress can also make an important contribution to the solution of these problems. as the congress moves ahead on a constructive legislative program in the resource field. it will have my full support and cooperation. we must build a balanced program for the use and development of all our natural resources. such a program is indispensable to maintaining and improving our standard of living as we make the future secure for a growing america. finally. and so that the record may be complete. i am including a copy of a letter from willard w. gatchell. general counsel of the federal power commission and of a letter from jerome k. kuykendall. chairman of the federal power commission. a list of the state and municipal licensees paying these administrative annual charges during fiscal years 1953. a table showing the administrative fees received in the fiscal year ending june 30. 1952. from all licensees. and section 1 of public law 109 of this congress. an act to establish a commission on intergovernmental relations. to which i have referred:
 of the committee. if i may. a question for the purposes of clarification. as i understand it. the committee restored the full amount of money appropriated for this purpose in the last fiscal year. mr. h. carl andersen. the gentleman is correct. the committee restored the proposed reduction of $331.600. making available $528.800. the same amount as available in 1954.
may i just quote from a letter dated july 18. signed by mr. alan t. waterman. director of the national science foundation. he states: the foundation carried over on july 1 1954. more research proposals of high caliber than it will be able to support during the entire 1955 fiscal year. we will assuredly receive more research proposals this year than last.
i would like to ask two questions which may  be proper. which might be called classified. but which would be helpful to those of us who do  serve on the committee on appropriations. i refer to what the gentleman said a few minutes ago. is it possible to say how much of the funds appropriated for the last fiscal year were used wisely and soundly. and how much. in the opinion of the committee. was  used wisely and soundly.
. i have always understood that we should  refer to actions in the other body. in the course of trying to place facts before the members of this house i have refrained from doing that and i am  going to violate that rule at this time. even though reference has been made to a vote there and to an alleged attendance of "the entire membership" being present. other than to state flatly that neither assertion is correct. may i add that there was hing like unanimity of opinion in the other body on the essential amendment which i hope may be passed upon by the house. an amendment suggested by the bureau of the budget. which has the complete and wholehearted endorsement of the general accounting office. the comptroller general. the vice chairman of the civil aeronautics board. and also the endorsement of our colleague. the then chairman of the civil aeronautics board. hon. ross rizley. it is true two other members of the civil aeronautics board have supported this bill but. i submit. with very little persuasiveness. i do  intend to impose on the house here today with any detailed argument pro or con with reference to the bill. it is  13 minutes past 3 oclock. we came in this morning at 10 oclock. last night i sat on this floor and heard the statement made that this bill would be called up before any other legislative business. you k what the present situation is. i regret deeply there are  more members present to express their own convictions in the committee of the whole as to this particular measure. because. in my honest judgment. it is a windfall of the worst kind. it is discrimination on discrimination and if it is passed here over the protest of every department in the government. we will all live to regret that action. yet. considering the kind of a program we have had to face this week. certainly those who are  here  can be criticized fairly. i am sorry that there are only 30 minutes on each side to debate the complex and difficult issues in this matter. but perhaps that is  unusual. because if you will ask one of the boys to bring you the hearings on this bill you will find at the back end of a hearing labeled "civil air policy" there are a few pages devoted to this bill. if you examine those hearings and ask some questions. i do  think my colleagues on the subcommittee will dispute the fact that they were under certain pressure the morning of the hearing. i want to pay tribute to the gentleman from mississippi . yesterday he took this floor and admitted that the membership of this house voted on a bill without king what they were doing. he admitted that the amendment he offered had been hastily drawn. that the error had  been discovered at the time. and he said: i regret this mistake exceedingly. and. this is the significant thing i want to repeat to the few of you who are here at this time: and. while it illustrates the difficulty of legislating in this hurried fashion in these dying days of this congress. i must take full responsibility for the error. and. that is characteristic of that gentleman. he is willing to stand up and take the responsibility publicly for an unfortunate incident yesterday aftern. it is in the record of yesterday at page 14461. rollcall 119. 92 for and 299 against. and. he added: therefore. the vote just taken was  a fair test of the sentiments in this house on the publichousing question. we should. and i k we do. respect and ho that sort of complete honesty which always characterizes the gentlemans conduct here. even when we disagree with him on an issue before us. i submit to you that on this matter which does  have the support officially of a single agency of the federal government but has the active opposition of people who have wide experience. who have established reputations of competency. who k what they are talking about should receive something more than 30 minutes consideration on a side. particularly when i happen to be the only one from the committee. as far as i k. who is going to speak in opposition to this bill and to this rule. i assume my colleagues and my friends on the committee will want all their time. and they should have it. but surely who have a right to k the reasons for opposition. this is  a pleasant position i have this aftern. i do  enjoy it. i would infinitely rather prefer to have avoided coming to the floor and taking issue on this matter. but i can escape that duty and i will  try to do so. i do  care whether there are 1. 2. 3. 5. 10. or 50 people on this floor who may vote in opposition to this proposal or for the amendment i want to submit to you. . if a point of order is made. possibly it will  be before you. but i shall offer it. i think we have as much right to consider a serious suggestion of the bureau of the budget as to this kind of a bill. divorced from technicalities. as the other body has. there are a lot more things i wish i had time to say about this bill. but we are confronted with a strict time limitation. while i think that is most unfortunate. we must do the best we can to understand the issues pro and con and the clear. cold facts. if we can do that. this bill will  pass here.
that opinion. of course. is completely contrary to the chairman of the cab. who says that the board has estimated that it will amount to $46.487.000 in fiscal 1957. this bill will substantially increase the amount of the subsidy.
 heselton ed in 1956. mr. mora i appreciate the genaber of the tlemans statement concerning pan een broken americans capital gains. but i do  y when the see why we should discriminate against place that a company because it has grown large 11 attention and happens to be one of the biggest airan ameri- lines. gains from mr. heselton. i understand the 56. $3.505.- gentlemans position. i do  want to i. discriminate against anybody. i want to make certain that this is fair legislation bill by the and that it treats everybody properly. raised as to particularly the taxpayers of this ve to janu- country. 2. and spa- we have had a great deal of talk here )active date eral airlines this year about the tax burden. there has as  avail- been much concern as to whether we ng informs- could reduce that tax burden. one of the he commit- ways to reduce it would be through seeing there is unwarranted special ind carriers terest legislation passed by us in connection with anybody. i do  care wheth$212.000 er that interest is big or little.
 did any of these changes in the conference report in the opinion of the chairman remove the objections of the treasury department. the department of commerce or the bureau of the budget to this legislation.
i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed at this time to the consideration of calendar  944. house bill 5558. which has to do with the increase in the motorvehiclefuel tax in the district of columbia.
that is entirely satisfactory to me. the only importance of early action on the bill is that the tax is -to go into effect on the 1st day of january 1942. and the amendment has yet to be acted upon by the house.
. yesterday aftern. when the senate took the recess it was considering house bill 5558. i desire to state briefly the status of the bill and its effect. the bill as it is before the senate. including the three committee amendments agreed to yesterday. provides for an increase in the district gasoline tax. which at present is 2 cents. to 3 cents per gallon from january 1. 1942. for 9/2 years. through june 30. 1951. to cover the highway development program of the districtas presented. that increase will produce one and onehalf million dollars a yeat. in the opinion of the district committee. that is sufficient to meet the needs of the program. and any larger tax is  necessary at this time. i will state briefly the history of the bill. as introduced in the house. the bill provided for a 1cent increase per gallon. the district committee of the house recommended a 1cent increase per gallon. but when the house passed the bill it raised the tax by a 2cent increase per gallon. making the tax a 4cent tax instead of the present 2cent tax. the senate committee  concurs with the house committee. and says that a 1cent increase at this time under these conditions is adequate. and that is what is before the senate in the bill as  amended. with the committee amendments. i may point out that this tax is. of course. in addition to the federal 11/2cent tax. which applies throughout the -country. while i believe the issue should be determined on the basis of the needs of the district. the question is constantly asked as to what the taxes of other states are. therefore. i will state them briefly for the information of the*senate. the tax in maryland is 4 cents a -gallon. the tax in virginia is 5 cents a gallon. there is one state in the union that has a 2cent tax. there are10 states that have a tax of 3 cents. as this bill would make the tax in the district of columbia. there are 17 states that have a tax of 4 cents. 11 that have a tax of 5 cents. 5 that have a tax of 6 cents. i that has a tax of 6 cents. and 3 that have a tax of 7 cents.
it might be argued that if we were in a condition of peace. when there were priorities involved. and if we were in a condition where there were other great taxes being thrust upon our taxpayers. we should advocate a 2cent increase. and complete this program in 8 years. but under present conditions i think it is perfectly clear that the municipalities and the nation owe it to the nation to defer. where possible. their defense items. so far as they can defer them. and insofar as priorities are  involved in them. municipalities also owe it to the nation to keep taxes for their local purposes as low as possible. so that their citizens may be better able to pay the defense taxes that are being forced upon them at the same time. that is what we are proposing to accomplish by holding this increase down to an increase of 1 cent per gallon. i may add that what has taken place in the last year here in the district and in virginia is of importance when we are passing on the matter as it stands before us. within the last few months there have been located on the virginia side of the river war department and navy department buildings.
i wanted to remind the senator that the table. carried in the report of the committee on the district of columbia. of which the senator is a member. emphasizes the fact that since 1937 there has been contribution whatever from the general fund. and practically e since 1934. with the addition of one and onehalf million dollarswhich.willbe. added tothe.gasolinei tax fund from the proposed:increase of.1 cent. per gallon in the.tax. does the senator still feel that there would be a danger or likelihood that the general fund of the united states would be called upon to -subsidize the district.
i do  quite follow the last argument of the senator. as i understand the present situation in the area outside the district of columbia to which the senator refers. the gasoline companies themselves are refunding something like $1.000.000 for every cent of difference in the tax. therefore. if we should raise the tax within the district. such action would benefit the public within the district. but insofar as the area outside the district is concerned. if we should raise the gasoline tax in the .district. such action would then simply place additional money in the hands of the oil companies. to increase the tax in the district would benefit the oil companies outside the district without benefiting the public outside the district.
i believe the senator from michigan overlooks the fact that such bonds are sold in the open market. and when a person buys such a bond he buys it at a tremendously low rate of interest and thereby indirectly pays a tax to the local community. or he buys it at a premium and thereby pays the equivalent of a tax to the issuer of the bond.
let me say to the senator that the thing he should be talking about is something he is  talking about at allthe taxation of outstanding taxexempt securities. during the period of the war only a small number of state and municipal securities have been issuedand  to exceed $3.000.000 or $5.000.000 in federal income taxes can be derived from them.
let me point out to the senator the moral obligation that exists as to future issues. i believe that their taxation would be a blow to the very foundation of local government in america. to tax income from these future issues is to subject all local communities to greater interest costs on their securities. and ultimately it will place those costs on the persons receiving small incomes. we should  upset or destroy our local governments.
in proportion to the extent to which they could absorb them and use them properly. they do  buy them for tax evasion. they buy them because they want them in their portfolios. that same. situation would exist and  be greatly affected by this action. they still would buy large quantities of them.
the vested interests include also the many holders of small properties. i do  believe that the majority of real estate taxes in cleveland are paid by wealthy people. they are paid by everybody who owns property there. the thing we try to guard against all the time is the regressive effect of taxes imposed at equal rates upon the little fellow as well as the big fellow.
if he is a realestate owner. large or small. he does  have to pay an increase in his tax to meet an increase in his state or city bond interest that would have to be added to pay the bondholders income tax on the interest.
the report to which the senator from michigan referred was a report of a committee to the convention. the convention did  adopt that report on that point. but even that committee. i think. in its report. advocated only procedure by a constitutional amendment. the committee. of wh:ch the senator from michigan was chairman. which made an investigation some tine ago of this matter. reported to the senate a measure providing for taxation of state taxexempt securities. i believe the senator said. by a vote of 4 to 2. but when the measure came before the senate. the senate itself voted against such taxation by a vote of 44 to 30.
what i fear is that it may be claimed that if the commission had $6.000.000 it could put more persons to work on it  and complete the job within the fiscal year. if it has only $5.000.000. that fact may be used as an excuse for  completing the job. i do  want to be a party to any delay in having the report completed.
let me say. as the senator from nevada has said. that an argument can always be made that the cost of living in the district of columbia is a little higher than it is elsewhere. but it is so little higher that i do  believe it justifies any such discrepancy as would exist under the committee bill. as compared with the cost of living in most comparable cities. the cost of living in the district of columbia is less than 10 percent higher. therefore. that situation would justify at the most an increase of 10 percent in the 10percent bonus. or an additional 1 percent. there is justification for a 50percent increase in cost to the district of columbia. such as would be brought about by the committee bill.
it was the purpose of the committee to study particularly what might be the influence of the proposed legislation on the person receiving a small amount of pay. it seemed clear that the cost of living had gone up for that person as well as others. and it was believed that there should be some adjustment made in the light of that situation. particularly in view of the fact that there had been increases in pay provided for other employees in the governmental service and in comparable services throughout the country. in the case of the civilservice employee who does  work overtime. in contrast with the bill passed by the house a few days ago the pending amendment would allow a $300 flat payment to each employee whether he is receiving $1.440 or $1.620 a year. if he should work overtime. he would then receive a minimum of $300. i do  think the bill can be regarded as inflationary. and therefore subject to criticism. because it would increase the present rate of pay for all substantial purposes throughout the government service since the 1st of last december. it will be remembered that the increase granted at that time was only an approximate adjustment to the extent that all federal employees were below the level to which it was proposed to raise them. and the increase did  put them above that level whatever.
i refer to the testimony of admiral land. found on page 152 of the senate committee hearings. where he is reported to have said: the budget estimate as submitted by the president contemplated an increase in the administrative expense limitation of $4.950.000. this estimate was based on a broad overall. plan calling for about 5.000 men by the end of the fiscal year.
. i send to the desk an amendment to house bill 3687. and ask that it be printed and lie on the table. with the intention of offering it later to the pending tax bill. the amendment relates to the credit on the excessprofits tax. and i believe it to be necessary in order to make the amendment proposed by the committee thoroughly consistent.
i understand that to mean that in a tax return made say in march 1944. an examination might be made into preceding years. 1939. 1940. 1941. 1942. and 1943. however. there would be deficiency assessed for those years. matter what the situation might be. but there might be a tax assessed beginning with the year 1944.
i thank the senator from kansas for his statement. which is precisely what i wished to emphasize. if there is to be any modification of this figure from the $25.000.000 adopted by the house it will be necessary for the senate to insert some other figure in order that it may go to the conference committee for consideration. i served as a member of the subcommittee and of the full committee on appropriations. and one called attention to these matters. i wish to point out that neither in the house  in the senate hearings did representatives of the states testify on this issue. they did  present their full case. only within the past hour i received a telephone call from the superintendent of unemployment insurance of the state of ohio emphasizing the fact that to his surprise the figure had been reduced to $25.000.000. whereas $31.000.000 was less than the amount actually spent during the past year. he stated that it would be absolutely necessary for the states to carry on their work as they are doing it . i told him that when we voted in the committee to retain the house figure it was done with the assurance and with the belief that the difference could be covered by a deficiency appropriation. he stated that although there may be some question as to what will be required for the postwar period. there is question as to what is required to take care of current needs. it may be possible to take care of the funds for postwar planning by a deficiency bill later in the fiscal year. but the current needs require the appropriation of $31.000.000 . i wish to point out that this item of $31.000.000 represents money which is to go to the states for the administration of unemployment compensation insurance. an amount of approximately $60.000.000 is to be distributed to beneficiaries. $1.000.000.000 is to be collected from those who are required to make payments. and a backl6g of about $5.000.000.000 is involved. it is a threeway operation. the operation consists of payments to beneficiaries which. as the senator from tennessee has pointed out. is  a large operation. involving approximately only $60.000.000 in these days of full employment. therefore. if the entire $25.000.000 or $31.000.000 were required in order to distribute $60.000.000 to beneficiaries. it would seem to be an exorbitant appropriation. but even in these days of full employment there is seen aher side of the picture. of course. there is a small amount of disbursement for unemployment. there is a great amount of expenditure in connection with necessary administration in collecting and keeping track of the money and posting the payments which are received from employees in time of full employment. it is pointed out that the sum which is involved. $31.000.000. comes well within the funds collected for this purpose by the government. it is $4.300.000 less than the appropriation for this year and $2.300.000 less than the actual expenses for this year. therefore. i believe the senate would be wise to restore the figure to $31.000.000. which is the figure. as i understand. recommended by the bureau of the budget. and thus allow the item to go to conference where the conferees may take into consideration the arguments which are . for the first time. coming in from many states directly involved in the consideration of this issue. the conferees. therefore. will be able to decide between the $25.000.000 and the $31.000.000. if it is  done in that way. the issue will be foreclosed. and. to use the words of . those who believe in retaining and strengthening the state agencies should  vote to make the figure $31.000.000.
he could be drafted under the house bill. whereas the bill recommended by the senate committee would authorize a ceiling to be placed on employment in certain industries. and if such a ceiling were placed on an industry there would be an elimination of certain men from that industry. and those men when eliminated by the employing agencies would be without jobs until they got other jobs.
i wish to express my appreciation of the presentation that the senator from alabama hag been making of the fundamental arguments involved in connection with the pending bill. it was considered in the committee on military affairs. and. as :. recall. the fundamental argument which impressed me thereand i wish to press further the question to the senatorwas this: realizing the full necessity of giving these young men the best possible training. and adequate training for the respective jobs they will have to do. the question is. would an act of congress contribute to the clarifying of that policy. or would an act of congress really handicap the policy. i wish to ask. suppose this amendment were adopted that a man should be given 6 months military training. would it be possible for congress in any way to assure that the kind of military training received would be of benefit to him under the circumstances he would finally face..
. just a few words in concluding the argument in opposition to the amendment. as has been pointed out. it involves the expenditureat a later date. to be sure. but based upon the plans  sought to be authorizedof about $75.000.000 of government money to build transmission lines and a steam plant. which are  needed. because a private company is in a position to supply the same service. in these days. when the taxpayer is burdened with federal taxes and the government is confronted by a huge national debt. if we have a chance to avoid payment from the federal treasury of $75.000.000. we should take advantage of the opportunity. and this is a good place to do that. the money asked for is  needed. the people will be supplied with this power. and it will be supplied at fair rates under the regulation of their state utilities commission. therefore i believe the house was entirely right when it concluded that this is a good place to start the ecoy program. and  to spend $75.000.000 of public money to duplicate a private investment. in the second place. it has been pointed out that possibly if the governmen constructs these transmission lines. the consumer in california might be able to receive his power at a slightly lower rate than he would receive it from the private company. that means that the consumer in california will be paying a lower rate because the taxpayers of the united states endow him with transmission lines which enable him to enjoy benefit. i believe that our government is based on the principle that we are willing to have private capital obtain a fair return. we are willing that a fair return be paid for expenses incurred. we are willing to have services supplied by private industry when private industry can and will supply them. in this case private industry can and will supply the service and supply it at fair rates. determined by the public utility regulating body of california. there is need. therefore. of appropriating $75.000.000. contributed by all the taxpayers of the united states. in order- to give power consumers of this particular area of california a lower rate than they would be entitled to. or that other consumers throughout the united states would pay. it it were true that this area could  be irrigated. if it were true that it could  be developed. if it were true that the power were  available without this government line. then the investment might be justified. but that is  the case. there is need for $75.000.000 of public money being spent in order to provide a lower rate for california users than is being paid for comparable services elsewhere in the united states.-
. this bill seems to be a good bill. and i hope it will receive strong support and be passed by the committee. the first thing i want to talk about very briefly is the figure of 181/2 percent. that figure on top of the average increase of 15.9 percent given last year means a total increase of a little over 34 percent. an increase of a little more than 34 percent in salaries that have remained the same since 1930. it compares with an increase. according to the bureau of labor statistics. in the cost of living of something over 33 percent since 1941. it is justified both as a measure for meeting the increased cost of living since 1941. and also because salary increase has been granted since 1930. therefore. privateindustry salaries and wages for comparable jobs have become higher than those in the federal service. we are trying in a way to equalize. perhaps  entirely equalize. but come more to the point where the government will approximate private salaries for similar jobs. if we should take 17 percent instead of 181/2 percent as the figure. which i think would  be justified as this is. the saving would only be $34.000.000. it seems to me that this does  justify doing a job which is  a complete job. i believe. too. that a flat increase of 181/. percent is better than an increase of the sort that the gentleman from kansas has suggested. or the one adopted by the senate. last july we did proceed on the basis of a graduated increase because what we were trying to do then was to make a little more tolerable the situation of the lowerpaid employees. at this time we are proceeding on a permanent basis. we are proceeding on" sounder ground. we are giving a flat increase applicable to all salary grades. which i think is the more important job to do. we should  in the federal service pay people just egh to live on in any salary group. we should improve the compensation for the people who are the real backbone of the federal service. the people in administrative jobs. the people in supervisory jobs. the people who really run the government. we should  any longer suffer them to have much less than people in comparable service in private industry receive. thqt is biting off our e to spite our face.
i agree with the gentleman on the need and the vital need for balancing the federal budget and reducing our debt. mr. h. carl andersen. but the gentleman has  answered my question. how will this bill aid in accomplishing that object.
had been appointed a manager on the part of the house at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the amendment of the senate to the bill for the relief of harriet townsend bottomley. vice mr. springer. deceased. the message annced that the house had agreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the amendments of the senate to the bill making appropriations for the executive office and sundry independent executive bureaus. boards. commission. and offices. for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1949. and for other purposes. that the house had receded from its disagreement to the amendments of the senate . 13 and 17 to the bill. and concurred therein. and that the house receded from its disagreement to the amendment of the senate  1 to the bill. and concurred therein with an amendment. in which it requested the concurrence of the senate.
i fully agree. the question arises. why do you  let the cities and states provide this assistance. the answer is that the cities and the states are  able to meet this problem. it is perfectly true that all money that the federal government raises comes from people who live in cities and in states. but the cities and states can get that money. there are several reasons why this is so. one is that in many states the urban centers are inadequately represented in the state legislatures. aher. more important reason is. the competition between the states to keep their tax rates low. the problem of competition between the states in the matter of tax rates lest they lose residents and business enterprises is a vital one. we are all interested in the proposed commission on intergovernmental relations which is soon to be considered by the other body. perhaps it may find the perfect answer to this problem. but i do  think it can be solved merely by a better division of revenue sources between the states themselves or between the states and the federal government. i doubt whether the problem can be solved without some use of the federal taxing power and. thus far at least. one has suggested a better solution than the system of federal grantsinaid. the opponents of this bill raise two fundamental objections. the first. that of the federal debt and the federal finances. and the second the danger of socialism. on the first score we must take into consideration the costs that we are already paying. .visible and invisible. due to the absence of decent housing for millions of our people. the cost is large. indeed. but considering the benefits gained it is my honest belief that it is  too large a program for a country such as the united states to undertake. as to the question of socialism. of course. this is what it is. the government would be aiding in the clearance of slums and in the creation of lowcost housing. and in the subsidization of people who can afford to pay ecoic rent. that is what it is. i do  think we have to worry about name calling or who is for it or who is against it.
. i shall oppose this gag rule because i am convinced that the resolution which it will make in order will be followed by others of the same nature and that the effect will be to nullify the efforts of the house to reduce essential expenditures of the federal government in the coming fiscal year. most emphatically. however. my vote does  mean that i favor or would support "ripper" amendments or amenciments to cripple foreignaid or any other program essential to our national defense or the effective operation of a sound foreign policy. and i am convinced that the great majority of those who oppose this resolution feel exactly as i do about this matter.
this is a memorandum concerning amortization of emergency facilities. under section 124a of the internal revenue code. dated march 1. 1951. issued from the office of the administrator of the defense production administration. on page 13. it reads as follows: "in determining the percentage of certificatton allowed on facilities which are determined to be necessary. some factors which may or may  be specifically covered by the regulations are to be considered: "a. mal rates of depreciation. "b. location" (pp. 584586). the applicable regulation provides as follows:
but certainly that is one. i am sure that certain tax amendments and other provisionsperhaps  all of them statutory in naturedealing with the relationships between our government and the people of the other countries and the countries themselves. in both official and uficial ways. and contacts which can be extremely helpful in strengthening the position of american private investments in such countries. will eventually. i hope. together with private investments from the outside. be able to carry the entire load. although i am sure that is  possible at the present time.
. amount of talk can erase the picture of registration irregularities and extralegal procedures which the attorney general and others have described to the committees of congress. statistics bearing upon the negros voting rights have been compiled by the southein regional council for eight southern states and by gover coleman of mississippi for his own state. their combined figures reveal that more than 75 percent of the potential white voters in these 9 states did  even get on the registration rolls. those who did succeed in registering were still required. in five southern states. to pay a poll tax before they could vote. according to gover colemans testimony before the house judiciary committee. only 22.000 negroes of an eligible negro population just under half a million were actually registered and of these only 8.000 had paid the poll taxes and were able to vote. put next to this the view of gover coleman as quoted in the mississippi press: i do   favor the negro voting in mississippi. he is wholly unprepared to assume this responsibility. and then consider the words of the 15th amendment: section 1. the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall  be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race. color. or previous condition of servitude. sec. 2. the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. the national government. including the congress. has a constitutional responsibility to see that every american. whatever the accident of his birth. may choose his governmental representatives. h. r. 6127 provides a reasonable means toward this end. the senate should move immediately toward its consideration.
 recognizes the problem. and he has made several specific recommendations this weekend. in addition to those he has previously made. we heartily concur in his objectives. and add our own suggestions for specific and immediate action. alleviating conditions caused by the recession is the joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches. we must shoulder our portion of the responsibility.
the states have had a long time to come up to this standard. and they have  done so. every state is in competition with every other state to keep taxes low and offer attractions to business. unless we have a federal standard. the various states will continue to have low wage rates and low taxes for the purpose of attracting business from the high wage and high tax areas.
i appreciate the enthusiasm and the buoyancy of the senator from indiana and his contribution to any debate. sometimes it is a little difficult to get a word in edgewise. but that represents loss when the comparison is made between his comments and mine. there is a difference in taxes as between the various states. there is a difference in the amount of credit given to employers for experience. so the problem is  quite so easy as the senator from indiana suggests.
. 10 years ago the new state of israel was proclaimed. minutes after the declaration of a new independent nation. the united states annced formal recognition of its government. the lone democracy in the ancient lands of the middle east. the years since then have brought development at a pace unmatched by any other nation in modern times. certainly. few have confronted greater difficulties in their initial years. a barren land which would require emous effort to make productive. the mal sources of food supply largely cut off. a steady influx of immigrants and refugees. most of them with little or agricultural experience. little industry. hostile neighbors on virtually every sidelittle wonder that some thought israel would  long survive. but israel had one priceless asseta people firmly determined to build a strong and enduring nation. in which each could make a useful life. indeed. the very precariousness of those early years. the hardships and dangers that were a part of daily life. stimulated efforts that were truly prodigious. in 10 years israel has come a very long way. primary emphasis has. of course. been put on the development of agriculture. this has meant investment in irrigation. agricultural equipment. fertilizers. and training programs. israel is  yet selfsufficient in all foods. but the days of strict rationing. of barely skirting the threat of starvation. are behind. forever behind. we hope. even though wisdom and necessity dictated giving agricultural development first place. industrial growth has also proceeded at a rapid rate. over an 8year period. israel has managed to achieve a fivefold increase in exports and to meet her financial obligations at home and abroad. overall imports still exceed exports. but the young ecoy has demonstrated a vitality and capacity for growth that is from any objective point of view. very .remarkable. in all of this. israel has been greatly helped by the assistancetechnical. financial. and ecoicextended by other nations and by millions of individuals.  only in the united states. but all over the world. to whom the establishment of israel was the triumphant vindication of basic principles of humanity and justice. to see the good use to which outside help has been put. the manyfold return it has so quickly brought. provides a rare satisfaction. important though outside assistance has been. and will continue to be for some time. the indispensable ingredient in israels progress remains her people. only a people with a high degree of social responsibility. with the ability to organize themselves effectively and make the most of meager resources. could achieve a standard of living which already contrasts so favorably with that of many of her neighbors. including those endowed with great natural resources. much of the hardest part is behind them. but new and less challenging problems lie ahead. domestically most important is that of helping many of the new immigrants coming from traditional. almost feudal backgrounds of middle eastern countries. to take their places in a modern dynamic society shaped by and dedicated to western ideals. i have fear of the outcome. a people who have demonstrated the courage and skill which has brought israel through this first decade can fail to meet the new challenges which lie ahead.
this is a matter which has been brought to my attention as being of serious concern to important segments of the industry in new jersey. the statement has been made that this provision would be a serious deterrent to the efficiency and ecoical conduct of the operations of that industry. it does  involve much in the way of additional revenue to the transportation industry. i am here expressing for my constituentsand i believe the same consideration applies to the constituents of a number of other senators who are   present. i believe the senator from texas and other senators have an interesttheir concern over the situation. i wonder if there is a possibility that the committee might consider an amendmentand one has been submitted by the senator from maryland -to strike that language and leave in. as exempt. frozen fruits. frozen berries. and frozen vegetables. i do  possess the same degree of eloquence as does the senator from massachusetts . who has spoken in regard to the products of the sea. however. i have the same deep feeling in regard to the products of the soil included in this bill. and i think they should be treated in the same way. because the same conditions applythe need for flexibility of transportation. speed. and so forth. it is  a matter of significance to the transportation industry. as i have been informally advised by several in the industry with whom i have talked.
i thank the senator. the senator is correct about the size of the increase in the cost of living since 1954. it is roughly 8 percent. the increase in the general standard of living. as measured by increased wage rates in the country since that time. is about 12 percent. a 10 percent increase in benefits is more than fair insofar as it would represent an opportunity for our older citizens to share. partially. in the general rise in the standard of living. as well as to meet the cost incident to the increase in the cost of living since that time. the senator is also correct in regard to the question of financing the amendment. the increase in the wage base from $4.200 to $4.800. plus the acceleration of already scheduled increases in tax rates. provided by the house bill and by the senate committee amendment. will more than take care of the 10percent increase in benefits. we were assured earlier this year by the trustees of the social security trust fund that the fund is solvent under existing law.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the wage tax protest league of new jersey opposing the adoption of legislation to require various government agencies to deduct municipal taxes or any federal taxes from the salaries of federal employees.
. too often men in public life are taken at the value they place upon themselves publicly. in the case of secretary herter we find a refreshing exception. this is a man whose gentleness and consideration for others may have led some to think of him as a person somewhat lacking in firmness. or in that degree of selfconfidence which someone in a position so difficult and important as the one he is about to undertake must have. any such judgment would be a gross mistake. i am sure that one who ks christian herter will ever for a moment make it. like so many of my colleagues in the senate. i served with him for a number of years in the house. our offices were adjoining for most of that time. our friendship was close. as was our association in the work of the house of representatives. all that history need  be repeated. it has been gone into in detail. as it should have been. this is a man whose upbringing and whose whole adult life seem to have been directed to the job which he  undertakes. as we wish him well. all of us who k him so well are happy that he is to succeed aher great american in one of the most difficult jobs in the world today.
i join with the senior senator from new hampshire in complimenting the junior senator from new hampshire on the excellent statement he has made and upon the very sound position he has taken. it seems to me to be very clear that the junior senator from new hampshire. in the words of his senior colleague. is  only representing the interests of his own state well. but also the national interest. i ask the junior senator from new hampshire how anyone can claim that it is in the national interest for the federal government to be a party to imposing upon a state a kind of taxation it does  want.
s committee on education beyond the high school. and by numerous other outstanding educational authorities. the 2year colleges cost less to build. since they do  require expensivedormitories or elaborate eating and recreational facilities. for the students they provide the ecoic advantages of living at home. and the possibility for parttime jobs in the hometowns. the end result is a much smaller drain on the family pocketbook. if we are truly concerned about strengthening the nation. we must be prepared to finance adequately our educational program. good education is expensive. but it is essential to realizing fully our national greatness and our aspirations for the dignity of the individual.
. first i should like to say that i am thoroughly in accord with the purposes of the provisions of h.r. 8229. reported by the committee. and i intend to support it. my amendment to that bill does  relate to its provisions but. rather. would add a new section to the bill. section 7. which would grant for any taxable year beginning before july 1. 1961. income tax exemption under section 501 (c) (3) of the internal revenue code to any nurses registry organization or association. there are a number of such organizations in new jersey and elsewhere. in fact. i am informed that throughout the country there are 172 professional nurses registries. most of which are operated and organized on the same basis as the camden nurses registry. by districts of state professional nurses associations. for many years. under the 1954 internal revenue code. these organizations have been treated as tax exempt. however. following an audit of the camden nurses registry. in ember 1959. a recommendation was made that the tax exemption be denied. on the ground that the camden association was primarily engaged in a regular business of the kind ordinarily carried on for profit. and was performing a particular service for individual persons. rather than working to improve business conditions of one or more lines of business. that recommendation was reviewed by the internal revenue service. and within recent weeks the service denied. after review. this exemption. i am  asking that this question be permanently settled. what i am asking is that nurses registries of the type that we have in camden and in other places in new jersey. as well as throughout the united states. be permitted to continue the exemption under section 501(c) (3) of the internal revenue code for tax years beginning before july 1. 1961. in order that they may continue their operations as taxexempt organizations. so that. if it is necessary to change the way in which they operate. they can do it without ceasing their service to the public while this effort to change is going on. the main purpose of a nurses registry association is to provide service to the public. this is emphasized over and over again  only by the nurses but by hospital associations and by many of my constituents. who have been in touch with me about this particular matter. i ask unanimous consent to insert in the record at this point a table showing the number of nurses professional registries number of calls. by states and territories in 1957.
i do  k whether a report was made. but. as the chairman ks. i have a letter from the director of the tax ruling division of the internal revenue service as to its position. as i said in my remarks earlier. the position of the service is that such organizations are  to be treated as tax exempt. i am  aware whether a formal report on the bill. as such. was made. we are  asking for a permanent exemption. all we are asking is that the exemption be continued for 1 year.
i refer the senator to page 32. lines 6 to 9. of his amendment. which reads: all es. debentures. and other obligations of the corporation shall be exempt. both as to principal and interest. from all taxation imposed by the united states. or any states. county. municipality. or local taxing authority. i take it that means exempt from taxes in the nature of taxes on these obligations as property.
i think the responsibility is a double responsibility. in the first place. the administration ought  to give up with the failure of cloture on the two votes. but ought to press for effective legislation and use all of its powers of leadership and persuasion with members of this body and of the other body in order to accomplish effective legislation at this session. but beyond that. and more particularly in response to the question of my colleague from new york. i think. as he suggested earlier. that the administration should make a massive effort through the courts and through the administrative machinery available to it. including the civil rights commission. in order to correct the situation on an individual casebycase. districtbydistrict. and countybycounty basis so far as it can be corrected through the methods open to it. for that purpose it ought to come to us and ask whatever it needs in the way of funds for the coming fiscal year to make that kind of effort. unless it does both of those things. i think it will have done much less than would be indicated by recognition of the seriousness of the problem.
i thank the senator for his generous remarks and his interest. i k of his own interest in improving the procedures. it could  be otherwise. it seems to me. i wonder if the majority leader thinks there will be any time to do it between  and the time when the senate receives the first controversial measures. of which perhaps the tax bill is one. and of which the civil rights bill certainly is one. does the majority leader think we could dispose of this matter. which is relatively controversial. before that time.
i should be very glad to have any illumination the senator from louisiana cares to provide as to what the figures actually show for the southern states. the senator. with his usual fairness. i am sure would be glad to tell us about his state and other parts of the country. in my state of new jersey there are various kinds of employment and various kinds of activities. but we do  have farmwork of the type and extent found in the south. i am sure the reason why there is a difference between the negro unemployment rate in the south and some thern states is that in the south the negroes live largely on farms and are  in the labor market looking for jobs of the kind which are the chief source of their employment in the th. for example. it is my understanding that white collar jobs in the south represent only 8.3 percent.
i believe it depends on who does the reaching. i am sure the senator and i could stand here enjoying ourselves in a friendly discussion until .kingdom come. without agreeing with each other. . seventyfive percent of the negroes. as i pointed out in my remarks in chief. have. jobs in the unskilled area and blue collars jobs and in service. and onfy 25 percent in white collar jobs and on farms. april .8 1964 col they are  qualified to take the other jobs. which are the only jobs which. in the thern states. might be available to them. the number of such jobs is limited. that is clearly the reason. i do  say we do  discriminate in the th. we have our problems with respect to seniority in jobs and employment rules. and everything else. i believe the senator understands the situation.
again. .. i have desire to try to overprove anything or to distort the meaning of figures. i do  regard this particular table as emously significant. because we do  k the composition of the group involved or where the jobs are. however. in our colloquy i endeavoredand i found the senator from louisiana at least reasonably perceptive and willing to give consideration to the actual facts. as opposed to trying to make debating points--to state that all agree that the applicable figures show an increasing problem in thern states. such as new jersey. as compared with southern states. because of the.constant migration of negroes--one and a half million in the 1950sfrom the southern states into the thern statesa continuing phee in recent years.
i do  have any disagreement with the senator from vermont or the senator from rhode island. the proponents of this title feel that tax money raised from all people alike regardless of color should be spent for the benefit of all people alike. regardless of color. with respect to the question which the senator raises. as to how this problem can be worked out within a state. and within a program within a state. it seems to me that that problem can be solved. if the language in the title. as supplemented and interpreted. for example. by the statement inserted in the record on friday by the senator from minnesota. is  adequate. i believe we should bend our efforts to make the language more explicit and clearer. my own interpretation. in layman language. is that perhaps funds could be withheld from a program at whatever level the responsibility for the administration of the program exists. it might be possible that a whole state could be guilty. as suggested by the senator from vermont. if a state officer is guilty. i do  see any alternative. if we adopt this principle. to having the money withheld from the whole state program. we must be careful that we do  in effect punish people who are  responsible for the action of others. i do  believe we are far apart in substance.
that is certainly a satisfactory answer to both of us. for example i sponsored the effort of the senator from arkansas for a joint committee on the budget and matters of that kind. i am very glad to have that assurance.
therefore. the question is  whether we shall hurt chances of passage of the bill. because we will pass that bill. let us make it the best possible bill that we can. the question is: should the kennedy amendment be adopted on its merits. the miity leader saysand one seriously disagrees that i have heardthat the poll tax as a precondition for voting has been used and is  being used as an instrument for discrimination. i say that under the 15th amendment. there is question as to the propriety of enacting the bill to eliminate the poll tax as a precondition for voting. i hope very much that the senate will do so.
that was our language. that language is clear that all future budget estimates would be presented to the appropriations committee only on the basis of specific authorizations for those programs from the senators committee.
i associate myself with the senator from new york in his amendment. he has stated in a measured and sensitive way precisely what should be said here. and precisely what should  have been necessary to debate. like him. i do  understand the blind spot of the administration on this point. this extraordinarily able leader. sargent shriver. is being rendered about 5 percent as effective as he could be if he were permitted to administer only one of these two jobs. it is a shame that this was allowed to happen. each of these jobs requires a single. top man on a fulltime basis. perhaps on a more than fulltime basis. if that were possible. while it is utterly wrong for congress to try to conduct an operation. or to usurp in any way the prerogatives of the executive branch of the government. when something like this is so wrong and is being persisted in. i believe that congress has choice but to express an opinion. i am therefore glad to join in supporting the amendment of the senator from new york.
. i was unavoidably absent during consideration of the foreign investors tax act and was therefore unable to express my position on the amendments offered to that bill. had i been present. i would have voted "nay" on the three amendments offered by senator williams of delaware to strike various portions of the bill. 296. 297. 298. "nay" on senator hartkes amendment regarding sewer pipe clay 299. "yea" on senator hartkes amendment to incorporate provisions of h.r. 10 in the bill 300. "yea" on senator yarboroughs amendment concerning deposits of resident aliens 301. and "yea" on final passage 302.
i would feel the senator would never find the matter questioned. but i can conceive of circumstances in which a lawyer. let us say. would say. "all right. i will do this big job for you. i dont want any money. but can you put a like amount into my campaign fund. in that way i will  have to pay taxes on it."
indeed. i agree. the money for those campaign expenditures should be raised. frankly. recognizing that that is what they are. as the internal revenue people do  permit their deduction as expenses of an office. i would  permit them to be sanctioned for that purpose. the more i consider this. the clearer it seems to me that there should be two kinds of expensespolitical. and the actual expenses to run an office.  this inbetween thing for public relations. which is perfectly proper. hing wrong about it. but it should  be handled except as campaign expenditures. the money for it could be raised for that one purpose. recognizing that it will be received and expended for that purpose.
. it can be disputed that in our concern to meet the ecoic and social problems of the nation we have placed increasing reliance upon the federal budget and direct federal expenditures. the proliferation of federal programs and dollars has . however. disposed of our problems. and it seems to me that there is good reason to ask "how much can the federal budget do." as duncan k. foley does in the july issue of the ripon forum. i ask unanimous consent that mr. foleys perceptive article be printed in the record.
. as i understand itof course. i should like to be corrected if i am wrongthe effect of the 279.60 amendment would be retroactive to the first of this fiscal year. that is. july 1. 1968. is my understanding correct.
i am most grateful to my colleague. i take it that. while the senate chamber has  been completely filled. there have been a good many senators present during our discussion of these points. including the last point. and i take it that the general silence. except for the comments of the senator from new york on this point. suggests that one in this chamber is likely to attack any administrator under this program for  attempting to give the provision an ex post facto effect and application. i am relying very heavily on this and the other assurances that have been given by the senator from new york and the senator from rhode island. on the assurances of commonsense. and. i think. most of all on the fact pointed out by the senator from new york that this provision will have application only for the very brief period of this fiscal year.
. during last years debate on the military procurement authorization bill. the senator from minnesota and i raised some basic questions about the use of attack aircraft carriers and the proper size of the carrier fleet. as a result of this debate. an amendment was adopted requiring the creation of a joint housesenate armed services subcommittee to make a complete ana comprehensive study of the navys carrier program. on april 23. 1970. this subcommittee issued a report recommending the funding of a new attack carrierthe cvan 70in fiscal year 1971. this recommendation was made despite the fact that the subcommittee concluded that there is "as yet acceptable formula" for determining the relative costeffectiveness of seabased versus landbased tactical air power. and the recommendation was made despite the subcommittees admission that it was unable "to resolve the question of the number of carriers" needed by the end of the decade. senator mondale and i have already stated our objections to the subcommittees recommenation. we both believe that such a recommendation is unjustified in light of the subcommittees inability to answer the most fundamental questions concerning the carrier fleet. on april 8. 1970. senator mondale testified before this joint subcommittee. in his testimony. he raised some basic questions about the navys insistence on maintaining a 15carrier fleet and about the need to fund an additional carrier prior to fiscal year 1975. i ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in the record: first. senator mondales testimony of april 8. 1970. before the joint housesenate subcommittee on cvan70. second. the subcommittees report. third. senator mondales statement on that report.
. i should like to make a couple of points in rebuttal. the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking miity member have been extremely considerate to our concerns for these programs. i am most grateful. as evidenced by my appreciation of the action they took on my previous amendment. but the same principle is involved here. the smaller colleges will  be able to take advantage. under present conditions. of the interest subsidy program. so they must have loans and grants. the 4year small colleges need them just as much as the community colleges and technical institutions do. the $43 million we gave for community colleges and technical institutes i think represents admirable action on the part of the committee for that particular purpose. but for the fiscal year ending the end of this month. 1970. we appropriated $71 million for those programs. that is what my amendment would bring that appropriation to this yearthe same amount. that is $20 million less than the amount which was appropriated in fiscal 1969. there is one reason why i think the office of education led the committee to feel that this was unnecessary. when they were up here they said only $9 million had been obligated out of the total of $71 million appropriated. that was. of course. a correct figure at the time. but that was early in the spring. since then. the fact is that they have reported to us that the entire $71 million appropriated for 1970 will be obligated by the end of this month. the applications  on hand. .in addition to all previous appropriatlons. total more than $200 million. i hope that the senate will consider this a worthy amendment.
. questions were raised during last years debate on the tax reform bill as to whether private philanthropic foundations should continue to be granted tax exemption privileges. abundant evidence. i am glad to say. demonstrated the importance of continuing the work carried out by these great reservoirs of private initiative and skill. . . during that debate i pointed out that some 200 national and local foundations in new jersey were helping to meet local and statewide needs. particularly .in urban areas. while public attention is often focused on grants made by the large. wellkn foundations. it is e2 from progress beginswithf the child. excerpts from a statement by henry h. la-" bouisse. 17 december. 1968. . worthy that much significant work is being done by small local foundations one such foundation is the victoria foundation. which has granted more than $600.000 over the past 6 years to d evelop an inner city school in newark. n.j. the victoria project was recently described in an article in the newark evening news. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
 i think that the senate and the country are in the senators debt again. as they so often are in matters relating to his people. on these questions affecting israel and the jews. the very moderation and the very factual nature of the senators statement adds emously to its strength.  only in this country but i am sure throughout the world. including soviet russia. i am grateful indeed for the leadership that he has again given us in this matter. he is moderate in his statement but relentless in making the factual points that he has made and raising the questions that he has raised. which. by the weight of their rightness. will eventually demand an answer. and i believe help to bring about improvement. the senator has made an eloquent statement on the persecution of soviet jews. i share his deep concern. for many years. i have joined with senator javits and many other senators in protesting the reprehensible treatment of the soviet jews. through public appearances and resolutions. my colleagues and i have tried to put some measures of pressure on the soviets to change their policies. unfortunately. little result has been evident. yet we must continue our efforts. for it seems that the soviets will only alter their behavior when the onus of worldwide condemnation makes the political cost of  changing too great for the soviets to bear. thus. i urge my colleagues here in the senate. along with all other americans. to make their voices heard in condemning the persecution of soviet jews. such conduct has place in the civilized world.
and the senate very wisely. i think. eliminated from the appropriation bill any ceilings on expenditure and obligations for the current fiscal year. the year to which the appropriation bill relates. so we went to conference with the house ceiling of $214 million and senate ceiling and a rough approximation of some $864 million as the amount the administration would like to commit in fiscal 1971. we tussled with the house for quite a while. they wanted to put in something like a $400 million or a $450 million ceiling. however. we broke for lunch and they came back refreshed. they had obviously been spoken to by people. so. we agreed on the far more preferable figure of $600 million for the balance of this year as the ceiling for this program. it is a good. solid amount. i hope that next year we get swinging to the point where we will  have a congressional ceiling but will be able to go along with the amount required to complete the program within its scheduled time. this was a good result. i thank my colleagues on the senate side for supporting the senate action. a matter in which my own state and area of the country is particularly interested. we have a special interest in the matter. my colleague. the junior senator from new jersey . was a chief sponsor of the bill which created the mass transit program in the current session of congress. so. both senators from new jersey are expressing their gratitude for this result. most of the rest of the matters speak for themselves. i shall  detain the senate long  with any statement at length of my views on the sst. as the senator ks. i voted against it in the senate. having opposed it in committee beforehand. several of us on the conference committee. though  a majority of the senate or house conferees. were in the same position. we opposed the sst. we talked about it. i think. as long as we reasonably could. and we arrived at a solution of which i do  approve. and yet i do  regard it as outside the ballpark as far as the action of the conference went. i do  think that the characterization of the senator from nevada of the senates original action as folly is entirely supportable. but again i think it is rhetoric that is permissible in debate.
. before the senator makes his request. i want to join him in expressing my interest in the serious consideration of this matter. beyond the question of the revenue loss is the question of what the senator has referred to as harassment and unnecessary anance and trouble. i think business is entitled to the serious consideration of such problems. i join with the senator in gratification that the chairman of the committee has given assurance that this matter will be fully considered.
. i am most pleased to join my colleagues in congress in hoing the disabled american veterans on the occasion of this organizations golden jubilee year. the theme selected for this day in congressa tribute to quiet courageexpresses the special debt of gratitude which we all owe to these men who have given so much to the service of this country. such a debt can be fulfilled by a simple ackledgment of sacrifices made. but rather represents an obligation on the part of all of us to insure that these veterans can live in the dignity and security which is their due. in this task. the dav serves a unique and invaluable function. although it brings together those who share a special bond. the dav is far more than a fraternal organization. the dav national service program to insure that disabled veterans and their families receive all the benefits to which they are entitled serves as a valuable adjunct to the federal veterans program that the veterans administration has accredited the dav to represent individual veteran claimants is testimony to the professionalism and worth of this program. in this and in other ways beyond number. the disabled american veterans organization has truly distinguished itself in its task of representing the cause of all veterans. i am indeed happy to be able to extend my most sincere congratulations.
. i am very glad to have received a letter from office of management and budget director george shultz stating that the department of agriculture  intends to fund all of the applications from cities and states for the 1971 summer child feeding program. in reply to a letter i sent to hir on july 2. cosigned by 44 other senators. mr. shultz stated that steps have been initiated by the office of management and budget to insure that the full benefits of the child feeding programs planned by cities and states this summer will be realized. i am gratified. as i k my colleagues are. that the administration reconsidered this matter and that millions of needy children will be fed this summer as congress intended and as the department of agriculture originally promised. i ask unanimous consent that the exchange of letters be printed in the record. i also ask that a survey of the kn volume of requests for summer feeding funds. conducted by representatives of the city of detroit in cooperation with the national league of citiesu.s. conference of mayors. be printed in the record. with respect to the survey. i would point out that it should  be considered as an exhaustive documentation of the needs of cities and states for summer lunch program funds. it is simply a listing of available u.s. department of agriculture data. supplemented by additional requests made kn to the league of cities and conference of mayors.
. although the senator from missouri and i are cosponsors of the amendment placing limitations on u.s. activities in cambodia. and although i fully respect his ho in fulfilling his commitment on raising the financial ceiling. i am under such obligation. i made such commitment. i fully support the action of the foreign relations committee in placing a $250 million ceiling on u.s. expenditures and a 200man u.s. personnel limitation in cambodia during this fiscal year. the $250 million figure represents roughly the current level of american assistance. i urge that we maintain the present rate while we are considering the question of what should be our future obligation and commitment to cambodia. two years ago we had aid programs at all in that country. and we spent our first $100 million without congressional approval. wholly on the basis of discretionary funds used by the administration. it is true that we later approved. in the 1970 supplemental appropriations bill. what the administration described as a modest level of assistance for cambodia. but last years level was considerably lower than this years request and i believe that we should go further than we did last year without a firm commitment from the congress and the american people that they desire a deeper involvement in cambodia. therefore. i urge the senate to turn down this proposed increase of $91 million in the cambodian aid ceiling.
. we have worked together on this matter without regard to party lines. and we will continue to do so. i thoroughly support the amendment. it is  a big item. yet it may save some companies from bankruptcy. some companies in the cities are attempting to reduce their services. which has led to a loss of revenue and a loss of patronage. but most of all to a loss of service to the people of our state. we must do all we can. and this is a step in the right direction.
. the social security system provides benefits for 91 percent of americas older people. the social security system covers the great majority of retired workers. and more than half of the retired workers in the nation rely solely on social security benefits. consequently. the social security benefit system is the most important ecoic factor in the lives of older citizens. i am supporting a 20percent increase in social security benefits so that the needs of older people can better be met. a 20percent increase. along with the other changes in the social security benefits  contemplated. would raise the minimum monthly benefit from $70.40 to $84.50. it would increase the benefits for widows from $114 per month to $153 per month. benefits to retired couples would be increased from $222 per month to $269 per month. and benefits to single retired workers would be increased from $133 to $162. more people will be able to participate in the social security system if the new social security amendments are passed. the retirement age for men will be lowered from 65 years to 62 yearsthe same as for women. and those who opted for early retirement will receive full benefits instead of reduced benefits. moreover. it will be easier for those who would like to join the social security system after retirement from jobs  covered by social security to do so sooner and to receive larger benefits. but all of this depends on prompt action by the senate. more than half the senate has annced its support for the 20percent benefit increase. most senators. i am sure. are in favor of the other changes in the social security law. but the key element is actionand i hope the committee on finance is  prepared to get this important measure to the senate floor so that the senate can work its will and insure that older people will have a decent chance to get along in todays world of rising costs.
. last year congress approved the casesymington amendments which placed an absolute spending and personnel ceiling on american programs in cambodia. this year the foreign relations committee has again approved a spending limit on u.s. assistance. to cambodia. the personnel ceilingremains a part of the law. the administartion has requested $348 million in funds for cambodia in fiscal 1973. but the foreign relations committee cut this figure to $275 million. while the senate is considering whether or  to increase fiscal year 1973 request. it should keep in mind that executive failed to spend an estimated $92 million of the funds voted in fiscal year 1972 when the congress voted the full administration request of $341 million. the washington star correspondent in asia. henry s. bradsher. recently publishedlan account of some of the difficulties the united states has in spending money in cambodia. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
i wish to inquire of the senator from washington as to the pre.cise disposition of the funds allotted under title v esea. there has been some discussion as to the specific appropriation of funds added on the house floor which were  included in the house committee repoit. what is ..the senators understanding of the house action and what is the intention of the committee with regard to amounts added above the budget request for title v. -. mr. magnuson.- the senator is correct that there* has been some question about the figures on title v. it is my understanding  that the house action really intended that an additional $10 million was to be added to the budget figure for part a of title v esea. making the house action on title v total $43 million in part a. title v. and $10 million in part c. title v esea. for a total of $53 million.
it is my understanding this action was intended to compensate state education agencies for the loss of funds formerly available on a flat grant basis under section 402 of the general education provisions act. because of the matching requirements and population formula of part c of title v esea. 32 state education agencies would have received less money in fiscal year 1973 under the presidents budget.
i am saying this: all flat rate taxes are bad. and that taxes in which there is provision for apportioning the benefits that the municipality is giving residents opposed to residents is bad also. i think they are unfair and we should  be a party to that taxing transaction. we should  add the weight of the federal government to the perpetuation of this collection of taxes.
what i am saying is  to justify property taxes. as such. the courts have begun to take a look at the matter of taxes and i am sure we are in the process of correcting the situation. but i see reason why. contrary to the trend which is in the right direction. the federal government should insist on tax collecting.
there may be an apparent short range advantage in collecting this tax for the cities. but in the long range it is  an advantage. it tends to drive out employment and businesses. and make the cities even less of a going concern than they are . i think it is a bad tax.
to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate disagrees to the amendments of the house to the bill entitled "an act to amend the international ecoic policy act of 1972." requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. sparkman. mr. proxmire. mr. williams. mr. stevenson. mr. tower. mr. bennett. and mr. packwood to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that mr. fulbright and mr. stevens were appointed as conferees on the joint resolution (h.j. res. 636) entitled "joint resolution making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1974. and for other purposes." in lieu of mr. magnuson and mr. cotton.
. i would like to join as a cosponsor of the amendment. the amendment simply restores the amount that the budget originally asked for. the house eliminated it. it was  appealed. in connection with the program.  only the people of new york but the people of new jersey are benefited and lives are involved as well as property. it is a matter of lasting interest. i hope we may be able to give it fay-. orable consideration.
. last year at this time. senator humphrey ably impressed upon us the grave damage that malnutrition can cause to infants and young children. it was clear to us at that time that irreparable physical and mental damage due to malnutrition can best be avoided through the provision of highly nutritious foods to children during the early stages of their lives. we set out to solve this problem by creating the special supplemental food program for women. infants. and children. we authorized the wic program for a 2year periodfiscal year 1973 and 1974 and required a total expenditure of $40 million during that period. i strongly support this legislation. therefore. because it reemphasizes our commitment of rescuing hundreds and thousands of infants from hunger and malnutrition. this new legislation authorizes wic operations for fiscal year 1975 and requires expenditures of $40 million in that year. i believe that this bodys total commitment of $80 million to the wic program will do much to pave the groundwork for a permanent program providing necessary foods to this most vulnerable of our population. last year at this time. this legislative body took aher step toward eradicating the threat of malnutrition amongst the impoverished children of this land through its passage of the wic legislation. we  reaffirm this commitment to these infants by authorizing the continued implementation and operation of wic for fiscal year 19.74 and 1975. for fiscal year 1974. the sum of $20 million is and was specifically mandated for the wic program. but this sum. of course. is in addition to any funds remaining unspent out of the $20 million mandated for use in fiscal year 1973. for fiscal year 1975. the sum of $40 million is  required. wic. therefore. has become a 3year program from which hundreds and thousands of infants can receive proper nutrition and thereby avoid the ravages of hunger and malnutrition. i believe this $80 million expenditure is the best possible investment we can make to insure the future health of this nations citizenry.
. if these amendments are adopted we will assure the continuation of the lunch program and. more than that. we will effectively place an essential and effective price ceiling on the lunch program. so that children will  have to pay more for their lunches. i urge adoption of these amendments.
. the senator from ohio has correctly stated our understanding about this matter. i am pleased to see that senator taft has included in his amendment language identical to an amendment i offered on october 16. 1972. on a bill to amend section 3306 of the internal revenue code of 1954. without my amendment. the bill at that time would have allowed the federal government to collect the philadelphia wage tax from federal employees who live in new jersey. i said at that time: while residents of new jersey do  object to paying taxe. to out of state municipalities in proportion to the services provided to them. they deeply resent double taxation. both where they work and where they reside. when they have voice whatever in the utilization of the taxes paid by them. and receive benefit from the municipality of their workplace. the amendment that i offered. then. requiredas does senator tafts amendment todaythat "the agreement may  permit withholding of a city tax from the pay of an employee who is  a resident of the state in which that city is located unless he consents to such withholding." i am pleased to support senator tafts effort today because it contains this important consent clause.
. earlier this month. the senate passed senate concurrent resolution 93. authorizing the joint ecoic committee to conduct an emergency study of the ecoy and to recommend legislative remedies to the congress. tuesday. we passed senate resolution 363 calling for a domestic summit conference on the ecoy. although each of these resolutions has merit. i believe there is one more highly constructive and necessary step the senate must take in this area. i believe we must pass senate concurrent resolution 88. introduced by senators nelsen. hart. humphrey. and javits. establishing a 20- to 30member joint ecoic committee advisory on the ecoy. when i annced my cosponsorship of senate concurrent resolution 88 on june 24. i said: i think we need to give the joint ecoic committee the resources to study this situation. to look at this new set of circumstances. and perhaps to devise new approaches to the perplexing problems that are upon us. the nations ecoic planners last year were unprepared for the effect of foreign demand on domestic prices. the oil embargo and subsequent dramatic rise in fuel prices placed a tremendous strain on the ecoy. shortages have cropped up in basic materials. bottlenecks have hamstrung areas of industrial output. the prime rate is up. housing construction is down. and our dollar is losing purchasing power every month. the total rate of inflation is the sum of many partsyears of accumulated pressure for a "growth" ecoy rather than a stable ecoy. increasing worldwide affluence accompanied by rising worldwide demand. competition for dwindling supplie. a pricehike wagehike spiral. these are new problems. and simply calling for continued tight money or a balanced budget or reduced federal spending does  address any of them. and both of the resolutions we have already passed simply urge existing institutions to do their jobs. this is  egh. we must be prepared to reach for new ideas. to call on new sources of information. possibly to reappraise much of our old thinking about the causes of and cures for inflation. i urge the senate to pass senate concurrent resolution 88. to give the joint ecoic committeeand the congressthe additional expertise to act affirmatively to slow down inflation and restore a stable ecoy.
. i would like to express my appreciation to the senator from mississippi and to the senator from nevada. the senator from oregon. and also the ranking republican member. we have worked this matter out. i think. in a very satisfactory way. it is a pleasure to me to be associated with men who understand their jobs and are so diligent and conscientious in the performance of them. as well as compassionate in their understanding of problems of the great area of the country which the four states here in question represent. with complete assurance and in complete reliance upon the assurances of the senators who have spoken and under the leadership of the senator from mississippi. i rest entirely comfortable. i would like. unless the senator from west virginia wants to make a comment. to withdraw the amendment. that would be my purpose when he is finished.
. as i think we all understand. this initiative on the part of the chairman presented itself only this morning. the first we had heard about this proposed cut was this morning. i think it is a fine gesture and i do  expect to oppose it. but i would like to discuss it with the chairman a bit because there are some things in here that are quite troublesome. for instance. amtrak. it is my understanding that the house cut amtrak from $143 to $125 million before the whole budget was stricken on a point of order. i understand if amtrak is cut aher $4.3 million under the byrd amendment. it will end up around $130 million. which may  be egh to get through until the supplemental. it looks as though the amtrak deficit may go to $200 million this year. i wonder whether. because of the importance of amtrak. we might  except the amtrak appropriation from the byrd amendment. i k that to make any exception of this sort may begin a nibbling away process which will destroy the whole purpose that the senator from west virginia seeks to accomplish. i wish we might discuss that a little bit because the senator from alaska and i went through this bill very carefully. i think it is just a question of what we want to do here. if the figure to be cut was an overall figure and could be allocated between agencies by means of transfer authority or other power. that would be one thing. we would like to get the senators view as to where we are going to be on some of these very important projects and programs that perhaps ought  to be cut at all.
 i want to make this point. i agree with his comments on the amendment. although i think i shall vote for it on the balance of symbolic values and meaning. i do  think i should let rest his suggestion that the committee. in its work in bringing the bill to the floor. cut safety measures in any way improperly. i think we did the right thing. although in many cases these are figures which are less than the budget requests. i think in all cases relating to safety measures they are higher than the house figure. and represent all the restoration requested by the administrative agencies. as to whether the additional cuts to be made as a result of the byrd amendment will cut into the bone and muscle of these programs. that is aher question and one properly raised.
. in our current energy situation. it would be criminal. in my view. if the senate kingly permitted any delay in development of an alternative that promises to solve many of our energy problems. yet that is exactly what we have been asked to do. nuclear fusion is an environmentally clean source of energy that relies on lowcost. readily available. and inexhaustible fuels. it does  produce byproducts that can be used for nuclear weapons and does  create waste disposal problems that are inherent in nuclear fission plants. the past 3 years have been the most productive in the history of controlled thermonuclear research and this research has reached a point where responsible experts  predict ultimate success with considerable confidence. these experts estimate that the united states can have a fusion electric demonstration plant in operation perhaps as early as 1995. their predictions are based on the assumption that there will be delays caused by insufficient funding of the fusion program. unfortunately. the budget submitted by the administration for fiscal year 1976 would cause just such a delay. of course i understand the need for fiscal restraint in our current ecoic situation. but i believe the administrations request is penny wise and pound foolish and unacceptable in light of our energy problems. in its budget for the energy research and development administration. the office of management and budget asked for $120 million for operations. $16 million for equipment. and $8.2 million for construction to carry out the fusion research program during fiscal year 1976. the division of controlled thermonuclear research had originally asked the office of management and budget for $150 million for operations. $27 million for equipment. and $32.9 million for construction. i have long had a special interest in development of fusion and other energy alternatives. this interest was heightened by the fact that the most important feature of the fusion budget request is a new. very large fusion facility called the tokamak fusion test reactor. which is to be built at the princeton plasma physics laboratory in princeton. n.j. as a member of the joint committee on atomic energy. i had an opportunity to look into this matter. i learned that  all of the money originally requested by the division of controlled thermonuclear research was needed to carry out the fusion research program without delay. the amounts requested in the budget for fiscal 1976. on the other hand. would  only cause severe delays but would add to the total cost of the program in the long run. for the tokamak fusion test reactor. for example. the budget asked for $7.5 million to be spent for the first year of the project. which was eventually estimated to cost a total of $215 million. in conversations i had with officials of the princeton laboratory. i was told that a total of $25 million could be used in the first year of the program and that this amount would permit an earlier start on actual construction of the project. later the figure was refined to $23 million as the amount that would cause ultimate delay in the project. when i questioned officials of the energy research and development administration at hearings held by the joint committee. they conceded that limiting the project to $7.5 million during fiscal 1976 would result in a delay of 1 year in completion of the project. in addition. they conceded that there could be a 10 percent escalation in the eventual cost of the project if $7.5 million. instead of $23 million. were provided in the first year. in other words. the project eventually could cost $237 million. instead of $215 million. in my view there should be question that we will make the needed commitment to this program. we should provide $23 million for the first year of this program and authorize the expenditure of $215 million for the full 5year program. because the work on the tokamak fusion test reactor will be done at the princeton plasma physics laboratory in my state of new jersey. it may appear that my interest in this project is parochial. my interest is more than parochial. it is in the interest of the whole nation to encourage development of alternative sources of energy. it is on that basis that i support other elements of the fusion program. for example. i believe more has to be done in the area of fusion material research. the fusion program plan of february 1974. described two neutron source facilities needed for production of high fluxes of fusion neutrons for materials research. neither of these facilities are included in the fiscal 1976 budget. one of these neutron source facilities would be built at the lawrence livermore laboratory in california. it would take about 2 years to build and would cost $5 million. a second neutron source. which would use a different techogy and provide a higher flux. would take about 3 years to build and cost about $22.1 million. it would be built at the los alamos scientific laboratory. in addition. i believe the operating budget of the fusion program should be increased by $20 million. of this amount. $5 million is needed to support the accelerated beginning of the tokamak fusion test device and $15 million is needed for supplemental work on confinement systems and plasma theory. and to accelerate neutral beam development. super conducting magnet techogy. and systems studies. in support of the budget additions i have mentioned. i believe an additional $4 million is needed to augment the $16 million budget request for research equipment. it is my hope that the development of fusion energy will  be delayed because a relatively small amount of funds were  available to pursue all facets of this program.
. today i am introducing an amendment to the internal revenue code to exempt state lotteries from the federal wagering tax. my amendment is cosponsored by senators beall. biden. brooke. griffin. hart of michigan. hathaway. mathias.
s budget. for example. requests $120 million for operating expenses for the program. the house added $20 million to bring the figure to $140 million. the $20 million added by the house is needed to keep the fusion program on schedule. of this amount. $3 million is needed to support an accelerated beginning of the tokamak fusion test device. the adational funds also would provide for expanded conceptual plant design studies for the experimental power reactoreprprogram. which will be the next development in the program after the tokamak fusion test reactor. the $20 million also would allow full support of neutral beam development on a time scale consistent with the tftr schedule. in addition. funding would be provided for reactor materials studies and superconducting magnet development. consistent with a 1985 operational date for the experimental power reactor. additional work also would be permitted on methods of heating and confining hightemperature plasmas needed for fusion reactions. the budget requests $16 million for research apparatus and experimental equipment. the house provided $18.5 million in this area. i believe a total of $20 million is needed to support the increased activities i have mentioned in connection with the operational expenses portion of the budget. before the fusion program proceeds to operation of the experimental power reactor. information will be needed on which experimental materials can best withstand high level neutron radiation. this work is scheduled to be done at an intense neutron source facility at the los alamos scientific laboratory. the intense neutron source. estimated to $22.1 million. will take 3 years to build. the revised budget did  request funding for this purpose in fiscal 1976. the house provided $2 million. it would take $3.1 million to keep this aspect of the program on schedule and i believe this level of funding should be provided. the additions i am proposing would add $11.6 million to the house action on the public works appropriations bill. it is my hope that development of fusion energy will  be delayed because a relatively small amount of funds were  available to pursue all facets of this program. i ask unanimous consent that the izvestia article referred to be printed in the record.
i think that the senator from maine will have to recognize that in order to accomplish this budget tightening operation. that is to say. insuring that the appropriations committee has a veto oron the appropriation of any of this money so made available here. that we do have to raise the budget ceiling by the amount we are putting in here. and that that is  a breach of the ceiling. it is a recognition that we are bringing within the budget process expenditures which. really. as far as availability went were . and. therefore. he should  feel that this is breaching the ceiling in any sense. the ceiling should be raised automatically by this action to the extent of these reflows.
. so i welcome this initiative on the part of the senator from virginia. as he ks. i would extend the principle into many other fields. as well. and considerably circumscribe the freedom which the executive. regardless of party. has exercised in treating as executive agreements many kinds of agreements with foreign countries. which i think under the constitutions both letter and spirit should be handled as treaties. while i do  oppose an authorization for debt settlements when they are approved by act or by concurrent resolution as this amendment would provide. i think we still have to deal with a difficult problem of restoring the authority of the senate in regard to treaties. and i k that i will find the senator from virginia active in that effort. as he has been in the past. unless there is someone else who wishes to talk about this. i am quite prepared to have the matter go to a voice vote.
i take it. also. that the amendment would  be intended to permit the indefinite postponement of loan repayments or interest payments. too. while congress considered any proposal for a debt settlement. in other words. the debt would continue to exist and continue to run until congress actually deals with the matter.
i think this is a very happy followup from the points raised by the senator from maine. i fully agree and support the action that the chairman of the subcommittee proposes. i am sure it will be unanimously accepted. i would like. perhaps for the record. and in any event for the selfedification of the senator from new jersey. to k the senators view as to what bearing this will have on. say. other years estimates for the purpose of the budget procedure. will refiows that are intended to be authorized for appropriation be included in our estimates given yearly and later to the budget committee.
 can provide aid openly if he wishes to have congress publicly debate and vote upon specific proposals. the foreign relations committee last thursday also approved my amendment to provide funds for the interim quarter as the government switched to a system of beginning the fiscal year on october 1 instead of july 1. the amendment was approved by the secretary of state and is similar to those added to other bills. it insures that the aid program we consider important in enabling israel and egypt. confident of their own security. to continue on the path toward peace. will  be subject to inefficient and costly interruptions. overall. the bill represents an important effort to increase oversight of weapons sales and reduce the chances of conflict in the world. the amendments and the dollar amounts have been carefully worked out in a finely balanced package as part of the shared responsibility of congress and the executive. it is important that the bill be approved without further delay.
. i would just like to point out that in this bill we have taken care of the authorization for the fiscal year ending in june of this year. 1976. and also provided for the interim quarter. the period of transition between that time. the 1st of july. and the beginning of the next fiscal year under our new dispensation which will be october 1. what we have done is to take. just in very simple terms. onequarter of the amounts involved in the bill and included them as authorized for that interim period. we did this with the feeling that there ought  to be any sudden shift. that the way things were running was understood. and that if there are to be changes in these programs they ought to be more carefully considered and at greater depth than we would have had a chance to do with them in the time we had at our disposal. because it has been essential that we take action quickly on this bill so that our budget processes may be carried forward under the new law. i want to express my satisfaction with the fact that when the chairman of our committee raised this question with the people downtown he got explicit assurance that this was a satisfactory procedure. namely. of taking onequarter of the amounts in the bill and authorizing them for the 3month period between
. i believe that the house action monday to remove the ceiling on highway safety grants was likewise unwise. this subcommittee recognizes the great value of this federal/state program and has carefully reviewed its accomplishments over the last several years. as a result in fiscal year 1976 we recommended an increase of $12 million over the budget request and the house marks. we prevailed in conference. due in large part to the effort of our chairman and testimony received in fiscal year 1977 hearings indicates that the additional $12 million has been well spent. in h.r. 14234 we are recommending a ceiling of $150 million-$30 million over the budget and house. this once again demonstrating our confidence in this program. the removal of the ceiling would essentially nullify our oversight role and seriously hamper the orderly growth of this program. it is our joint responsibility to assure that tax dollars are being spent in a manner that provides the greatest return. i believe that the procedures recommended in our bill are the way to do that. therefore. i would hope that the house would recede in conference.
mx.  i think you do this once in a while. there are a few other people that k about this. i mean it is  a secret any more. that this can be done. so when we say generation skipping. that is what we cll this. we are setting up arrangements that avoid taxes for several generations. we can say that sort of thing is  significant to consider and to face up to in the estate and gift tax area. it seems to me that until you face up to this you havent got an estate and gift tax that really is a very significant factor. . i will let one of my colleagues carry on from here. they cant talk as loud. and they -cant use a blackboard but -they can go on. mr. lewis you filled it up. the cnimirsaai. very -excellent. professor casner.
. i ask unanimous consent to place into the record an excerpt from senate report 9599 on the supltlemental state department authorization for fiscal year 1977. the committee staff study. and an excerpt from a 1976 memo by former state department legal advisor monroe leigh.
. i would like to associate myself with the remarks of the senator from indiana and the senator from oregon. for too long we have awaited a 200mile fishing zone and  that one has been established. we need to insure that it is well managed. in that regard. the additional 50 positions and the restoration of $5 million to the 200mile budget are well deserved.
. the dispute over whether to put the b1 bomber into production involves almost as many factors as the complicated design of the plane itself. the senate. by a 5738 vote on february 1. again voted against funds for building a 5th and 6th plane for research and development. the two additional planes were sought by those who want to keep work on the b1 continuing as long as possible in the hope that the carter administration may reverse its position against putting the plane into production. the decision last year against production was a tough one and surprised most observers in view of the usual history of such matters. however.- the b1 is something special.  only in design but also in its price tag. the estimates that production models of the plane would cost about $135 million per copy made it questionable whether the aircraft was worth the money. our budget is  unlimited and there must be every attempt to make the best use of our funds. there is an even more pressing need for tactical aircraft. such as the f15. to improve our ability to counter the soviet unions massive armor force. and to modernize our navy. i supported funds for these purposes. as well as alternative approaches to meeting our strategic requirements such as modernizing and adapting the b52s to carry cruise missiles and developing a long range. strategic version of a newer bomber already in service. the fb111. it is necessary to maintain our defenses. it also is possible to do so without automatically approving every weapons system the designers want to come up with and the pilots want to fly. careful evaluation is needed and i did support earlier funding proposals for research and development of the b1. i concluded. however. that four planes for this purpose were sufficient. keeping open the b1 production route aher 6 to 10 months did  appear to be worth the estimated threefourths of a billion dollars for building and testing two more bis.
the senator and i are on the same wave length. absolutely. i just want to make this point: the 5 percent is really more than accounting for the rise due to inflation. in the second place. it is  appropriate to recommend that it be authorized. it is practically identical with the budget request. it is extremely modest. the only increase over the budget of any substance relates to population control. some $20 million. the rest is just about identical to the budget request. i do hope that for the sake of a symbol we will  send out the wrong signal
i thank my colleague. . i want to join with our chairman. senator magnuson. in urging the senate to approve the pending fiscal 1978 urgent black lung supplemental appropriation bill (h.j. res. 945). this bill provides $181.7 million for mandatory payments to the black lung disability trust fund. in addition. the house has agreed to a senate recommendation to include $43.5 million for mandatory payments to the regional rail transportation protective account under the railroad retirement board. the senate bill also provided $50 million to assist in implementing voluntary and courtordered desegregation plans beginning in september in a number of cities. the house bill did  contain funds for emergency school aid (esa). as it is kn. but the other body  has agreed to a $25 million supplemental level for this program. i also point out that $25 million already is available for this purpose in fiscal 1978 through the regular laborhew bill. this amount. together with the $25 million provided in this supplemental bill. will provide assistance to the school districts with the most pressing needs. further. our laborhew subcommittee has recommended $75 million for the esa program in the fiscal 1979 laborhew appropriations bill to help meet the needs of other cities that will begin implementing desegregation plans during the coming fiscal year. thus. while i would have preferred the higher figure in the senates version of the pending supplemental. i believe that sufficient funds will be available in fiscal years 1978 and 1979 for the desegregation assistance needs that we can see at this time. we will keep the matter under review to determine if additional assistance is needed. i urge the passage of this supplemental appropriation.
. in view of the most hopeful developments at camp david. i had seriously considered proposing an amendment to add a specific appropriation for the authorized $5 million. however. i recognize the desirability of keeping this bill within the budget ceiling and the fact that such regional programs are at an early stage of consideration. thus. with senator iyes concurrence that there is sufficient money and authority already available under the middle east special requirements fund. i am content to see the program started with uligated money from that fund. i am told that the funds are sufficient for the authorized $5 million if there are suitable projects. it is my hope that the agency for international development and the governments of the middle east can see their way clear to give a high priority to such projects. it would be a good way of turning the agreements. documents. and frameworks of diplomats into tangible benefits for the people of the nations which choose to participate.
mr. chairnian. although i am voting for the bill to continue certain war excise tax rates in effect. i want to call attention to the inequities which exist in connection with excise taxes and which must be studied and corrected. for example. fur coats selling for as little as $32.50 carry a 20percent tax. as pointed out by small retail furriers in my district. certainly a $32.50 fur coat is  a luxury. but oriental rugs selling for as much as $2.450 each carry excise tax whatever. i shall do my utmost to see that the whole field of excise taxes is reviewed. and that people in the middleincome level are treated fairly. we must recognize that even if we bring the budget down drastically. as is  proposed. it will still be huge. in view of the billions we need for veterans rehabilitation. essential government services to which we are committed. and an army and navy adequate to our position in todays troubled world. to pay these billions and yet to do our utmost to ease the strain of heavy income taxes on people in the middleincome levels. like those in my district. we must review all excise taxes promptly. we must be honest with ourselves and have a sense of responsibility to the nation. hence the necessity for passing this bill  to keep government income intact until the budget can be cut and the whole tax structure reviewed to make it fair to people of modest means. i shall do my utmost to bring about this result.
. we are entitled to an explanation from the head of the executive department on this point. the house passed the bill on a record vote after assurances by the chairman of the appropriations committee. in response to my questions. that opa could handle rent control effectively until the 30th of june. provided that opa administered its finances honestly. members on both sides of the aisle voted overwhelmingly for it. including the ranking miity member of the appropriations committee. who had stated opas position in the debate. i am convinced that practicably tenants can have adequate relief under the present law.  can landlords. unless rentcontrol administration continues. the bureau of labor statistics price index is at the highest point in its history. the high cost of living must  be added to by a rent boost .
. i intend to support this bill because i believe that people in the lower income and moderate income brackets.  2 years after the war. must have some tax relief from the high wartime tax structure to help them meet the high cost of livingup over 60 percent since 1939. i was against an acrosstheboard tax reduction because i considered it unfair to the ordinary citizenin my district and would be against it today if it were before us. the further reduction of the tax by onethirdfrom 20 to 30 percentfor the great bulk of the taxpayers in my district does make egh of a difference to them so that i must support the bill. i still do  like the feature of the bill giving a 20percent tax. cut to taxpayers up to $300.000. i believe that the cut should have been graduated. this 20 percent cut down materially and the saving in the amount available for tax reduction used to increase the tax cut to over 30 percent for those in the middle and lower income brackets. however. the need of my constituents for some tax relief to help them meet living costs is so great that i feel that as their representative i must vote for the bill with its imperfections rather than vote for tarx cut at all. the figures also show that this readjustment of taxes from war to peace will allow for a substantial debt reductionessential to the future of the country in times of high national income like today. i have surveyed the opinion of the rankandfile citizens of all parties in all parts of my district. and this is what they want me to do by an overwhelming majority.
we talk a good deal about prices coming down. we feel we are headed for a deep depression because of the bad adjustment as between prices and wages. how can we therefore consider anything which will materially increase the biggest single item of the budget of so many american families. rent constitutes 20 percent of the budget of the average family living in rented accommodations. how can we seriously stand here and talk about any acrosstheboard increase in the rents of the country. what we have been preaching is that cost of living prices must come down and this is the place to keep them down.
. my amendment gives the courts power to stay eviction in a case in which eviction is permitted under this act for acts that the tenant has hing to do with. that is. in the case where a landlord seeks the tenants premises because he has sold the building or becaue he wants to move into it himself or because he wants to remodel it. my amendment gives the tenant egh time to find new quarters in those circumstances and does  leave it to state laws alone. the figures show that an emous shift has taken place in the country from rental to ownership occupancy. the shift is from 41 percent owner occupied in 1940 to 51 percent owner occupied in 1946 of the aggregate number of rental units in the country and shows that this amendment is essential. as you are going to stop a galloping inflation by keeping a roof on rentals without an acrosstheboard increase. you should also take this additional precaution regarding repossession of premises in the event of sales or for personal occupancy of the landlord. and give the tenant added protection in those cases. i believe the courts of new- york will do their best in such cases. but it is a very useful safeguard to have it in the bill.
ial election. a review of the work of this congress and its record and an assessment of what is likely to face the 81st ieth congress should prove useful information to all interested citizens. i campaigned on a platform of international peace through cooperation within the united nations. and domestic prosperity and stability based on an ever rising standard of living for all of the people of the united states.
. repeal of the oleomargarine tax is a long overdue reform in the interests alike of agriculture and of city consumers. it is in the tradition of the american farmer that he does  fear competition. and i doubt that american farmers wish to throttle the competition of oleomargarine with butter. we certainly want to preserve our dairy industry. and if it needs help in the public interest as do other commodities which are in the parityprice program. i am sure we will be fully prepared to consider giving dairy farmers such help. city consumers should  be denied. however. by an artificial tax. the cheaper food which is oleomargarine. to refuse to color oleomargarine also seems like an artificial measure. more sensible than it would be to refuse to color cloth just because it can keep you warm uncolored. i propose to support the substitutes to this bill which will enable oleomargarine. both colored and uncolored. to circulate freely in interstate commerce without discriminatory taxes. certainly the regulations requiring identification of oleomargarine in one of these substitutes should be considered by the dairy producers as going a very long way to make this legislation agreeable to them.
. these frantic cries that we hear  are all based on the kledge that this prograin is successful today and promises to be even more successful tomorrow. reference has been made to a point which i had proposed to take up in general debate. that is. to the position of the countries in the organization for european ecoic cooperation with respect to their own status in 1952. it has been stated that they anticipated in their plans this year a continuing deficit in 1952a dollar deficit of $3.000.000.000. but they do  concede any such thing. in the first place. let us get even that amount in focus. it represents a reduction from a deficit which was $9.900.000.000 when we started out with the european recovery program. anyone who has surveyed either in figures. or in fact. the unparalleled destruction of all of europe which followed in the wake of the war will realize that in 4 years that is in itself an emous victory. even a $3.000.000.000 deficit is  such a great one when we consider the fact that the whole western european ecoy affected is over $100.000.000.000. it is  such a very great one so that even if it were accurate. the european nations through the opening of increased trade opportunities in the world can overcome it. in fact this $3.000.000.000 figure showed up in a preliminary survey. and the oeec sent the countries back their programs to refigure in order to bring balance in 1952. the very same preliminary report which indicated there might be this deficit in 1952 also showed that the european nations could increase their exports to latin america. for example. by a billion dollars. they could increase their exports to the united states by $600.000.000. the united states today is having a very small proportion of imports compared to its gross national incomeover double what it was prewar. so the problem is by means insoluble. but these gentlemen who argue this point would have us. as one of the weapons in their armament. believe that the problem is insoluble because they want to discourage us. we are in the way of succeeding. we have had emous success. and  is the time to follow through on that success with the generosity and dispatch which is so typical of us. by passing this bill for the authorization as it is presented to us just as happened in the other body.
aher question. is it  a fact that europe. having had approximately $11.000.000.000 deficit when we started this program. even if there has been waste. it has been cut down to $3.000.000.000 in 4 years. and erp has more than paid its way and has done a remarkable job.
 sends up his message on point 4and i think we are all aware of what that is. the idea of helping with the technical resources of america in the ecoy of the worldi propose to undertake on the floor. and i hope other members will participate in it. a rather complete discussion as to where we go after the european recovery plan. i think our people are beginning to think about that very seriously. one of the great reasons. i believe. for the fear of recession or even a depression is that the united states has  made clear the policy which will follow the erp. and that our people recognize that .we can be prosperous alone in a world which is broke. the forecasts from overseas do  indicate that by 1952 all of western europe. and. indeed. the great contiguous territory of the world which is interrelated with western europe. will be in any financial condition to carry on on a sound ecoic level. the united states sooner or later will have to come forward with its blueprint for the ecoic future of the free world. a world that still has private ecoy. our world position is such that in our own ecoic and social interest we will have to come forward with our blueprint as to whether or  we shall be prosperas to what we shall do for the future. ous is very largely psychological in view there were great hopes in the inter- of the fact that we still retain our pronational bank. there were great hopes ductive power. yet the masses of the peoin the monetary fund. but i think it ple of the country are afraid of a coming becomes very clear that they have oper- recession or depression. ated insofar as world ecoic recov- the chairman. the time of the ery is concerned. in an exceedingly lim- gentleman from new york has expired. ited way. and i think it becomes clear . tween one and three billion dollars a year that under the best conditions mr. javits which can be thought through by the mr. smith of ohio. i would like to various business organizations of the ask the gentleman how long he thinks united states.  over $2.000.000.000 a the united states is going to be able to year in private investment can be fore- carry this load. it is a question  seen to follow the period of 1952. with as to whether we are  bankrupt the magnitude of these figures in mind- already. and some of us are really conand in my opinion these figures are con- cerned about the matter. i am just servativewe consider the international wondering what the gentleman thinks bank which has so far made in the ag- about it. gregate in all of its existence $650.000.000 mr. javits. i may say to the genin loans. one wants it to be other tleman from ohio that what the united than a conservative agency in the actual states can do depends upon the proloans which it makes. but we had a ductive power of the united states. that right to expect that in its planning and we do  live in a static world. that its use in connection with world needs a national debt before the war of well would be on a more comprehensive basis under $90.000.000.000 was a sound nathan has been shown in the past or than ttonal debt when our total production is contemplated for the future. was only $90.000.000.000. while today
there is doubt that a good many people in the polltax states do feel strongly about this poll tax and have over a very long period of time. yet despite the fact that the house has acted four times. the poll tax still hangs on. it is time that in all of the seven states.  just in one state or in two states. the issue be squarely met. it is an issue within the purview of the federal government. because it is a matter affecting the qualifications of the federal electorate. the bill should be passed here and finally enacted by both houses of the congress at this time.
. i take this time in order to clarify afew facts because there are lots of way§ to kill a bill and this is one of them. this effort to reduce the amount authorized by the figure which the gentlemans amendment calls for. for this reason. even assuming that bare subsistence for the people of korea was desirable between  and the end of the fiscal year 1950. the report on page 18 states as follows: it is contemplated that approximately onethird of the sum sought for the balance of the fiscal year will be devoted strictly to recovery. that leaves twothirds for subsistence items. which means $40.000.000 of the $60.000.000. secondly. we have heard a great deal about power plants and fertilizer plants. and so forth. these are  concentrated in th korea and unavailable to the people of south korea. south korea is pasture. even in order to get more produce from the rice fields. in order to get the food to a country having 21.000.000 people. you have to have railroads. or have some facilities. they have to have cotton textiles for the people to make their clothes out of. they have to have creosote for farm buildings. they have to have cement and all of the things that go into even a civilized society. the figure which is fixed in this bill is  sacrosanct but it is a figure apportioned to needs. and  subsistence alone. which is  egh.
we are unable to surely ascertain that fact. except that. as i stated. the unusually large amount of the egyptian budget which is devoted to arms purchases and arming the egyptian forces indicates the fact that there is adequate potential. either directly or through the arab league. for egypt to arm others of the arab states in the near east.
. tlhe gentleman from michigan a little while ago brought up the question of what i think about the patriotism of american industry. i made the statement i did because i wanted to show that there was in the american private ecoy a great area of patriotism and that many companies are. i believe. ready to give up all profits on defense contracts after providing for their reserves. i would like to emphasize one further point: the productivity of american industry will determine whether or  we will defeat communism because. unless our private ecoy can produce 25 percent more in the next 5 years than it produced in the last 5 years since 1945. we are in grave danger of losing the grim struggle to defend freedom in which we are engaged. i am confident that the american private ecoyworkers and management alike--can do it. it is this kind of support evidenced on the floor of the house by members of such diverse opinions as the gentleman from michigan and myself which may indeed help american industry to accomplish this goal for our benefit and for the benefit of free peoples everywhere.
 "called off the dogs" and both parties got together and inflation attributable to vast additions to the money supply and public credit was dealt a body blow . the people will understand that saving somewhat on interest payments on national debt in such circumstances would be penny wise and pound foolish.
i just called attention to the fact that appropriations for this fiscal year were in round figures $2.500.000.000 for ecoic assistance. plus which there is $5.500.000.000 in the mutual defense assistance program. the total amount is something in the area of $8.000.000.000 for ecoic assistance and mutual defense assistance. and i most respectfully submit that we are getting our moneys worth.
i would just like to point out one other significant fact to the folks back home. i got this from the international bank this morning. india has never defaulted on any external debt. is it  fair to say that that is a mighty good debt record and a mighty good precursor for a loan.
. but that contribution should be held down at least to the same amount which was made by this congress last year. the district of columbia has one of the lowest incometax rates in the nation. the sales tax here is one of the most favorable in the country. we have millions of people coming here from all over the united states helping to pay the sales tax in the district of columbia. there is county. city. state. school district. or township tax here in the district. such as we have in minnesota. kansas. and practically every other state in the union.
. there are a number of fundamental inequities frozen into this tax bill. first. there is the pension provision which fails to give the same exemption from tax to pensioners from government service and industry as it does to recipients of social security. also pensioners. all these people have given the best part of their lives to the service of the rest of us. there certainly should be question among them as to the taxability of this modest return in their later years. there is also considerable doubt as to the propriety of the withholding tax on dividends. bond interest. and so forth. a great hardship is worked. particularly on millions of holders of small blocks of securities who will be put to all the trouble of tax accounting and obtaining refunds. this has  been a major source of tax loss. there are many much greater which are  being dealt with at all or certainly  such summary fashion. aher inequity frozen into this bill is the heavy amount taken in excise taxes on gasoline. cigarettes. beer. wine. and liquor. television sets. and many other items. of the total amount of $7.199.000.000 expected to be raised from this bill $1.252.000.000 is estimated to come from excise taxes whereas out of a total of over $6.000.000.000 contemplated to be raised under the tax law we passed in 1950 only $73.000.000 was for excise taxes. the rest coming primarily from corporations. i believe we have again heavily taxed especially the moderate income family suffering  from the grave increases in the cost of living while we have much too lightly taxed corporate earnings and excess profits. these. among others. are major inequities and show the hardship in  permitting amendments to this bill. taking the situation as a whole i believe the only justification for supporting this bill is the timeof the utmost gravity for our people brought on by the communist menace of slavery to us and to free peoples everywhereinvolving also the nationalsecurity interest of the united states and to enable us to do the job at home and abroad that this tragic situation forces upon us. that is my position on this bill.
will the gentleman tell us who live in the cities what is his alternative plan in dealing with the fact that the consumers price index on all items has broken to an alltime high. 185.4. that the consumers price index for food is 227.4. what is the gentlemans alternative plan to deal with that situation.
. i am fo this stopgap resolution anc against the amendment to it to kill rollbacks. i see incipient in this debate. and i think we must all recognize it. the idea that there may be an occasion for slackening the determination of america in respect of defense mobilization. it was very plain that we thought in september of 1950 that the defense production act ought to pass as part of the defense mobilization effort to face the grim challengethe lifeanddeath challengewhich the communists posed for us. but  because there is this talk about just the possibility of a cease fire in korea we already see the possibility of a slackening and an attitude of "maybe we do  need any more price controls." the russians would be winning the greatest victory they could ever win if without firing a shot but just confusing us with talk of a truce in korea they could get us to slacken up the pace of our defense mobilization. every member of this house should realize that this is a lifeanddeath challenge to the whole of american society. the security of our nation it has so often been emphasized is threatened from within by inflation as well as by the communist imperialist threat from without.  that we have been informed that we must have a hump in defense production. we have also got to have a hump in the protection of the civilian population which is making that production possible. this population is in grave peril of seeing its standard of living seriously depreciated by inflation even further. should we let price controls lapse. it will hit the hardest the moderateincome families and older people and widows and orphans who live on social security and other small incomes. .as well as government and similar workers with fixed incomes. the lives of working men and women will be disturbed by the threat and the strife which more inflation will engender. all we are asked to do is to extend the defense production act of 1950 to july 31. 1951. to give us a chance to extend the defense production act. as we must. and to try to strengthen it for an adequate period. it is the least we can do for the men and women of america who are going to make the defense of america possible.
 or the administration to take into consideration in setting ceiling prices all kinds ofand i quote from the bill. subsection (c) (1) of section 402-"speculative fluctuations. general increases or decreases in cost of production. distribution. and transportation. and general increases or decreases in profits earned by sellers of the material or by persons performing the service subsequent to june 24. 1950." if that kind of relaxation of strict price control. which was insisted on. deserves increases. then that kind of relaxation deserves also decreasesrollbacks. i point out that the house was very willing to go along with an excessprofits tax. placing the very same kind of limitation on profits that it is being asked to place here on runaway prices by allowing rollbacks. by voting down this amendment we are setting a precedent. we are setting a climate. we are committing ourselves to the fact that we co  intend to go along with this philosophy that if everything goes up. that is fine. we insist by voting "" that there shall be rollbacks. the price administration people may have been chargeable with delays and mistakes on price control but there is means for correcting them by rollbacks. if they have let prices go too high. if we pass this amendment. that is exactly what the vote on this amendment means.
. i have taken the floor to oppose this amendment because i think one very important point has to be made in this debate and at its very inception. and this amendment provides the opportunity in an excellent way. if we are going to have partisan debate on the subject of ecoic controls for the american people in this national emergency with an effort being made to put the democrats on the side of controls and the republicans against controls it is going to be a very sad day for the country and it is  true. for the consumer has less chance of getting adequate controls if it is made a partisan issue. to get adequate controls will take both republican and democrat votes. let me point out before we get into this business of partisanship in this debate which threatens from the beginning that the administration from september until january had the power to institute controls. yet instituted neither controls or even a price freeze until january 25. 1951. so there are rosettes on the administration. either. especially when prices went up something in the area of 50 to 60 percent of the total rise between june 15. 1950. and january 15. 1951. in the period between september and january when there was power but controls. there are rosettes on anybody in this situation. the people. in my view. are going to judge us as individual legislators and  by party affiliation. on what we do . by what we deliver in the way of effective ecoic stabilization under this bill. with his customary astuteness. the gentleman from michigan. the ranking miity member of the banking and currency committee. has pointed up the issue very clearly. he ks as well as i do. and perhaps better than i do. that the federal reserve board has all the powers he feels they ought to exercise. . and that they do  need this declaration in the bill to be enabled to exercise them. what he is trying to get the congress to do is to direct that they shall do the things they have the power to do. before. and i emphasize the word "before"-there are any pricewage stabilization controlsthat is exactly what this amendment calls for. it says "unless and until certain measures are taken by the federal reserve board there shall be direct controls. it is the fundamental issue here between two very different schools of ecoic thought. one school holds this whole inflation problem can be controlled by the exercise of "central bank" powers over credit. the other school feels there must be direct controls. if we were dealing with an imminent depression. or if we were dealing with widespread unemployment in the united states. or if we were dealing with a degree of underproduction. then it might be thought that indirect controls should be given their head and given an opportunity to work the situation out. but we are . we all agree that we are dealing with a great national emergency. we all agree that we are in a condition requiring defense which is tantamount to the perils of war. we all can understand the figure of $60.000.000.000 for armament in this present fiscal year as against the average expenditure in world war ii of some 80odd billion dollars in the highest expehfditure years. the gentleman from kansas asked why consumers prices are up. they are going up because you are taking from 25 to 30 percent of the american production and devoting it to essential yet sterile utilization for military defense. it does  feed. it does  clothe. it does  house. that is why prices are up. and prices are going to continue to go up unless there are controls. this idea that there should be direct controls is revolutionary. socialistic idea. it is at a time like this a position taken by leading conservative newspapers like the new york times and the new york herald tribune and. yes. it is a position taken by leading banking institutions also. they say that certainly there is lots of room for amendment in this bill. there is lots of room for architecting this bill and that direct controls should  be fastened on the ecoy beyond the point where they are needed to enable us to deal with inflation brought on by defense mobilization. we can wait for the federal reserve to catch up with the problem through indirect controls. rather we muct take the emergency measures of direct controls to give federal reserve types of indirect controls a chance to be effective as they come along. in the meantime this spiral of prices chased by wages. chased by prices. chased in turn by wages. is going on and the indirect controls are going to affect the ecoy. if we take that tack. on a very much higher level than. the prices in effect today. that is the very thing that can destroy the ecoy of the country and thr t is the very result of inflation we are trying to prevent. this amendment does  propose just a statement of intention in the bill. ..t can be dismissed that easily. i assume congress means what it says. if we pass this amendment. then the house says it does  want direct controls at all. it means it wants indirect controls tried first and direct controls taken off. that i think would be fatal to the situation we are in today. which is a defense mobilization the size of a war effort. i do  think anyone in this house should be fooled -by the korean ceasefire negotiations. it was the russians who annced they wanted a ceasefire in korea.  the th koreans.  the chinese. but the russians. they are playing all the cards. they have decided it is in their interests and one of the big factors in their decision is the fact they think we are going to quit our defense mobilization effort if there is peace in kurea. if we were to succumb to any such idea the soviets would win one of the greatest victories they could ever have hoped for in their fondest imagination. this bill says we mean business. i am  for diluting it with the pending amendment.
. there are a certain number of members of this house who are against direct controls and whether we adopt this amendment or  they are going to vote against the bill. a great many of those have been speaking. this particular amendment affects the rest of us. who i hope are in a majority in the house. who are going to support the controls bill and want it to be fair. hing has been said about the fact that there is other practical way of controlling the slaughterer than by the quota system. -there is licensing provision in the defense production act or under this bill except under this quota system. that is the only way to keep our hands on the slaughterer. therefore. it seems to me strange that the argument is made that if we do  keep our hands on him by defeating this amendment we are going to have less. rather than more blackmarketing operations. it seems to me that if we deprive ourselves of the ability to keep our hands on him that is the very way to get more rather than less of blackmarket meatthe very thing we want to avoid. the only real control over meat that is linked to price control is the control of the slaughterer. there is rationing of meat and it seems to me if we want to avoid rationingand i think many of us certainly want towe need to have this kind of control at the source rather than to take it off. to defeat this amendment is the way to get less control rather than more control. i think all of the arguments in support of this amendment. other than from those who are just against direct controls. head up to the fear that some unreasonable regulation will be made by the price administrator. i think it would be perfectly fair to insert an amendment to the bill writing into the last section of the act. section 716. a provision that the congress shall have residual control. to be exercised by concurrent resolution.  only over the. act and the sections of the act but also over the regulations. rules. and orders and amendments to them issued under the acts authority. so. if we feel that regulations may become arbitrary or discriminatory or block out new producersand i am against that. too. i think there must be quotas available for new producers and small producersthen we always have the residual power in the congress to correct that situation. if we are in favor of the fundamental principle of direct controls. we have a right to the protection that regulations shall  be arbitrary or capricious. otherwise. i can see this amendment to bar slaughterers quotas as hing else but a further effort to dilute the opportunity to really make price controls stick and make them strong. i think if we have this protection against arbitrary and unreasonable regulations. we protect ourselves fully against anything the administrator may do which would be unfair.
 in 1948. all are equally consumers. all equally want to be strongly against communism. because we can stabilize our domestic ecoy. all equally want a stable and uninflated dollar. all equally want reasonable security for savingsbank deposits and life insurance policies. all want a dollars worth for a dollar spent. the antirollback amendments being particularly directed against food price rollbacks high lights this situation because the rapid advances in food prices are primarily responsible for the inability to curb inflation and the cost of living. in the period from june 15 last year to june 15 this year food prices rose over 13 percent in the consumers price index while the general index for all items in the cost of living rose under 9 percent. in new york city alone meat prices increased 20 percent in that period against the 10percent increase for costofliving items generally. some members may be assuming that because the mail is relatively  large on this billthough my mail is largethe people are  interested. but the problem is one of following the ecoic complexities of the necessity for price and wage controls in peacetime with many. like those who oppose effective controls in this house. insistent that prices will be lower without them. the people may  be very articulate but they are watching the situation very carefully. so carefully that the newspapermen think it newsworthy to watch even the teller votes. my conviction is that members voting against effective controls are executing an underwriting against rising prices for costofliving items. for if the prices do rise in the face of a weak and inadequate control bill the people will hold them accountable.  can i see how anyone can rationally expect prices  to rise drastically without controls with an assured $23.000.000.000 to $25.000.000.000 of excess purchasing power which will compete for goods to be created by defense expenditures in the ensuing fiscal year even according to so conservative an expert as prof. sumner schlichter of harvard. city members on my side of the aisle must decide here and  on these artirollback amendments whether they are going to underwrite their constituents against material price increases in costofliving items. if prices go up. consumers will find it very difficult to follow explanations in political terms for what went on here.
i would like to quote from an editorial from the new york times of february 1. 1951. supporting the position i have taken. it is entitled "in the name of parity" and deserves to be read by every member. it sums up the situation in these words: the exclusion of any considerable number of commodities from priceceiling regulations is calculated to defeat the whole purpose of an overall freeze. but when such commodities include a .great many food staples then the omission becomes even more serious. stability of the cost of living index is the very heart of wageprice controls. a rise in that index  only is inflationary in its uwn right. but to the extent that wage stabilization is tied to the index it exerts pressure on both sides of the inflation potential.
s proposal. i think this is a very illuminating report and that it raises many questions which we must consider carefully before this legislation reaches the senate floor. in order to evaluate the conclusions of this memorandum in the light of the administrations position. i sent a copy of it to secretary of the treasury douglas dillon for comment. in reply. i received four memodandums from assistant secretary stanley s. surrey. these memorandums answer some of the ssues raised by the report but they do . i believe. answer them all. in examining carefully both my staff report and the memorandums. it appears to me that one of the most important aspects of the whole matter has  been considered adequately by the treasury. a tax on the unremitted dividends of foreign subsidiaries does  affect only those firms and individuals paying the taxit touches all of our position abroad. the department of treasury is quite reasonably concerned more with taxes than with foreign policy. but we as legislators must look at both aspects of the problem before a wise decision can be reached. i believe that private enterprise can be one of the most effective instruments of our foreign policy and i believe that it should be so used since it is the basis of the ecoic system of our country. the proposed tax would have direct effect on underdeveloped countries. yet if it succeeds in cutting back investment in europe. then the closely dependent investment in the underdeveloped countries may be curtailed as well. furthermore. as my staff report points out. the tax would  encourage american firms to make ecoic decisions concerning their investment capital. on the contrary. a firm entering a foreign country must compete within that country. and american firms can do that if they are taxed two or three times as heavily as other firms there. also. this tax may easily be considered an effective violation of our present tax treaties. and. even if foreign governments do  object. it may result in hardship for miity stockholders. both american and foreign. finally. a careful consideration of the effects of this tax should take into account the fact that four countriesgreat britain. france. germany. and canadawith tax rates almost as high as ours. account for more than half of our foreign investment. this indicates that most firms are  lured into other countries primarily by low tax rates. and it shows that the effect of this tax would be confined to that part of u.s. private oversea investment which has been slowest to develop until . all american firms and individuals should pay their fair share of the cost of running our government. if the treasury believes that we should provide them with the means for enforcing our present laws. then i think we should give most serious consideration to their request. if new laws are needed to prevent the use of tax haven countries by paper corporations whose purpose is to effect avoidance of domestic taxes in the united states. then we should pass those laws. but the fact that some firms have abused the present system is  in itself cause for changing the system. without giving due consideration to the adverse effects which may be caused by the changes contemplated. i ask unanimous consent that the report by my staff member. miss helen smits. of new yorka student intern from wellesly collegeand a summary of treasurys memorandums. be printed in the record.
iunderstand the committee on rules has agreed also to report out a resolution to create a special committee to investigate whether foundations for evading taxation are being organized. does  the gentleman feel that the committee on ways and means might handle that matter. and it might easily be included under this resolution for the purpose of inquiry. if it was found desirable. i think the resolution relates to investigating whether foundations such as charitable foundations have been organized to evade taxes. it is the resolution sponsored. i think. by the gentleman from georgia [mr. cox]. does  the gentleman feel that the committee on ways and means can do that as well. and that it ought to be in this resolution.
. a question of principle is involved in the amendment which is before us  to cut the allocation of ecoic aid to india and pakistan. a question of such tremendous import for our future and for our own people that it must be spoken to. that question is briefly this: shall the united states. as its master strategy in the world. come out as a nation which believes it can only resolve the conflict of freedom with the totalitarian communism of the soviet union through war. indeed. perhaps only through a preventive war after lining up many armed allies. or. does the united states delieve it can resolve this struggle by peaceful means by marshaling such overwhelming support for free institutions that they can be attacked with the remotest hope of success. we should  care about people necessarily saying nice things about us. we are  that childishbut what we should seek is the overwhelming will to fight for free institutions. we should seek so solid a foundation for representative republican governmentsincidentally. that is a phrase that i hope my colleagues will votesuch as we have in india. which is in grave danger of toppling unless supported with ecoic aidthat the politburo will k it is wasting its time there. we just  invested $190.000.000. in round figures. in india to help them with wheat.  we are trying to whittle down what is already a small program in the mutual security act and make it even smaller. let me tell you why -this program is small and why the analogy with the point 4 program is  apposite. the point 4 program is only for technical assistance. it is to send engineers and other technicians down there who can advise india on what to do with their natural resources and what they need to build. and so on. the indians say. and very properly so: "we have lots of engineers. we have excellent british engineers. we have excellent local engineers. we do  need too much of point 4 technical helpthough we welcome it and have learned much from it. especially in agriculture. what we need.-though. is assistance to build the dams. the irrigation works. the roads. and the transportation systems which if our people are ever to have a really higher standard of living these very technicians advise must. be built. and they can only get it in that fashion." the people of india are part of what is called the columbo plan. which calls for the investment of about $6.300.c0o.000 in that general area of the worldsouth and southeast asiain the next 6 years. external investments to constitute about $2.800.000.000. of which indias share is. say. nearly twothirds. so this program in the bill is but a small part so far as the real substantial raising of the standard of living of the people of india is concerned. it shows the importance that we in the united states should understand that if we are to win against communism we must win mens beliefs and convictions in areas where they do  begin to understand us when we talk about free elections and free speech and security rights. but only understand us today because their own standard of living is so low. that which goes into their stomach. that which affects their health. that they revere our ability to make and deliver goods. unless we come to a realization of that and help these peoples to improve their standards of living. we will but feed russian propaganda by confirmation that all we intend to do is to solve the struggle between freedom and communism by war. i ask that the amendment be voted down.
. i have called attention many times to the real dangers in this situation. i believe they are coming to a focus in the year 1952good relations and complete understanding between urban and city dwellers are vital to our country. a concrete floor under agricultural prices with proper adjustment for increases in productivity and for techogical changes has validity in terms of national ecoic stability in mal times. but a higher and preferential ceiling endangering the whole price structure and the fight against inflation in a time of national emergency
certainly. i think we are  going to have a stable ecoy by spiraling the cost of living still higher. i think we can have a stable ecoy on two bases: one if the plans which we make  to boost our production 50 percent really becomes effective with american labor and management cooperating. which i am confident they will. and second. if we undertake first a fair and effective price control. which we do  have today to hold prices in line until fundamental influences of greater savings in ecoies of government. which i agree with. and i k the gentleman has been a very ardent advocate of. and which must be made. and of increased taxation which we have had to put on due to the necessities which we face. and credit regulation which is a part of what is called an orthodox way of controlling inflation have their effect.
. ody has a right to speak in this debate any longer on a cumulative basis. i should like to take but a minute to share two thoughts with my colleagues. one is the relationship here. the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york . which i support. seeks to restore a budget estimate of $7.231.329. if you will look at page 38 of this committee report. you will find that we are spending something like $3.500.000.000 for the services upon which contact officers are to advise. these include compensation. pensions. readjustment benefits. hospitalization. and so forth. this seven and a quarter million dollars is the human element. which is involved here. you can give a man all the benefits in the world. but if he is frustrated. lost. and has to wander around to get them. and feel his soul seared in the process. he will  appreciate it. so the budget provision for contact officers is to make it convenient and comfortable and sensible for the veterans to get with a full heart almost $3.500.000.000 of benefits. i submit to you. it is just  right and it just does  add up. the least we ought to do is to provide for these contact officers. secondly. i think i am one of a group of those veterans in the house of representatives who are very careful about any measure which has dealt with bonuses or other efforts to just compensate the veteran because he was a veteran. therefore. i think it is up to us as veterans to fight the hardest for an amendment like this. which represents tangible and intrinsic value important to a mans soul as well as to his well being and that of his family. i hope very much the house will grant this very meritorious increase. the whole situation is well put in a telegram from the american legion. department of new york. in support of the amendment of our colleague . this telegram is signed by state commander james v. demarest. and i quote from it: the american legion. department of new york. vigorously protests drastic reduction in veterans administration contact service budget * * * if enacted would virtually wipe out that service and place tremendous additional burden on veterans organizations who are  physically equipped to assume it. the service which is to be reduced in new york state handles over 200.000 operations monthly with 262 employees. proposed reduction amounts to approximately 90 percent.
the people of israel do  get their pounds at 74 cents. they have zurich or geneva where they can buy them. they live and earn in pounds in israel and are undergoing great difficulty and austerity to try to carry their defense and immigration burdens even with a lot of help from abroad.
. the defense support idea is built upon shifting to a "sustaining type of operation with its substantially lower costs" as quickly as we can. if we destroy that. then we are destroying free europes ability to do the maintenance job which we expect them to do as soon as the peak of defense preparation is reached. let me go  to aher point. we are asking free europe to do a great deal. we are talking here in very broad. general terms without any recognition of the other fellows problems. europes standard of living today is something like onethird of our own. that is true of france and great britain. i invite your attention to the fact that by the obligations which it has undertaken at lisbon to arm. further. free europes standard of livingin great britain and in francewill be further reduced even if we give them all of the defense support. in great britain the already starkly austere standard of living has to go down 3 percent more even with defense support. if we deny them defense support it will go down one eighth. in france if we deny defense support the standard of living of the french people. already so dangerously impaired. will go down by aher 6 percent. what do we expect these people to do. do we expect them to be on the first line of danger against communist aggression from the east and yet to be further ground down. to have their standard of living further reduced when they can look across to the united states and see that we have appropriated over $60.000.000.000 for our own armament and have a standard of living twice and more better than theirs. yet we feel that we can afford them $1.000.000.000 for help to a sound defense ecoy and for the armament production which we are asking them to undertake. i do  think that we should entertain seriously amendments of this kind or we will be giving our european allies a rebuff which they very well can resent. remember that there are many people in free europe who are really giving the dangerous counsel that communist aggression is inevitable anyhow. that the americans are going to desert europe as they did after world war i. and that europe might as well make the best bargain it can. we are  entirely on peaches and cream in this situation either and i seriously urge my colleaguesand if they need any reminderof the grimness of the peril we face that they heed the ice general ridgway gave to them this morning in pointing out the number of aggressors still around armed and shooting. i urge my colleagues to keep their balanced judgment on this whole business of indiscriminate cutting.
as i understand it. the department had said at one time it would have uligated $400.000.000 and that turned out to be $669.000.000. $400000.000 is accounted for appropriately as i understand it by the necessity for obligating funds before the end of the fiscal year. leaving $269.000.000 which the committee cut $200.000.000. leaving the other $69.000.000 as latitude in the situation. that is the issue.
. i am very glad to follow the gentleman from massachusetts. the majority leader. and to take the corollary of what he said in speaking of the great vision of dr. eaton. for what dr. eaton has irrpressed me with as a person and as a legislator has been that he holds what he believes in sincerely. and he believes that when men live together and work together it does  engender hate and suspicion. but on the contrary it engenders love and the opportunity for a better life. i think that has been the fundamental source of dr. eatons strength and inspiration to all of us. he .has rendered wonderful service in the committee on foreign affairs. i think few of us can evaluate adequately the contribution he made toward the determination of our future in his support of the europeanrecovery program and similar legislation in the years from 1947 to 1948 when he was chairman of the committee on foreign affairs.  alone the american people. but the people of the whole free world owe him a very great debt of gratitude. dr. eaton has also expressed on this floor something that is very precious to me and i think to every member. and that is the faith that he has in his fellowmen. individually as well as collectively. it has been a real influence in my life and i feel it has been the same kind of influence in the life of every member. while dr. eaton carries the weight of years on his shoulders. yet he still impresses us as a man of great vitality whose influence is strong. vital. and good. who still has many years to come. as for ourselves and i k i speak for every one of us. we wish for him as he leaves us many many years of rest. happiness. and fruitful work. because he could  be happy without work. and a final word about dr. eaton. to show his youth. his many years of youth. is the fact that he makes his influence so felt among younger men and impresses them with his zeal. it is  easy to remain so many score years young. and out of the depth of love and affection which we all have for him. especially the newer members for whom he has done so much. as my colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania said so well. we wish for you dr. eaton. many years of long and happy life. we feel that you are just going on your way as you always have. that you are  finishing but again beginning.
the third category is the gentlemans category of a project which was almost at the point of signing. and there. as i understand it from the chairman of the subcommittee he says if that fits in with the allocation which has been authorized by the congress of 35.000 units for a preceding year. or for the current fiscal year. then it will be part of the program. do i understand that is correct.
 in the utmost good faith has carried out his basic pledge to the american people. recognizing that because of his peculiar talents. leadership. and experience. they trusted him with the security of this country in an hour of great peril. i believe that he will carry out that pledge to the american people to the full. that he will bring about cuts in expenditures and cuts in taxes within a balanced budget. but. beyond everything else. only as the security of the united states will permit. : ... . . i and . . why is western europe this year spending upon its military forces $14.930.000.000. whereas we -will spend by this bill for the same purpose if we appropriate the whole amount authorized. $2.079.698.870. does that sound like a giveaway to the people of europe. would they  be very much better off if. instead of accepting the giving away of this amount of money. to accept the proposed amendment of the gentleman from south carolina and the gentleman from alabama and to say: "sure. mr. united states. you protect us. with what. "with the hearts and the lives of your young men as well as with your treasure. but particularly the hearts and lives of your young men." these gentlemen seem to be very solicitous about a policy which in actuality will require western europe to jeopardize seven times as much in money as we do. plus the lives of its youth. if only we help give them the tools to do it with.
yes. you can buy morale. you can buy the will to resistbut the will to resist in this modern techogical world is worthless without weapons. we are supplying the weapons to be added to the morale and the will to resist. i would like to remind the gentleman in speaking about france and italy that it cost 10 million casualties. including almost a million american casualties. to redeem europe from the grip of hitler. do you want the same thing to redeem europe from the grip of the kremlin. we discuss this bill at a very critical moment in the history of the world. events are  standing still. events are marching forward at a tremendous rate. if we stand still we can suffer from the juggernaut. these events are taking place in germany through the tremendous effort of the soviet union to unify germany on its terms. which is dangerous to the free world and to the key participation of western germany to the defense of europe. the soviet union is also making efforts to pull apart the unity of the free world in austria by permitting increased traffic between the zones and other ameliorating measures. in turkey. through rencing claims to borderlands and to offer to negotiate anew on the dardanelles. in korea. through a truce. in great britain. by trade offersemous trade offers. in japan. by offers of a rumored two to two and a half billion dollars worth of trade from communist china. in czechoslovakia and in east germany. we see the stirrings of freedom in the spontaneous uprising of working people. . under these dynamic conditions. are we going to let the great free peoples of the world each go off on their own. or are we going to do something to help them in a reasonable way. and it is a reasonable way to maintain their community of interest in the defense of freedom and in its development. we are spending well over $40 billion for the armed services of the united states in fiscal 1954. we are spending a maximum of $5 billion on this foreignaid program. . great people. and the american people are a great people. world leaders want to plead selfpity or do any breast beating. the american people have a gross national product this year of about $360 billion. they have a national income of about $290 billion. in the face of that. can we say that $5 billion to help the rest of the free world to meet urgent problems. mainly of military defense. is too much. furthermore. it is to help us in defense against the greatest threat the free world. has ever kn. is that too much11/2 percent or less than 11/2 percent. that is  so in the eyes of the american people. the security of our country is being tremendously buttressed by this program. and this should be at the lowest possible cost. and when compared to our capability the cost is absolutely reasonable. i would like to produce evidence on that. the new secretary of the treasury is a very conservative gentleman. he has gotten a great reputation in the country for being very careful with money. let us see what he says about this program. you would think he would be pretty cautious about it. i asked him a question on page 306 of the record. i said: mr. secretary. do you believe that the total amount asked for in this program. $5.800.000.000--it is  down $800 million from thatis within the financial capability of the united states. as you are in charge of that financial capability." this is his answer. and i would like to read it in full.-
i would just like to conclude by reading the answer of secretary humphrey. the committee will recall i asked him whether $5.8 billion was within the financial capability of the united states: secretary humphrey. that is a most difficult question to answer because very frankly i think we ought to balance the budget and if we cut it all out we would come nearer balancing the budget. on the other hand. i do  think we can or should cut it all out. i hope that it will be somewhat further reduced. i hope there will be aher four or five hundred million dollars to come out of the authorization but i think that the expenditures that are contemplated. nearly all the ones that i have gone through. aind i have gone through most of them. are desirable expenditures to make. withstanding the fact that we do  see the balanced budget yet in sight. this is the financial man of the united states. and i think that ought to be a conclusive answer to those who say we are bleeding ourselves white.
 is absolutely right when he says we should  make this cut. i say. in deference to his views as a great leader whom we have elected expressly for this purpose. the first time he comes to us for aid in implementing the foreign policy of the country we should at least follow his minimum views on a tight budget with all of these restrictions that we have put in.
 only some weeks ago by over 10 percent. $650 million as against $7.300.000.000 roughly. which includes the uligated balances. as far as the motion to recommit is concerned. and i think it is very important. what does it do. it strikes at the very weakest point of the bill by seeking to take aher $211 million off of the uligated carryover for military assistance to europe because let us  forget that we have already put in blocked account and tied up a billion dollars of the military assistance for europe in the authorization bill if the european defense community is  approved in this fiscal year. observers in europe tell us that is  at all sure. we like to stand here and assume that we are the masters of all events. however. we are only the mere servants. if edc is  approved in fiscal 1954. it takes in effect a billion dollars of military assistance for europe out of the bill unless congress acts to lift the restriction. what my colleague who is going to offer the motion to recommit is doing is to take $200 million more out of that very same item of military equipment for europe. let me point out also that the europeans are spending this year $14.900.000.000 of their own money. and everybody agrees they have a lot less than we have even for so serious a matter as defense for military equipment and military use. hence i believe this conference report is the best that can be done in this situation and. that it fully sustains the prerogatives of the house. may i say one word about the debt limit. certainly the debt limit is very important to all of us. it is also important to see what the united states has gotwhat it has got to defend. what the united states has got to protect. what is back of the debt limit and behind the securities of the united states. figures recently released by the national industrial conference board say that assets and property of american consumers is valued at almost three quarters of a trillion dollars. net. personal incomes are at the rate of $285 billion per annum (upon estimated 50 percent in real buying power since 1939) and gross national product is at the rate of over $360 billion per annum. does anyone pretend that the united states is  solvent. even with the increase in the debt limit. therefore are we  under the solemn duty in the congress to defend what we have. i believe we are and i believe the house will feel the same way.
. as one member i must vigorously protest the sharp cut made in the appropriation for the united states information agency. over $13 million under the budget estimate. at a time when it is estimated that the communists are spending the equivalent of $1.500.000.000 in this very field and when we are locked in a mortal struggle with them in europe. asia. and the americas it seems inconceivable that we would  go all out in our own education and information program. all the arguments which have heretofore been made against this agency have  been answered. it has a directive from less than the national security council. it is magnificently staffed. it has trimmed its employees by onethird. its scripts and presentation are hard hitting. factual and direct.  that the agency has been reorganized and consolidated. answering all the complaints of before. we must back it in a full program. this is an essential third of the fight against communism. the other two parts being military and ecoic. to say that the amount granted is the same as last year is  an answer because last year the program was in reorganization and was still being held down as a changeover from the previous administration and in view of a major move from new york to washington and other factors. i recognize the situation before the house and shall do all i can to get this amount materially increased in the other body and in conference.
 eisenhower. general bradley. and other distinguished people without their approval or consent. and so the new york law requires that they must have written authority before they can use such names on solicitations or in aid of such fund raising. four billion dollars a year is raised by charitable contributions from the american people. and a great deal of the cost of it goes into mailings. this is an effort to separate the sheep from the goats. the great preponderance of the taxexempt organizations which the government favors in tax exemption are perfectly honest and do a good job with a very modest basis of overhead. but there are some which have violated the publics confidence. and they tend to discredit the others. so the people have tried to act against them in new york. and my effort here in pursuance of the legislation which i introduced to implement new yorks regulatory plan is to have the state law aided by federal law.
the gentleman states that if we accept this figure our government will be able to perform its obligations which are contractual. undertaken in connection with infrastructure. according to the representation of the budget bureau.
. i served with the gentleman from alabama on the foreign affairs committee. he is author of the battle act for the control of the eastwest trade. he has made magnificent contributions  only to the committee but to the policy of our whole nation and i think the nation owes him a debt of gratitude. i wish him godspeed and the best in the days ahead.
assuming that the administration would do that. at the present time i feel that we are hampering the administration in this amendment with more conditions than are justified. considering what it is trying to accomplish. and therefore probably so neutralizing the capabilities in the use of the $200 million as to make it useless for the purpose intended. i think there is a grave question for every senator who voted against the russell amendment to consider. as to whether we should  follow through on that vote with a provision that the $200 million shall really be available for free use. depending for our sanction as to the way it is used upon the fact that it is only $200 million. and that it will expire at the end of this fiscal year.
. on behalf of myself. and the senior senator from oregon . i introduce for appropriate reference a bill to repeal the present 1 percent sales tax imposed in the district of columbia on food purchased for home consumption. the bill would  affect the levy on restaurant meals. the receipts from the tax have been very disappointing. in that only about $2.225.000 a year has been collected from it. as contrasted with the very much higher estimate. the amount involved is a very mi proportion of the total budget of the district of columbia. of about $220 million. a tax on sales of food is  imposed in such large cities as new york. philadelphia. boston. los angeles. or san francisco. furthermore. it falls on those who are least able to pay it. and can least afford to do so. we believe the provision should be repealed.
. i present. for appropriate reference. and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. a resolution adopted by the petworth citizens association. inc.. of the city of washington. favoring the repeal of the sales tax on food bought in grocery stores in the district of columbia.
. this morning i contacted usia for a more uptodate estimate of how much russia is currently spending for her giant propaganda network. it was informed she spends somewhere between $500.000.000 and $1.000.000.000 each yearand that figure does  include the very considerable cost of isvestia and pravda. the communist newspapers. it does include funds for radio moscow. tv. propaganda movies. leaflets and similar activities. obviously. russia is  only willing to spend. but in fact already is spending some nearly 10 times the current budget for usia. in an all out effort to sell the communist ideology to the world. this does  mean that the budget of the united states information agency should  be scrutinized with the greatest care. like that of any other agency. but i think it does mean that the united states information agency should  be punished by deep budget cuts. let us test this out on the cuts already made by the other body. we find the following situation. to maintain the work of the agency at least at the level of the current fiscal year would require $116.600.000adding to last years appropriation $2 million to cover mandatory civil service requirements. and $1.100.000 as the first installment on the mideast radio transmitter. instead. the agency has been allowed $10.300.000 less. in addition to the restoration of this $10.300.000. $18.600.000 is needed for increased activity of vital importance to our country in the current phase of the cold war. let us  forget that the soviet union is about to launch a new campaign under the guise of coexistence. and yet at this very moment we seem to be moving toward cutting down instead of building up our counterattack. i think we ought to get very specific. i examined carefully the debate in the other body and the committee hearings. i have come up with some specific matters which i should like to put into the record. because that is the only way in which we can be realistic. i can be just as hardheaded as anybody who wants to cut the budget to the bone. of the $18.600.000 requested by the information agency to expand its activities. half is for stepped up information work in africa. in the near. middle and far east. and in latin america.
i believe the senator has made quite an interesting point. which has perhaps been somewhat confused in the press. does the senator from connecticut feel that the people of the country should consider the increase in the cost of living. on the basis of the bureau of labor statistics figures. or other figures. preceding january 1953 as vastly more alarming and a greater .threat to their permanent standard of living than the increases since january 1953. in other words. is it  a fact that in recent years there has been a small percentage of increasei believe it is under 4 percentalthough it is shown as a constantly rising figure. and in spite of the fact that it is constantly charged that the standard of living has gone up -tremendously. whereas the cost of living has geen going up only fractionally in recent years as compared with the drastic increases. on which the present increases are based. which took place before january 1953.
 and congressional leaders only through the usia. here is what he says: meanwhile. the understanding of the american viewpoint by the british and french people is growing. unfortunately. this is the time selected by some members of congress to cut down the services of the united states information agency. over the weekend it was annced from london that the work of the american agency inside britain would have to be curtailed for budget reasons. probably this will happen also with respect to france.
will the senator from massachusetts tell us the extent to which the bill conforms government budget practices to modern accounting practices. as i understand. the bill would accomplish that purpose. i think the senator has done an outstanding job in heading this effort. i compliment him on it. i have discussed the bill with the senator from maine . whose seat is next to mine. and i k that he would join me in commending the senator from massachusetts who was most generous in according credit to the senator from maine. i feel that this subject is extremely important. it should  be passed by without specific reference to how the bill will modernize government accounting practices. so that the executive agencies will  be charged. in every budget. with money which they are  going to spend.
i should like to point out to the senator from illis that i think he makes a very persuasive case for increasing the realestate tax in the district of columbia. however. it seems to me that the increased revenue thus obtained should be used for quite aher purpose. in other words. washington. d. c.. is one of the very few cities in the united states which has a 1percent levy on food purchased at grocery storesa levy which is regressive. and which bears very heavily on the persons of the lowest incomes225.000 a yearincidentally. almost exactly the amount the senator from oregon wishes to have added to the contribution the federal government makes to the budget of the district of columbia. in this connection. let me point out that the senator from oregon and i have joined in sponsoring a bill which wbuld repeal the present 1 percent sales tax imposed in the district of columbia on food purchased for consumption in -homes. let me say. in that connection. that a sales tax on food consumed in homes is basically a levy upon those who can least afford to pay taxes. and among the nations largest cities. such a taxis imposed only in chicago. detroit. and st. louis. in addition to washington. d. c. on the other hand. new york. philadelphia. boston. los angeles. san francisco. and baltimore. among other cities. have such tax. if the federal government does its part in increasing the contribution it makes to the budget of the district of columbiaand for that reason i intend to support the amendment of the senator from oregon. which. incidentally. would mean that in that event the federal government would pay only approximately 12 percent of the aggregate cost of maintaining the district of columbia. which certainly would  seem to be inequitablethen. in view of the present regressive sales tax on food consumed in homes in the district of columbiaa tax which is quite an unusual oneand in view of what the senator from illis has said regarding the deficiencies of the realestate tax imposed in the district of columbia. it seems to me that the senator from illis would have a much better case in favor of increasing the realestate tax in the district of columbia after the present tax on food consumed in homes in the district of columbia had been removed.
the article is headed. "turkey is going through a period of difficulties." the first sentence reads: the russian diplomats have in the last months been very active behind the scenes in turkey trying to convince turkish statesmen to accept a russian loan which will include technical and ecoic assistance. i think there are very few who will deny that one of the stoutest and most militant allies against communism we have in the world is turkey. so. in respect of turkey.  only has turkey been heavily dependent on our ecoic and military assistance in the foreign aid bills. but we are also facing great competition at a vital strongpoint of the free world. so far as giveaway is concerned in that respect. it is a question of whether it does or does  contribute to our national security. in terms of whether it is going to people who are already enjoying lush living. where we are giving them a lot of cream for their coffee. everybody ks hing could be further from the truth. as a practical matter. most of the people of the free worldmore than a billion people of themare living on a standard of living which is roughly oneeighteenth of our own. i repeat that figureroughly oneeighteenth of our own. they have about $100 a year in per capita income. as compared to about $1.800 a yeardollars of the 1947 vintagefor the people of the united states. fair. decent. and just person begrudges the wellbeing of the people of the united states. in my opinion. but at the same time it seems to me we must have some comprehension of the responsibilities of the man who earns 18 times more than the other fellow. and yet who lives on the same street. the question is. in very elementary terms. what condition do we want this street to assume. ours. or the standard allowed to the $100ayear man. that is essentially. in my opinion. an extremely important element in this question of giveaway. finally we have the question of reducing taxes. again. it is so easy to make sweeping generalizations. but we should consider a few figures. in order to reduce the personal exemption by $100 a year per person under our tax system. we need to have available $3 billion. $3 billion. what senator in good conscience would cut taxes $3 billion unless there was available at least $19 billion or $6 billion upon which to rely. here we are talking. in respect to this ecoic aid program. about possibly $600 million. add any figure to that which the opponents of the bill might want. anything they can develop from this bill certainly will  exceed a billion dollars. so i say again this argument does  hit the mark. and does  give us the true situation. so much for the giveaway point and the point on taxes. many of my colleagues have also commented on that subject. but i think it is very important to develop it so e of our people will misunderstand. because i believe we are facing this argument right . and have every right to meet it head on. the second big argument that is urged i have heard far 10 years. again. i respect it. or i would  be speaking to it today. it is the argument that the foreign assistance program does  win friends. that there is much antiamerican sentiment in the world. and that we are  necessarily liked merely because we give aid in various countries. in the first place. i think that is a rather naive standard for us to determine our policy mainly on whether we are liked or . i do  think we should be too much concerned about whether we are liked or  liked: everybody prefers to be liked. but that is hardly the standard for an international policy. i think what we are after is that the world should be such that we can live and develop in it and live out our destiny without running into world war ii. we certainly do  want to be hated. but i do  think our particular objective in life is to make ourselves so pleasing and so agreeable to everybody that all will like us. that would hardly demonstrate character on our part. or indicate character in terms of international conduct or international relations. i rather think that the standard of our policy must be that more nations will remain on the side of the free world than will go over into the satellite orbit of the soviet union. this has been for the last 10 years what we have been trying to do. and i think it is an eminently correct objective. the major area in the world where this argument is very important. indeed. one of the most critical areas. is india. i had the privilege of visiting in india with my wife last december. and actually going through the country to personally see what our foreign ecoicaid program is doing there. in terms of backing up the thesis that we are liked or  liked. or are doing or  doing something. or that the program does or does  contribute to indias capability for remaining in the free world orbit. . the proponents are learning. i believe that is illustrated by the change in the program this year. i feel. too. that we are becoming more. rather than less. convincedand i believe the gallup poll and any other opinion poll bears this outthat the foreign assistance program. within the reasonable compass which it occupies . is  bleeding us white and is  a giveaway. but is a fundamental and essential element in the security of the united states. and should be continued with honesty and dignity with that purpose in mind.
this action represents a doubt on our part. that is the way this amendment appears to me. many of those who are defending this budget have talked about "meatax cuts." i should like to k what the definition of a meatax cut is. if it is  an acrosstheboard reduction. regardless of where it comes from or what it affects.
as one who has fought for the presidents budget and has often found himself on the other side from the senator who is addressing the senate . the senator from arizona . i. too. should like to associate myself with his views. they are very vital and significant to the country. i compliment the senator from arizona for bringing the matter so clearly to the attention of the senate and the country. i shall lend every effort i can to bring these recommendations into being as an actuality.
i thank my friend from new jersey for his very gracious statement. he has been a strong right arm on this side of the aisle in our effort. anyone who has watched his performance in connection with what was the indispensable first step to see that this measure reached the floor instead of going to committee ks the debt of gratitude which all americans owe to the junior senator from new jersey. in which i gratefully and happily join. because i have admired him as a colleague both in the house and in the senate.
i do  want to tax the senator. and i am sure he does  want to tax me with something upon which he can put his fingers. i am sure we will both be on our feet on other occasions. and if the senator will check. i will say  i shall be glad to deal with the question whenever the senator wishes to have me do so.
. as the lowestranking member here. i think. except for the member sworn in today. i should like to pay my tribute to the indefatigable courage and determination of -my own leader. the miity leader on this side who brought this bill to the calendar and. to use a very ordinary phrase. which is very true in his case. bulled it through to this day. i should like to pay my tribute to the majority leader who. by the exercise of tactical brilliance. i think rarely seen in the history. of our country. brought together the necessary marshaling of forces actually to enact the bill into law. i think the country owes both of these men a debt of very deep gratitude. i have always had the conviction that civilrights legislation had to be bipartisan. the majority leader and miity leader have certainly proved it.
. on behalf of myself. and my colleague. the senior senator from new york . i submit amendments. intended to be proposed by us. jointly. to the bill to provide an exemption from the tax imposed on admissions for admissions to certain musical performances. i ask unimous consent to have printed in the record a memorandum pertaining to the amendments.
i do  k whether the senator was in the chamber when i engaged in the colloquy with my friend from new hampshire on the matter of confidence. it is my view that failure to increase the debt limit would be a blow to confidence on the part of those in the country who think we must act. therefore. favorable action on the bill would be one added reason for having confidence in the determination of the government to do what was needed. both in respect of defense and ecoics. which is the concrete basis for anything else we want to do. i would deeply appreciate the senators view on that question.
i thank the senator i deeply appreciate the senators comment. and i desire to state that i have had the figures checked in regard to what really counts with a businessman. i k the senator is a distinguished businessman himself. i refer to figures stating what we owe compared with what we have. it appears that in 1946 the relationship of our national debt to our gross national product. or our national income. or whatever one wishes to call it. was roughly 124 percent. as compared with a standard today of just half that. or roughly 66 percent. in short. we have twice as much availability of coverage for our debt today as we had in 1946. . i deeply appreciate the senators comments. and i should like to ask the senator to comment as to what those figures mean in terms of our capability to meet the exigencies . and our willingness to meet them.
. i shall take only a moment of the time of the senate. i have previously made the point that i think the defeat of the motion to recommit. and the enactment of the bill. are essential to confidence. i come from a great center of trade and commerce. it is my deep conviction that our ecoic downturn is the result of the hesitancy of confidence on the part of those who are largely responsible for management decisions in our country. that is pointed out by todays figures. which show that todays downturn is really an inventory phee. i believe that the proposed action represents an expression of confidence by th3 united states congress in our country. i believe the most important figures before us todayand the only reason for taking the time of the senate  is to place them in the recordare figures representing a comparison between the debt and what we had in terms of productive capacity. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point as part of my remarks a table entitled. "trends in gross public and private debt. 194656."
the figures show that from 1946 to 1956. the percentage which our federal debt bore to our gross national product was reduced by approximately 50 percentfrom 124 percent to 66.7 percent. incidentally. the figure i have mentioned is the lowest since the end of world war ii. i point out that in 1949. when we had. roughly. the same number of unemployed. a little more than 4 million. the percentage of national debt as compared to gross national product was exactly 100. whereas today it has been reduced by onethird. there is one further consideration which i think is important. and that is that the percentage which the overall debt of the entire countryfederal. state. local. and privatebears to the gross national product of thc country is very close to its postwar low. it stands at 188.9 percent. the only time it was lower was in 1951. when it was 182 percent. it seems to me that this move demonstrates the strong financial position of the united states. and the fact that the congress of the united states can today submit to a vote of confidence in the country. just as it is asking our citizens everywhere to vindicate our confidence in the ecoy.
was the 5cent rate made temporary. rather than an acrosstheboard 5cent rate. in order to minimize the action. in other words. are we really putting the burden on secondand thirdclass mall. but for the post office reation are we making the 5cent firstclass rate temporary for the obvious reason that we do . want to have it remain in effect any longer than we absolutely have to. and it is felt that 3 years is adequate. in other words. is this an effort to do something for the firstclass rate rather than an effort to tax it when we are  taxing the others.
i desire to join the senator in his expression of approval for what the committee has done. i wish to give a word of information as to my home town. which has so many performers who are very disquieted by the cuts which have been made in the budget for the fair. who are very loathe to go. although they k they would render a great service if they would go. this is a very important point. many such persons will be contributing their services. and they will be greatly reassured by what we have done. i express the faith and the hope that we will stand by our guns.. because i think this leverage amountand this relates to the question i should like to ask the senatorrepresents the difference between whether american participation will really be in firstclass american style or whether it will look like some kind of a pennypinching operation.
. on tuesday evening the great national organization. the fraternal order of eagles. held a reception at the hotel statler in washington for national officers and others who had worked in a great campaign. in which there had been gathered an estimated 800.000 signatures from members of the organization throughout the united states. in support of the effort of myself. the senator from oregon . my distinguished colleague [mr. ivesj. and other members of congress. to prevent the denial of opportunity of jobs to those over 40. the outpouring of signatures was fantastic. and i ask unanimous consent that there may be printed in the record a summary of the signatures. by states. totaling 671.246.
i shall be glad to ask for time. because the senator is touching on something that is very important. a tax cut seems to be an issue before the country. i agree with the fundamental principle expressed by the senator. i have been advocating the same thing. the theory of those who would cut taxes. in the very superficial. attractive way of reducing income taxes by increasing exemptions. is that it worked in 195354. however. every particular recession or depression is what we lawyers call sui generis. it has its own reasons and its own cure. we have analyzed the present recession as one caused by inventory liquidations and a contraction in expenditures for capital facilities by business and industry. a tax reduction would  result in more people buying commodities of various kinds. what a person needs is an assurance that he will have his job tomorrow. i also point out that the only one who will get a tax reduction is the man who has a job.  the man who is unemployed. so i am very glad to make comment on the statement of the senator from the great state of pennsylvania. i. too. come from a great industrial state. we would be fooling our people. and leading them up a garden path. if we led them to the belief that a tax reduction of $50 or $70 would cure the basic trouble. such a tax reduction would cost the treasury $5 billion. and once it were done. it would be done. regardless of its effect.
the senator from alabama is chairman of the select committee on small business. on which i have the ho to serve. it is very rare that we have an opportunity to pay such welldeserved tribute as that which we owe to our colleague. who administers the committee with great skill. and with less evidence of partisanship then i have seen for many years in the congress. this committee. for a committee without legislative jurisdiction. has a greater impact and real effect upon the progress of legislation than any other committee i k of. which indicates the degree of cooperation which animates its membership. i had the ho to preside at one of the tax hearings. by designation of the chairman. under the mal practice. the chairman would have designated one of the majority party. his action in that connection was illustrative of the nature of his work. i point out that in all the discussion on tax reduction. we are hearing altogether too little about tax reduction for small business. which needs it very urgently. tax reduction for a small business could do an emous amount of good. both in and out of recession. matter what the predictions may be for the future. i. for one. wish to express my gratification that the principal proposer of this measure. and chairman of ourcommittee. takes the time of the senate. upon an occasion when we are thinking about tax reduction in terms of an antirecession measure. to urge that small business be given full consideration and participation in any tax reduction we may make. in my judgment. a tax reduction for small business is indispensable. i hope the eloquent voice of our chairman and the support of the other members of the committee may have the desired effect in connection with whatever taxreduction measure may ultimately be written.
. briefly. the amendment seeks to provide the same privilege for dramatic performances as it is proposed to provide for musical performances where there is involved an organization which has civic or community membership. we have discussed the matter with the department of the treasury. and it has objection to it on the ground of any revenue loss. there is appreciable revenue loss involved. the chairman of the committee on finance. the senator from virginia . who ks something about the operation of the new york city center. has very graciously told me he did  expect that there would be any objection to it.
i voted as i did wisely. and i say that advisedly. i think everyone ks me as a liberal senator. and i believe i deserve that designation. i shall undoubtedly vote for the pending bill. and shall support it. when senators refer to the easter recess. we must understand that there is involved  an individual responsibility. but a collective responsibility. i would have been perfectly willing to devote a half day tomorrow. or to work tonight on the bill. but a collective responsibility is involved. when a substantial number of senators feel. as a substantial number evidently does feel. that they need more time to consider the bill. unless there is good reason to overrule them i do  think we have a right to stand in their way. the resolution for the recess was adopted previously. before the pending bill came before the senate. whatever juxtaposition of dates there may be. the resolution concerning the easter recess was adopted several days ago. prejudice can really be shown. i think the senator from illis put his finger on the nub of the situation. the house of representatives is  going to consider the public facility bill before the easter recess. whether the house receives the bill on wednesday the 16th of april or whether the house gets the bill on thursday of this week everybody in the country ks will make difference whatever. if we are going to talk about a comparison of recession measures. then i think the senator from new jersey is absolutely correct. the highest priority should be given to measures providing help for the unemployed. one can pretend anything else is entitled to a similarly high priority. for that reason. . with the greatest of deference to the acting majority leader. who is having his troubles today. for whom we all have the deepest affection and respect. i feel real prejudice can be shown. i think when a really substantial number of senators. in the exercise of their collective responsibility. feel that they want to defer consideration of the pending bill for a few days. or the number of days involved in this instance. it can be because of prejudice. i feel those senators should have that right to exercise their judgment. even though i may  need all the time myself.
. i submit herewith for appropriate reference petitions signed by many hundreds of my constituents urging repeal of the 20percent excise tax imposed on the retail sale of fur as one of the quickest and most effective means of stimulating the sale of consumer goods and halting the recession. reduction in the excise taxes imposed during the war years. and since continued from year to year. of which the levy on fur garments is one. must receive attention at the current session of the congress. due to the contemplated effort to renew such taxes at the end of the current fiscal year when they e::pire. due weight must be given as to the effect upon consumer buying of this and the many other excise taxes. such as those on automobiles. and transportation. which constitute a significant segment of the final sale price. i feel that these excise taxes should have at least equal consideration. i ask unanimous consent that only the text of the petitions be printed in the record. and that the petitions be appropriately referred.
. the senator from oregon mentioned the fact that i testified before the committee. hence my reason for rising. i did. i feel the  1 priority in this recession is legislation to deal with unemployment compensation for those whose eligibility has expired. this is essentially a recession of unemployment. the fear of losing ones job. and therefore  having purchasing power. has caused an inhibition of buying on the part of consumers and of an inhibition of expansion and buying of productive equipment on the part of manufacturers. it is very clear that it has been the diminution of inventories without replacement and the diminution of capital goods and replacement. as distinguished from the years 1955 and 1956 and the first three quarters of 1957. which have caused our difficulty. accordingly. i deem it my duty. in the interest of my state. which is the largest. in terms of commercial activity. in the united states. to vote upon this measure in terms of the highest priority. i believe the highest priority and the greatest expedition will be gained if the states are  required to have their state legislatures meet in order to make arrangements with the federal government. as is contemplated by the bill sent to the senate by the house. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record as a part of my remarks a schedule of the regular meeting time of state legislatures.
accused private industry of "standing on the side line to wait and see what the government was going to do instead of going out and vigorously driving itself." senator kennedy. democrat. of massachusetts. who said the administration has moved too slowly to counter the recession. said he has  favored a tax cut because of its possible inflationary pressures "in aher 6 or 7 months." nevertheless. he argued a reduction "might be quite likely" if an upturn is  apparent in the ecoic figures coming out "by the 10th or 15th o may." the massachusetts legislator said his owr view is that there will  be much of ar upturn in the second quarter. and predicted "its more likely" recovery may come in thc third quarter. these columns from the new yorr times of may 5. 1958. are illuminating:
i do feel the same way. i feel very deeply that the administration will stand foursquare with what it has recommended to congress. let me point out that the administration has actually negotiated with both yugoslavia and poland on these aid deals. i see indication whatsoever that the administration will recede from that position. which is in the national security interest of our country. that leads me to the next point. is it  a fact that when we say that the men in the kremlin can press the button and. as our british friends say. send up the red balloon any time they wish to do so. that they want to stay in their jobs and probably save their skins. as they wonder about poland and rumania and bulgaria and czechoslovakia. and see what we are contributing. they will have some doubts placed in their minds.
there are a great many federal employees in my state. i think at least as many as any other place except washington. d. c. i shall support the motion made by the distinguished senator from south carolina. which has been advocated by my colleagues. the senators from kansas and illis. based to a great extent upon personal experience. and for this reason: the test of what persons should be paid in times of recession are  what people get absolutely. but what they get as compared with productivity and the general rate of compensation as compared with the standard of living. applying that test to federal government employees. who. themselves. have machinery for bargaining for their wages. but must depend upon our conscience. our sense of justice. our analysis of the facts. the employees. by this measure. are being placed at least within shooting distance of parity as compared with what is going on in the rest of the country. i do  think it is quite fair to tax the people with whatever misapprehensions we may have by way of the cost of such wages. if there is a disproportion and a lack of parity in the salaries which they receive as compared with the pay of those doing the same kind of work in the communities. in short. i do  think the federal employees should be penalized because they work for the united states government. all the considerations which have been voiced. and they are important. should  be imposed on the workers because of our shortcomings in failing to measure up to our responsibilities as legislators or the shortcomings in the pay scale of the federal government which we have allowed to exist. for those reasons i shall vote as indicated by the distinguished senator from south carolina.
without intending any criticism whatever. i consider such a policy to be very shortsighted. i k of hing which contributes more greatly to an orientation of leadership in the world. in terms of the objectives of the united states in the free world. than the educational exchange program. i am very glad the senator has pinpointedas he always does so accuratelywhere our problem lies. i gather that it lies with the budget bureau. i shall do my utmost. as one senator. to bring the bureau of the budget around to a much more ample outlook on this subject. this kind of neglect embarrasses us very much in connection with many of the things we wish to do in the field of foreign policy.
i have served in the house. and i believe there is a misconception of the american peoples ideas about the state department and those who work for it. it may have been true in aher day. when most of the american people thought that jobs with the state department were lush jobs for socially wellplaced individuals. today they realize it is a question of survival. and a question of life or death. and perish the day when we have to require military expenditures instead of appropriations for activities of the state department in our effort to maintain peace in the world. i would also ask the senator from arkansas. who is a student of our foreign relations and stands high in the committee on foreign relations. to keep up his fight. i hope very much that more of our colleagues will join him. after all. it is the people who will ultimately decide. and they can do a great deal more with the other body than many of us can.
i believe that an entirely objective approach might defeat itself. i believe that what is most desirable is an objective and informed approach. for that reason. the commission. as we propose it. would consist of 6 members from the congress. 6 from private life. and 3 from the executive department. we feel. therefore. that that degree of balance would afford both practicality and objectivity. the congressional members would be serving in view of those from the executive department and those from private life. the other members of the commission would have the benefit of congressional experience. we can be abstract about codes of ethics. if they are to work. they must be related to the practicalities of our jobs and to the status of our relations with our constituents and with the executive departments. in the context of working. everyday life. otherwise. the approach might become so attenuated as to be impracticable. for that reason. we suggest this balanced kind of commission. i would. however. respect any contrary point of view. if we are to have a commission which is so objective as to be removed from the congress. there will be danger of producing aher report which would only gather dust on the shelves. the technique which is outlined in the bill is the very same one used for the socalled hoover commission on the reorganization of the executive departments. that commission was exactly the same kind of composite body. it seemed to possess objectivity and technical skill. and to command rather prompt congressional attention.
 of the board of commissioners. and in that capacity demonstrated a high order of dedication to the district. skilled leadership in his approach to various fiscal problems. especially budgetary. as they affect the district. and a deep understanding of the community as an urban district. which it is. withstanding the fact that here in the capital of the united states the people do  have a right to vote. mr. mclaughlin has tirelessly devoted his efforts toward developing a more workable method of regulating mass transportation throughout the entire metropolitan area. he is the motivating force behind the commissioners council on human relations to bring about improved race relations. he has adopted a realistic approach toward home rule in the district of columbia. i am delighted that this very able public servant. robert e. mclaughlin. whose ination has been confirmed for a second term as a member of the board of commissioners. will be permitted to serve the people of the district of columbia as a member of that board.
. i could  resume my seat without making clear the great debt the entire country owes to the distinguished junior senator from alabama in connection with the pending bill. which i believe must result in great progress in connection with the urbanrenewal program and other programs of great importance to those who live in the large cities and in other areas. such as are found in new york. we are deeply indebted both to him and to my dear friend. the senator from indiana [mr. capehartj who has cooperated in connection with what today appears to be so constructive a result.
. i introduce for appropriate reference a bill to grant a form of tax relief to the railroads which will encourage continuation of efficient passenger commuter service and enable many lines to deal with sizable losses incurred in such operations.
the bill would amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to assure that where states and municipalities grant tax relief to railroads operating such services at a loss. such assistance would directly benefit the railroads and  be absorbed by increased federal taxes. i believe that congress has an increased responsibility to provide this type of tax relief following final approval of the transportation act of 1958 in the senate today. it retains a house amendment similar to one i offered unsuccessfully in the senate. which authorizes the interstate commerce commission to consider public convenience and necessity. as well as the fact that a passengerservice branch may operate at a net loss when weighing a railroads request to discontinue such service. commuter service should be rendered where at all practicable. and  eliminated solely because it is run unprofitably. unless such an operation places an unreasonable burden on the financial stability of the entire railroad. i am very glad to see the kind of job the conferees did. especially in taking cognizance of the rights and interests of commuters. in this way the transportation act makes a positive contribution toward protecting the inter.ests of millions who depend daily on passenger commuter service. but  it is the duty of the congress to follow through with helping to get positive financial aid for those railroads which must continue to operate such services at substantial losses because it is deemed to be demanded by public convenience and necessity. some of such relief is provided in the bill and some of it will come from tax abatement. enactment of this measure would prove a powerful stimulus in persuading states and localities to offer forms of tax exemption and tax abatement to railroads operating essential but unprofitable commuter passenger services within their boundaries. they would do so in the realization that the beneficiaries of such assistance would be the railroads which need it to operate and that the federal government would  siphon off in increased federal taxes large portions of these funds. which previously fed state and municipal treasuries. the alternative to federal legislation of this kind is sitting back and watching the railroads and government authorities argue endlessly over failure to provide adequate passenger. especially commuter. services. demands for increased commuter fares. proposals for abrupt cancellations of commuter branch operations. and mounting losses that in many cases jeopardize the financial structure of the entire line. we can allow that to happen if we are to safeguard adequately the riding publics interest and that of the railroads. a vital element in our national transportation situation in our prosperity and in our defense. one can never draw a nice balance between the "break even" point and a slight profit. every municipality which wishes to give tax abatement can judge that question for itself. therefore we should  make it possible for a portion of the benefit resulting from local tax abatement to come back to the federal government in the form of increased federal taxes. this has been recommended in the smathers report. which i point out as a great landmark in this field. the public service commission of my own state of new york has come forward in favor of this kind of legislation. in a report entitled "report of investigation by the public service commission of the long island railroad." dated march 3. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point as a part of my remarks. a concurrent resolution adopted by the new york state legislature. memorializing congress to enact appropriate legislation affecting the railroad industry. which also deals with the proposed legislation which i am introducing today.
. i shall close by .citing as an example the long island railroad. to which i referred a moment ago. this railroad is the only line in the east which does  operate commuter service at a net loss thanks to tax forgiveness granted by the state and the city of new york. and the tax loss carryovers which exempt it from payment of federal income tax. however. in 1959. when this federal loss benefit has been exhausted. the earnings of the long island railroad will be taxed by the federal government at the rate of 52 percent. the federal treasury will then become the recipient under provisions of the present internal revenue code of much of the tax forgiveness  granted by the city and state. if that happens. serious doubts have been expressed on the feasibility of proceeding with plans to reduce fares and install new equipment for more efficient and safer passenger service. it is by  a wellkn fact that the east is exception. that commuter .service operates at a net loss almost everywhere in the nation. the icc will .be empowered under the approved bill to grant requests for cancellation where such service imperils the financial future of the railroads. overall operations. federal action taken promptly to encourage states and localities to grant tax relief to these lines will rescue many lines from precarious financial situations. permitting them better to serve the daily transportation needs of the nation. the commuter problem is a very grave problem throughout the entire country. in the transition period between great advances in the techniques of transportation. i feel that the kind of intermediate help which we are giving in the transportation act of 1958. and which is being given by states and cities. will be materially promoted by the enactment of the legislation which i am introducing today. i feel that it is so urgent that i hope it will have high priority attention from the committee on finance. which would be required were it to pass at this session.
. i support the amendment in the nature of a shbstitute as well as the amendment offered by the senator from michigan. this is a matter of longstanding discussion in the country. it affects particularly professional men and also selfemployed businessmen. i have in mind very particularly lawyers. who have given this proposal consideration for a very long time. and whc in their highest governing bodies have .3trongly favored some such plan as is proposed. we are dealing  only with theories. we are dealing with stern realities. as well. the fact is that at present tax rates there is a very exraordinary lack of incentive for a certain level of material earnings by person.3 in the professional fields. they really. in the final analysis. do  get their family security out of it. considering the present costs of living. we have  hesitated to deal with the tax on dividends ir. a special way. when we thought it would serve a proper purpose. neither have we hesitated to deal with the tax on medical expenses in a special way. a way which benefits persons having higher incomes. when we felt it would serve a particular purpose. in this particular situation. we are trying to find some formula by which to provide equity. in terms of retirement. for persons who work in professional fields. as contrasted with persons who work in industry. i think this subject. regardless of whether it has received thorough consideration by a committee of this body. has received a thorough hearing throughout the country in many professional bodies and in many debates and discussions. i think senators understand exactly what it implies. both socially and financially. many of the great professional bodiesi have in mind the lawyers particularlyhave expressed themselves very explicitly upon the need. in terms of their own professional and personal lives. of this kind of legislation. we have an opportunity to pass such legislation . it has been passed by the other body. justice to these groups longer need be deferred. in view of the fact that we have undertaken to exempt certain types of pension plans. and taken action in many other ways to accommodate other persons who have exactly the same problems. i hope the senate will see fit.  that we have been presented with the passage of h. r. 10 by the other body. to take affirmative action. either upon the proposal of the senator from oregon or the proposal of the senator from michigan.
. i should like the attention of the chairman of the committee. there is some question in the new york brokerage fraternity concerning the matter of puts and calls. i shall ask the senator the following questions: first. section 44 of h. r. 8381 makes a number of technical and clarifying changes relating to short sales. but it appears that changes were made with regard to puts. the present law continues a provision first adopted in the 1950 act designed to prevent tax avoidance through the use of short sales and defining a short sale as including a put. at the hearing it was urged that puts and short sales are quite different and should  be regarded as equivalent to one aher. it was suggested that it was possible to prevent tax avoidance through legislation in the form suggested without unnecessarily penalizing the purchaser of a put. does the failure of the committee to make any changes in present law regarding puts indicate that the suggestion was  acted upon by the committee or must the proponents of the change conclude it was rejected. second. taking into account the very technical nature of all legislation in this area. and the great difficulty in finding the solution that is fairest to both the taxpayers and the government. can this matter be studied so that the committee will be in position to act whenever technical amendments to the code are again under consideration.
would the senator say that the condition of the world. in terms of national security. does or does  indicate the need to retain flexibility in fiscal affairs. a flexibility of which the amendment tends to deprive us.
. a great deal has been said about the state of new york. on the facts and figures. i believe the state of new york should speak for itself. it is a fact that the power authority of the state of new york. a most reliable state commission. headed by bob moses. who. i believe. is well kn to many members of the senate. has made these findings about the power loss in the event this diversion takes effect for the calculated 3year period. the figures have already been stated. and i rise to verify them. the total revenue loss of the state of new york in power is estimated to be $1.268.204 in the event of a 3year diversion. if canada bears half the loss. and a loss of $2.536.408 if canada does  share half the cost. for that reason i shall support the amendment of the senator from michigan . reducing the period to 1 year. i shall also support the motion of the senator from michigan to table the bill. the state of new york feels very strongly on the subject. and has produced a very well documented case. withstanding my sympathy for the problems which have been explained to us tonight. i feel that the states position is the correct one. i took it when i was attorney general. i shall support it with my voice and vote in the senate.
. on behalf of myself. the senator from oregon . and the senator from indiana . i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to repeal the present 1 percent sales tax imposed in the district of columbia on food purchased for consumption in the home. this measure is being cosponsored in the other body by representative louis c. rabaut. of michigan. the bill would  affect the levy on restaurant meals. hearings were held on august 12. 1957. before the fiscal affairs subcommittee on the senate committee on the district of columbia. but action was taken. based on the asserted need for district of columbia revenue. this fiscal expedient is most unfortunate since the existing tax does  provide the revenue that had been originally anticipated. but. rather works a hardship on those who can least afford it. in addition. returns from other revenue sources. as revealed last year. exceed expectations. local revenue needs are  so demanding that bread and milk need be levied upon. some $2.25 million annually gained by the district of columbia food sales tax is most assuredly available in a less burdensome form and from sources where the cost of collection is  so high. from the disappointing receipts from this tax. it appears that this 1 percent levy is even more of a burden on lowincome families than elsewhere. for. to judge from the difference of more than $1 million in anticipated receipts. those who can afford to do so are crossing the district line to shop in nearby maryland and virginia where such tax is imposed. those who can afford to do this remain behind and pay the additional 1 percent. among the nations largest cities only in chicago. detroit. and st. louis. other than washington. is there a tax imposed on sales of food for offpremises consumption. new york. philadelphia. boston. los angeles. san francisco. atlanta. and new orleans. among others. have such tax. the tax loss contemplated by this bill is a little more than a tenth of the $20.5 million revenues anticipated under the general 2 percent sales tax imposed in washington and is only a very small portion of the some $250 million revenues anticipated for the district of columbia under its present budget for fiscal year surely alternate sources of moneys can be found for the capital city than this tax on food. services to its citizens and to the federal establishment rendered by the local government need be curtailed by the repeal of this levy. washington is one of the highest per capita income communities in the country and to impose upon its citizens less able to bear the burden a tax on their daily bread should be by means a necessity.
i like the senators analogy with respect to athens and sparta. this question has been worrying me very deeply. more and more we see indications of the seriousness of the situation. even those who might be irritated by whatever tax program we might develop. must realize that the choice is a very grim one. and that the choice may be between slavery or extinction. and the kind of society which we k and which we love so much. individual senators are  subject to as much pressure. in political terms. as members of the other body. they do  run quite so frequently. it seems to me that if a man serves his country here for 6 years superbly well. he should  be worried about whether he is to be reelected or . six years is ample time in which to spell out a basic contribution to our country and our time. i hope very much that more and more senators will encourage a realization on the part of the people of the country of the peril in which we stand. and the fact that the bill is  going to be paid by "him and her" but by "you and me." i think this is the body in which that can be done.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill granting to the physically handicapped the same $600 federal income tax exemption  given to the blind. an estimated half a million people would be eligible for the exemption under the legislation. by at least partially easing the present tax burden on these disabled persons. we shall help many of them to stay off public assistance rolls. thus encouraging them. as well as others benefited by the bill. to continue their efforts to become or remain selfsustaining. the u.s. department of health. education. and welfare reports that nearly 3 million persons under 64 years of age are afflicted by disabilities lasting for more than 6 months. it is further estimated that an additional 250.000 persons in this country become disabled each year. the loss in earning power sustained by those who become disabled. the medical costs. lengthy rehabilitational training periods. and any special equipment or devices necessary. put a severe drain on family finances. certainly these persons should be eligible for income tax consideration from the federal government at least to the extent called for in this bill. the proposed legislation. which would amend the internal revenue code of 1954. defines a physically handicapped person as one who. because of injury. disease. congenital deformity. or defect. is substantially handicapped in obtaining or keeping employment. is unable to get to and from a job on public transportation without undue hardship or danger. or must use a prosthetic device in this employment. the bill further provides that any taxpayer seeking this exemption must submit proof in support of his claim. the exemption will  be allowed to any taxpayer already entitled to the $600 exemption for blindness.
 of the new york state tax commission. before the senate committee on constitutional amendments. also a very interesting report made at the special request of the preceding gover of new york. the hoable averell harriman. which outlines the problem and states various types of adjustments which might be made.
 nixon and other authorities. that the private credit and investment system of the united states must be relied upon primarily to do the job which needs to be done. today we are investing overseas about $3.1 billion net. annually. the total stands at $28 billion. as revealed by the questionnaire to which i urgently invite the attention of every senator. business looks to the federal government.  for direct financial participation as a means of reducing the risks of trade and investment in the underdeveloped countriesthough in many cases business finds guarantees and similar techniques usefulbut the major thing for which business looks to the federal government is increased promotion and protection of our investments in foreign countries. improved information service. and. very important. equitable tax treatment. there is quite a conflict in the government between the treasury department and the department of state. upon aher occasion i shall address myself in great detail to that conflict. finally. business is interested in the expansion of investment guarantees. such as those  in the mutual security act. our objective must be to at least double united states private investment. businessmen themselves. by answers to the questionnaire to which i have referred. have shown us one of the ways by which to accomplish that purpose. i hope senators will pay very serious attention to this extremely important document.
s of the mutual insurance companies. so many of which. as i have said. are located in the state of new york. while they had rather strong reservations about the bill. to start with. apparently many of the things which troubled them in terms of their millions of policyholders were worked out in the bill. nevertheless. i feel it my duty. because of the tremendous incidence of this line of business in the state of new york. to state for the record some of their views as they gave them to me. first. they emphasized the fact that millions of individuals are affected through their savings which are in life insurance for their families and for their old age. the companies. acting as the trustees for those individuals. must be very careful to make certain that they are  taxed more heavily than any other form of thrift. and that this type of saving is  discouraged by excessive taxation. the group of mutual companies in new york. represented as i have just described. makes the following additional representations of fact: life insurance companies paid $292 million in federal taxes on 1957 business. under the tax formula then in effect. they would have paid $320 million for 1958. under the bill. the tax will soar to $500 million. this is a very substantial increase. and it is estimated that almost 70 percent of it will be paid by the mutual companies. the mutual companies point out also that they have alternative but to pass on the entire tax to the policyholders. in addition. again according to this groups estimate. the life insurance companies are paying some $300 million annually in state taxes. plus millions of dollars more for various licenses. fees. and in many other levys. apparently. the principal sticking point seems to be a proper allowance for dividends which the mutual companies credit to their policyholders. the mutual companies contend that dividends on mutual life insurance are simply partial refunds of premium payments. in way. they contend. are such dividends comparable to the dividends or shares of profits disbursed to stockholders by other types of companies. they allege that the allowance for dividends is built into the premiums on mutual policies. and that when such amounts are  needed they are returned to the policyholders. i have taken a considerable amount of time and interest in the problems of these insurance companies and have decided to support the bill because it seems to me to be a step in the direction of solving the recurring problems we have encountered in the taxation of life insurance companies. i appreciate. too. the fact that the stock companies themselves have very material complaints. they maintain that the total amount of taxes which they will have to pay will be increased substantially. they also claim that the bill contains other inequities. but i feel that in the future we can correct inequities which  appear in the bill or which may develop. i am persuaded that the important thing. in view of the relative balance which has been attained. is to have the bill passed by the senate and become law. i join with my colleagues in congratulating the distinguished senator from virginia . chairman of the committee on finance. who i k from my own experience with all the very distinguished insurance company leaders. has performed a monumental service in reconciling diverging points of view and in eliminating so many objections which seemed from time to time to be insurmountable.
. on february 2. 1959. i introduced for myself. for my colleague from new york. the distinguished present occupant of the chair . and for the distinguished senior senator from massachusetts . s. 858. a bill which would amend the internal revenue code in order to permit railroads to take full advantage of tax relief granted by states or municipalities by amending the internal revenue code to provide that the amount of such tax relief be exempt from federal income taxes. a report of the interstate commerce commission. docket  31954. in the proceeding entitled "railroad passenger train deficit." was published on may 18. 1959. after an investigation which extended more than 2 years. the report of the interstate commerce commission strongly endorses the amendment of the federal tax laws to encourage local and state tax relief "at least to the extent of disregarding state and local provided pretax net income for federal tax purposes." indeed. that is one of the nine specific suggestions made by the commission at the conclusion of its study. the discussion by the interstate commerce commission of this subject is so apt that i ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the record following these remarks. i hope very much it will be carefully considered by the members of the committee. because i think it supports markedly the proposed legislation to which i have referred.
i k that such calculations have been made. i have great faith also in the fact that what counts is  only what one owes. but also what one has. i am  concerned about the fact that we have a national debt of $285 billion. in round figures. if i also k that we are earning money and that we have assets in the country to meet it. that is the real issue. of course i am  advocating that we spend money we do  have to spend. however. i point out that this is money we can very well spend. i conclude on this e. i said that the half billion dollars have been "soaked up." applications are on hand which meet all the qualifications. and they will use up more than the money which will be provided. the senator from alabama is a great friend of housing. and i k i do  have to sell him on it.  am i trying to do so. i am trying to point out the reason why i shall support the conference report. i do  want to get caught between the difficulty of voting against it because we do  like it and at the same time voting with those who are against it because they think it is too much. because taking such a position might defeat it.
but the senator will e that the committee has cut the presidents own budget figure. certainly. when we have a program which is so desirable as this. with a budget allocation of $500.000 more than allowed by the bill. i do  think we are saving money which will help our country in the tremendous struggle in which we are engaged in the world by a savings of $500.000. i will say to the senator also that i understand something about legislation. as the senator ks. i have been in both houses of congress. in the house of representatives and in the senate. the senate will have to go to a conference with the house. and certainly my colleague. mr. rooney. will be tough about this matter. it is going to be necessary either to split off $1 million. if the item is $31/2 million. or it may be necessary. though i hope it will  be necessary. to split off a half million dollars.
it seems to me the time is short egh so that senators could listen for a few minutes. . i say that the leverage which is inherent in an additional number of millions of books to the people of the world is extremely important. we should  cut this item for what in terms of our budget is the minuscule sum of $500.000. again i repeat. this figure of $3 million represents a cut in the budget estimate. the $31/2 million figure does  represent an increase of the budget estimate.
s budget exceeded. on the contrary. i feel. as do so many of my colleagues. that the budget is entitled to most serious consideration. we want to hold everything we humanly can within the budget figure. indeed. we want to do it for less. if we possibly can. but i have a real conviction that the amount by which the budget is exceeded here represents really fruitful things which can be done in areas which are  sensational. but which are nevertheless extremely important and potent in respect to saving life. particularly in the case of the major diseases. however. i realize that there is grave disquiet about exceeding the budget by $186.325.000. in respect to the national institutes of health. i point out that in a very reasoned and sensible way. these funds can be made worthwhile. due to the cases which i have just described. which fall within the compass of my personal experience. i hope. therefore. that for sound and cogent reasons. hing capricious. and without any idea that some sensational breakthrough will occur by the expenditure of the money. but on a real breadandbutter basis. the senate will see fit to go along with the committee in respect to this appropriation.
. every effort should be made to maintain at full strength the lifesaving. lifegiving programs of unicef. into which have flowed. during the past decade. thousands of dimes and dollars from individual americans. in partnership with the u.s. government and 86 other countries. thousands of our citizens have been waging a global war against the ravages of disease. hunger. and privation which conspire to limit the life expectancy of more than onethird of the worlds population to less than 43 years. that unicef has become one of the truly exemplary selfhelp operations in modern history is evident in the report by the fund that for every $1 it sends into a country. the recipient government invests $2.50 in unicef programs for ecoic and social rehabilitation and development. although governments are the principal support of uniceftheir contributions totaled $20 million in 1958 with $11 million from the united statesthe continuation of individual participation in unicef through contributions from private u.s. citizens is vitally important. these dollars represent the positive expression of deep personal concern felt by the average american for the current welfare and the future security of an impoverished family or a diseased child thousands of miles away. this is one of the primary reasons behind this proposal introduced today to grant to contributions to unicef the same federal tax status already held by domestic charitable organizations. in april 1959. two constituents of mine who live in west hempstead. long island. called the problem to my attention by the following letter: dear senator: we understand the internal revenue bureau has ruled that contributions to unicef are  deductible on ones income tax return. this works a hardship  only for the dos but for the childrens fund. which is a very worthy charity. many contributors may be forced to cut down or eliminate their donations. this is a charity though handled through the u.n. we would appreciate your doing whatever you can to correct this ruling. respectfully yours.
the subject is civil defense. to which i shall address myself from time to time as we conclude this session. . the subject of civil defense is perceptibly before us right  through speeches and articles by our colleague. the junior senator from ohio . who is devoting a good deal of his attention to this specific issuegenerally disapproving of our civil defense preparationsand by the fact that presently there is in conference the matter of appropriations for the office of civil defense mobilization. a difference exists between the house and senate in conference. involving the restoration of $15 million to provide the full budget estimate of $25 million for federal contributions on a matching basis. which is an outward manifestation of our whole attitude toward this subject. for this reason i intend to speak rather briefly today. and later in full detail. in the hope that such discussion will assist in securing improvement. i believe it would be well to start today on preparations right here at home. in the capitol itself. the particular branch of the subject to which i wish to address myself today is: what is the congress itself doing about civil defense. civil defense is getting to be a topic much like the weathereveryone talks about it but one does much about it. as we increase our military defense preparations. as we state the ways in which we can agree to ease tensions and reaffirm the determination of our people to stand up to the communist threat. we seem to progress from chipping away to hacking away at our military defense. the apathy toward civil defense which we think of as being indicative of the attitude of the general publicand an apathy about which i have my doubtsmay well be. i believe. a reflection of apathy in the congress. for example. how many members k what is the bell signal for a civil defense drill or an actual disaster. how many of us are just as well satisfied that the congress has never been subjected to the "discomfiture" of an air raid test drill as have been entire communities and the executive departments of the government. is exempting ourselves from civil defense exercises the leadership in saving their very lives which we offer to the american people. do we exempt ourselves from shipboard boat drills or transocean plane ditching drills. . if due to our own lack of real concern hereas manifested to the nation by our own unpreparedness in civil defensewe should suffer the consequences and the nation be leaderless. it would of course be a personal disaster to each of us. but infinitely more serious through our own shortsightedness here there may be nation to lead.
. i have recast the budget because the analysis shows that at least $20.5 billion of budget expendituresin other words. about onefourth of the expenditure of $82.5 billion for 1960are of a capital investment nature. in short. these expenditures add to the fundamental wealth of the taxpayers of the nation. it can be considered money which is productive. on the contrary. it is money which is extremely productive. if we deduct $20.5 billion. we reduce the budget to $62.5 billion. which is well below the intake and takes care of any kind of budget excess which we might have. if we really do the things we have to do. i emphasize this because the american people should  be panicked by the idea that the budget. and every figure in it. represents the answer to inflation. it does . it depends on what the money will be spent for. when we have $20 billion in productive expenditures in a budget calling for the expenditure of $82.5 billion. we are  in any iminediate danger of having the budget contribute to an inflationary situation. on the contrary. we have a little leeway in respect of the government doing certain things which must be done. as in the case of housing. which i analyzed a yew minutes ago.
the senator and i may disagree. but the fact is that what we owe is always to be set off against what we have. the fact that our aggregate debt has increased from $650 billion to $850 billion does  mean what it sounds like. in view of the fact that the gross national product and the national disposable income have increased by an even greater proportion. there is one point of agreement between myself and the senator from delaware. whom i admire greatly. as he ks. and that is with respect to the tax question withstanding our different views about expansion and productivity. and various kinds of operations abroad. the fact is that we are as one on the proposition that we must pay for what we get. i thoroughly agree with the senator on that point. those of us who voted on the floor of the senate for the 2/2cent gasoline tax increase the other day were only being honest with ourselves. i do  feel that we must balance the budget every year in a cold war. we may have to go along with cyclical balance over a period of time. but one thing is clear. namely. that we must close the tax loopholes and levy the necessary taxes to come at least within a measurable distance of paying the bill. those of us who think we are liberal in our attitudes on social questions. foreign aid. and so forth. must face up to the proposition of being willing to vote the necessary taxes to pay the bill. i say this to the senator because i think he deserves it. in view of his attitude in being hardheaded about money.
i k that my colleague from wisconsin wishes to participate. i have only one further important but brief observation. there are some things. like the question of the depreciation policy with respect to machinery. or the question raised by the boggs bill. to encourage oversea private investment. with respect to which the government itself. in a sense. is making a little investment only to get back more at the end. in connection with which there may be a difference of opinion. what we are both talking about is a straight tax reduction situation. in which the money is foregone. in terms of taxes. i agree with the senator thoroughly in his concept of fiscal responsibility. that if liberals like myself wish to vote for programs. we should measure them against the cost. and see that they are paid for. even though we all k that taxes are unpopular.
the whole burden of my speech today was the proposal of a $25 billion issue of peace bonds. withstanding our differences in policy concerning particular measures. i am gratified to k that the senator from delaware and i think alike on this particular subject. i used the framework of "peace bonds" because it enables the government to change the interest rate and change the term of savings bonds. it will lend impetus to patriotism. which is inherent in the cold war. i think the antiinflationary effect of putting this body of longterm debt on the individual investor is so great that it represents a major aspect of our victory in the cold war. a victory in real terms of wellbeing and peace for the world. i am  asking the senator to join me in my thesis. but i express my gratification to him for his reasoning. i k he will forgive me for saying this. he is a conservative. we are proud to have him as a great conservative in the republican party. it leads him to much the same point as do my views. which are on the liberal side. especially in social welfare measures. lead me. but against the hard rock of fiscal responsibility i think this is something very eworthy to the american people. and i thank my colleague for having told me and for mentioning it.
i am glad the senator has spoken of that particular situation. because i put a table in the record in connection with my remarks which shows that the proportion of peoples savings which the united states is getting in savings bonds is at a new alltime low. withstanding the fact that savings in private savings and loan institutions. amounting to $48 billion. are at a new alltime high. the participation of the public in the disposition of savings through the purchase of savings bonds has fallen. whereas their participation in savings and loan associations. commercial savings and mutual savings banks. has risen. the main beneficiary being the savings and loan associations. i join the senator in his remarks and i have heretofore made the proposal i have recounted. we must have a realistic interest rate. we have to have terms and conditions. some witnesses before our joint ecoic committee even advocated some form of tax exemption in order to make the bonds more attractive.
i have been urging that we issue $25 billion worth of peace bonds. i should like to join with the senator from delaware. and to recommend that if we do make such an issue and try to sell it as a major patriotic issue. as we did the war bondsand i hope we willwe do so in terms as specified by the senator from delaware. . i think the senator from delaware has established an excellent formula. a 4 percent compound interest rate and a uniform 10year term. i have been sitting through the hearings of the joint ecoic committee. of which our colleague from illis is such a gracious chairman. the witnesses have constantly agreed when i have questioned them about the whole peace bond idea. i  hope very much that the terms specified by the senator from delaware will be carried through. there is very little we could do. both in terms of the antiinflation struggle and in terms of the stability of our longterm debt and the ultimate interest rate we have to pay. that could be more important than. first. stopping the attrition of the cashins to which the senator so eloquently referred. which exceeded by a billion dollars a year the purchases of savings bonds. and. second. getting the longterm debt held in the hands of those who should hold it. the savers in the united states. i think the modest amount of competition to savings and loan associations. to savings banks. and to other recipients of savings. would be as hing compared to the stability of the dollar which would come from having this kind of government obligation held by the individual investors. if the senator from delaware will accept my aid. i shall be delighted to join with him in this effort. which apparently has to start in this chamber. because we have  had too much encouragement so far from the administration in regard to really getting a massive drive going for an intelligent kind of policy on bonds which the savers can buy. as outlined by the senator from delaware. which i strongly urge be the peace bond issue.
i will say to the senator from delaware. we should  forget. because it has been brought out in the testimony. the tremendous antiinflationary effect achieved by the longterm debt being in the hands of the savers. of the people who divert their money for savings instead of spending it at the particular moment. that is. spending deferred for the future. which can be of tremendous advantage in the antiinflationary struggle.
. aside from the courts. how about administrative relief. the secretary of health. education. and welfare wrote to the chairman of the committee on public works on june 1. 1959. that a study could be undertaken of the "sewage treatment problems of the metropolitan sanitary district of greater chicago without any actual increase in the present diversion of water from lake michigan." such a study. without increased diversionwhich is really the purpose of this legislationcould well be undertaken under public law 680 of the 84th congress: the water pollution control act amendments of 1956. i see indication that this administrative approach has ever been tried or that the public health service has ever been approached on it. my concern with the effect of the pending measure. which would permit a 1year. 1.000cubicfeetpersecond diversion of water from lake michigan. on our relations with canada. which we discussed a little while ago. is  based on conjecture. but on very clear statements of the canadian government. es from the canadian government on february 20. 1959. april 9. 1959. and again just last week. on august 21. 1959. make this quite clear. on the domestic side of this problem. too. there exists strong evidence against this proposal. there is first the question of the adverse effect on navigation on the st. lawrence seaway. which has just been opened at a cost of $450 million. of which the u.s. share was $130 million. every cubic foot of water diverted at chicago is lost for navigation on the st. lawrence and the other great lakes channels. in shipping which measures capacity in terms of a few inches clearance over the sills of the many great lakes. an inch loss of water means thousands of dollars in navigational losses. but the losses which will be incurred by the other great lakes states and canada as a result of this test diversion alone cover so many areas that they can be measured in fiscal terms. just one aspectthat of lost power productionshould make it clear how this supposedly mi diversion really hits the pocketbooks of the other states and their peoplewhile. it is most interesting to e. it actually results in an increase in power revenues to the state of illis. to whom we are supposed to do a favor by the proposed legislation. the committee report indicates. and we seriously challenge the statement as i shall show in a minute. that the estimated power loss to new york from a 1year test diversion would be approximately $608.000. but that this would be offset by the $67.000 gain by the lockport. ill.. plant. that gain by illis will be small compensation to the new yorkers who have less power and who will have to pay more for what they do get. even the figure of $608.000 used in the committee report is based on obsolete data in the 1957 army engineers report. and the reason why it is obsolete is that it was made prior to the completion of the great international power development on the international rapids section of the st. lawrence. and assumed the niagara falls project to be 1 year further in the future than it actually will be. we expect its completion by 1961. our clear and we believe absolutely fully valid estimate of the revenue loss to the state of new york in terms of power is $1.125.800 all of which. under the terms of the treaties controlling water use. will very probably have to be borne by the new york power authority. indeed if the power lost had to be replaced by the more expensive steamgenerated power at modern steamplants. the cost would be $1.583.600. these figures contain conjecture about whether all the water would be used or 100 percent of the flow in the st. lawrence river at international rapids goes through the turbines except the water used in the seaway locks. and 100 percent of the niagara water will be so used. again through turbines. except for the minimum day and night flow for the falls also provided for by treaty with canada. and in addition to the losses. the senate should be aware of the fact that canada has an additional 100percentuse plant lower on the river. where it is completely within canadathe beauhars. quebec. plantwhich would suffer comparable losses. incidentally. and i say this parenthetically. it only emphasizes our discussion of a minute ago of the reaction of the canadian public and the canadian parliament and the canadian government to the losses which we will impose upon them in terms of their solicitude for us when it comes to diversion of the columbia river. about which my colleague from oregon spoke so well. the lost capacity. according to the power authority engineers would be egh to serve about 6.000 or 7.000 people at the average u.s. per capita installation capacity. but taking the power area alone. a requirement that the sanitary district recompense the power authority of new york for lost revenues would  cure the problem. though i understand that the bills sponsors would oppose even that. for such compensation would  take into account the loss to the power consumers who have to do without additional capacity. the higher cost of power even if they may be able to secure it elsewhere. the possible effect on industry which has moved into the st. lawrence river area because of the availability of properly priced power and the employment opportunities that industry offers in that area. the effect on navigation on the new st. lawrence seaway and the cost of additional dredging that a drop in water level would require. all these factors are  even taken into account in the figures i have mentioned as the direct dollar loss. in conclusion. i strongly believe that there should be legislation on this subject by the congress at this time. the present arrangement is already a compromise. in my opinion. on the one hand. the states facing the great lakes. including new york. believe that the present diversion. which is constantly increasing because domestic pumpage is exempt from existing limitations. should be reduced by requiring the chicago sanitary district to return to lake michigan such water after it has been properly treated. that is the subject of the litigations  pending in the supreme court. which have  been referred to judge mars as a special master. on the other hand. the sanitary district wishes to increase the existing diversion of lake michigan water through this legislation and its eventual purpose of permanence. i believe that the supreme court is still the proper forum for this matter which has been handled by it for such a substantial period of time. so. on the ground that there is an adequate forum. with adequate flexibility. which has shown its capability for dealing with this subjectnamely. the u.s. supreme courton the ground that it would cause great mischief between ourselves and canada. and violate direct relationships upon which the canadians had every right to depend. so far as we are concerned. and fly in the face of vigorously asserted candian protests as recently as a week ago. and finally. on the ground that it would unfairly take from the other states their property in a real sense. in terms of money and in terms of intangibles which can be compensated for with money. i respectfully submit that we would be making a great mistake in enacting the proposed legislation. on the procedural side. if we enact the proposed legislation we shall let ourselves in for becoming the arbiter between the state of illis. the chicago sanitary district. and all the other states on the great lakes. once we pass this measure chicago will k that this is the place to come whenever it wants something with respect to great lakes water. every senator can be sure that this is where such battles would be fought out. i doubt very much whether we think that is a good idea. so i hope very much that the senate will turn down this particular measure as very unwise and unfair to the neighboring states.
is it the theory of this measure that it is a bracketin other words. that. on the one hand. it prevents taxation when there is just ordertaking. without order acceptance. and. on the other hand. taxation is permitted when there is a corporation. incorporated under the laws of a state. or an individual who is domiciled in that state. and that. in between. the various questions or the range of questions are still left to court adjudication. as in the present way.
i should like to express my support of the amendment. . food can be an extremely important item with respect to enabling countries which are  industrialized to industrialize. both by taking people off the land and. for the moment. using them as the communists do. by reducing the standard of living in order to bring about industrialization through reduction of consumption. or. as we propose. by giving the people the margin of food which they need. i think in the same spirit the philosophy of the people and their understanding of what they are working for. and why. would be contributed to by adoption of the amendment. which would give the ideological background for food for peace. which i like. and for which i voted. i hope very much the senate will see fit to agree to the amendment.
. i should like to ask the senator one other question. would the senator feel that. in fairness in the situation. the treasury department ought to make a special drive. if given the increased interest rate opportunity. to sell more savings bonds.
. i ask unanimous consent to include as a part of my remarks certain excerpts from the statement of secretary anderson on public debt management. made by him before the house ways and means committee in his testimony on june 10. 1959. bearing out the general thesis which i have just mentioned.
. i wish to be heard briefly on the pending motion. i served as attorney general of my state. although i appreciate the pleasant nature of the debate which has occurred in regard to this matter. i believe the problem involved is far more fundamental. i believe that the fundamental legal question involved is of such character that the senate would make a great mistake if it failed to adopt the amendment of the senator from massachusetts . which i have had the ho to cosponsor. and if it failed to reject the amendment of the senator from new hampshire . my reason for taking that position is that it is one thing to try to change the ground rules under which relations between residents and the states in which they work shall be handled. i wish to call the attention of the senate to the fact that only recently the senate did exactly that. in the case of businesses which operate interstate. but engage in some intrastate activities. a bill to that effect was recently passed by the senate. it is one thing to do that. and i think in that respect the congress is proceeding on perfectly sound ground. but it is quite aher thing to provide that. withstanding a lawful state tax law. the federal government shall  be a party to helping enforce that state law. if we were to take such a position. i believe we would get into many contradictions and many difficulties. yet that is the fundamental purport of this proposal. the federal government is seeking. by means of a withholding statute which relates to cooperdtion between the federal government and the state governments. to change the rules in regard to what a state will be allowed to do by way of taxation. it will be argued that the fact that the federal government does  withhold. does  necessarily mean that the tax will  be collected. however. i think we k well egh. from the experience in connection with the collection of taxes. that if taxes are  withheld. to a great extent they will  be paid. somehow or other. to the taxing authority. therefore. i believe agreements should be made with respect to such compactswhich. incidentally. do  affect a great many states. of course new york has a very material problem on this score. in a moment. i shall submit details in regard to how new york. new jersey. and connecticut are trying to attack this problem. aher way to attack it would be for the congress to pass a bill of the kind it passed the other day for the benefit of business firms which felt that under a supreme court decision. they were being unjustly penalized. because of that situation. the senate passed a bill which i believe could properly be described as a bracket bill. in other words. it provided for both a minimum and a maximum. so there would be some assurance that an interstate concern could proceed to do some intrastate business. without being subject to the tax. that arrangement would be perfectly legal. and i have reason to say that congress should  act in such a manner in such a situation. if it feels that it wishes to help solve that difficulty. but i believe the approach made by means of this bill would inhibit the collection of the tax. without resulting in adjudication as to any of the equities as between the state government and the federal government. the necessity for taking action in that situation has been made clear by my colleague [mr. keatingi. of course. one who earns his living in a certain state. receives various governmental services from that state. even though in a legal sense he does  actually live there. if he maintains his residence in aher state. i do  believe the senator from new hampshire is even satisfied with the definition of "resident" which is contained in the bill. he wishes to include an even tighter definition with respect to the abode or the actual place of residence of the person involved. if the proposed statute were enacted. i believe we would be avoiding the assumption of our proper responsibility. which is to arrive at an adjudication in regard to how much a state is permitted to tax a resident. but at the same time we would be failing to exert our proper authority in regard to the question of withholding. and our failure to take that action would immediately mean that a state involved in such a situation would lose much of the taxes which it should receive.
first. i should like to explain my amendment. so as to make clear that it does  call for an increase in the amount provided by this part of the bill. i am endeavoring to provide an appropriation for 1961 for the development loan fund. it will be ed that the bill provides an appropriation of $590 million for the fiscal year 1960. all my amendment seeks to have appropriated is $500 million for 1961. first. let me make clear that there is legislative authority for doing that. the mutual security act provides more than adequate authorization for both the year 1960 and the year 1961. in the second place. this amendment calls for complying with part of the request made by the administration to the appropriations committee. which request the appropriations committee has turned down. indeed. the committee report makes that very clear. and says in so many words that the committee turns down the request for an appropriation. for the year 1961. of $500 million for the development loan fund. let me refer my colleagues specifically to page 5 of the committee report: the $500 million requested to be appropriated . to become available in fiscal 1961. has been denied. . i ask unanimous consent that there be incorporated in the record as a part of my remarks a summary of the development loan fund proposals and commitments by geographical area as of june 30. 1959.
i am a member of the joint ecoic committee. i have iced something which may interest the senator. and i.would appreciate the senators comment upon it. it seems to me that what is being attempted here is to hold down the result of the diseaseinflation and high interest rateson the theory that that will cure the situation. whereas. as a matter of fact. it may have exactly the opposite effect. as the senator has described. the senator will agree that many of us. including myself. have objections to the way in which monetary and fiscal policy has been handled. we believe that if it had been handled differently. the result might have been lower interest rates. however. the fact is that to try to correct the situation in this way is only worsening it. because we are trying to prevent the issue from breaking out and the situation being sooner remedied. we are kidding ourselves. that is exactly what is being done by those who think they are going to bring about lower interest rates. because they frustrate the process. and the result is higher rates.
. i introduce for myself. for the distinguished senior senator from illis as the principal cosponsor. and 22 other senators. whose names i shall read into the record. a bill to eliminate by statute the poll tax and other taxes or property qualifications as a bar to voting in national elections. i introduce the bill as an original measure and also as a substitute for senate joint resolution 126. a proposed constitutional amendment to do away with the poll tax. which was introduced in the last session of congress. seventeen senators who previously supported senate joint resolution 126 have  joined as cosponsors of the measure i am introducing today. which would substitute for that constitutional amendment a statutory means to achieve the same objective. the senators who have joined with the senator from illis and myself are the following: the senator from colorado . the senator from alaska . the senator from maryland . the senator from connecticut . the senator from new jersey . the senator from idaho . the senator from pennsylvania . the senator from kentucky cvi----5 . the senator from michigan . the senator from minnesota . my colleague. the junior senator from new york . the senator from hawaii . the senator from minnesota . the senator from oregon . the senator from utah [mr. moss]. the senator from montana . the senator from maine . my colleague. the junior senator from new york . the senator from oregon . the senator from rhode island . the senator from wisconsin . the senator from pennsylvania . who is the present distinguished occupant of the chair. the senator from new jersey . and the senator from ohio .
. that this amount of money barely begins to scratch the surface of the potential of the tax deductible sums of money which could be devoted to education. and i hope that corporations will take a lesson from sam newhouse and will themselves be more munificent. as they should be. in their support of higher education.
. i must say i am at some loss to understand why this proposal is being tacked onto the unfinished business. the proposed constitutional amendment. and why it could  stand on its own. i see advantage in this approach. i only see that it will complicate the situation. and make people feel that an effort is being made to make the amendment process tougher. i have qualms myself about what i shall do. certainly. in my opinion. it will be in the national interest. i am confident that if what i shall propose is successful and results in substituting what i shall propose to substitute for the whole joint resolution. we can come back to the kefauver proposal at any time. with problems at all. i repeat. i am at a loss to understand why so important a matter as a constitutional amendment to eliminate the poll tax and its alternative. which i will urge. of a law to eliminate the poll tax. should  be considered and debated on its own. i am at a loss to understand why it has to be fastened on as a tail to a joint resolution as to which. in this body. i do  believe there is any disagreement. and which certainly could be in a very pleasant way. without the problems which are  involved. considered on its own.
. i have quarrel with my colleagues from florida. the procedure he has adopted is something of which he has availed himself. as any member could. i might quarrel on this subject with the leadership. at least. i have made a request for an explanation from the leadership. and  from the senator from florida. as to the factual situation. it will be my intention. when the amendment of the senator from florida shall have been disposed of. to offer a substitute for the entire joint resolution. which substitute will provide for the elimination of the poll tax by statute. the senate will then be faced. in a perfectly parliamentary way. with the very clear alternative of a law or a constitutional amendment. it seems almost inconceivable that this question should . in the most deliberate way. be submitted to the senate. and it seems almost inconceivable that it should  be the subject of thorough exploration and a wellconsidered vote. let me say . in order that there may be mistake about it. that whatever one member can do to bring about a record vote on this particular question will be done by me. we all k that it is  within the competence of one member to bring that about. but i wish to make my view upon that subject unmistakably clear .
i certainly do  so contend. i believe perhaps the senator was  present in the chamber when i entered my protest. the parliamentary situation is such that the only recourse i have in order to raise the question is to offer my proposal as a substitute for the entire joint resolution. i was pointing out that this is  in prejudice to the kefauver proposal. which is reported from a committee. and which the leadership could bring up at any time. it should  be permitted to prevent the perfectly unqualified. unencumbered decision by the senate on the question whether it chooses to bring about the elimination of the poll tax by a constitutional amendment or by a statute. i do  see that my proposal would in any way prejudice the kefauver proposal. i was protesting the way the leadership has brought up the kefauver proposal and sought to tack an amendment onto it. as i say. i have quarrel with the senator from florida. he has an absolute right to do what he has done. i do  quarrel with him at all. but the procedure adopted does result in the necessity of approaching the subject in this way.
it was written by janice e. christiansen. instructor in government. university of texas. author of "the constitutionality of proposed national legislation to abolish the poll tax as a requirement for voting in national elections". the thesis being on file in the university of minnesota library. 1946.
there are many senators. including myself. who represent states having large taxpaying responsibilities. the money comes from the taxpayers somehow. and it must be paid in somebodys dollars. i think we have tried in our amendment. as we have drafted it. to balance all those equities in a way which. for example. is very fair to my state. fair to california. and fair to other large states. at the same time does its utmost for the states which really need help. to continue.  has set forth in his budget and the proposal he has made to congress. of all the arguments. probably. upon this subject. once it is granted that our amendment will do the joband i certainly think we have proved beyond a question of doubt that it willthe important point is. can our proposal become law. that is the second most telling factor. there. i think. we have far and away the better of the argument over the committee bill.
the estimate mally made is that new york pays approximately 19 percent of the federal tax bill. which means that new york would pay approximately $100 million of the $500 million. under the committee bill. new york would receive $24 million. in other words. new york would get back. in round figures. approximately from onefourth to onethird of what it would pay in federal taxes.
i thank my colleague. i think that is the explanation we have all been looking for. there is. in short.  simply a mathematical addition. but there is a somewhat greater weighting for the flat capitation figure. i think my colleague answered that. . i wish to conclude my own views on this matter. as i say. there is a real struggle between the large taxpaying states in regard to the payment of taxes and the need for helping our brethren in other states. who have deep educational problems. with their other problems. from my point of view. and i think from the point of view of my state. the guarantee of bond interest and principal was much the preferable course. it was a rifle shot at a clear target. we are  getting into the shotgun approach. etheless. i am committed to federal aid to education upon some reasonable basis. i think the senator from south dakota has given us in the large taxpaying states a more reasonable way in which to deal with this problem. with full flexibility and amplitude to our brother states who need it the most. than is provided by the clark amendment. and i shall therefore support the amendment of the senator from south dakota .
. first. to show what is happening in this particular situation. we have the rather interesting example in prince edward county. va.. where all public education has been ended. and where white pupils are attending what is euphemistically called private schools. there the tax rate has been reduced by approximately 50 percent in order to accommodate citizens who may be able to use these funds to pay for the schooling of their children in these socalled private schools. only as recently as this morning we read in the washington post that the virginia senate has enacted legislation which will give tax credits on contributions to private schools in areas where public schools have been desegregated. the resulting situation in prince edward county is that there is public education at all. and that 1.700 negro children in the county have opportunity to attend public schools. as a matter of fact. some effort is being made to give the negro children some kind of informal training. i cite that only as evidence of the fact that law and the backing of law is essential in this situation. that it is a deteriorating situation. a situation which must be won in terms of public policy of our country. as declared by the supreme court. i ask unanimous consent that the report from this mornings washington post may be included in my remarks at this point.
. while we are arguing civil rights. we must  forget that the world is in a great crisis. accordingly. i introduce for appropriate reference. a bill to authorize the establishment of labormanagement productivity councils in individual plants and communities throughout the united states under the direction of a bureau of productivity councils. to be created in the executive branch and jointly administered by the secretaries of commerce and labor. a lengthening productivity lag between the united states and the u.s.s.r. is potentially just as dangerous as a missile lag in the next few years. and the consequences to our national security can be equally severe. our emous resources of manpower. material. and techogy realized under the u.s. private enterprise system should be harnessed voluntarily by management. labor. and the community through local productivity councils to boost our national productivity rate in order to first. keep u.s. exports competitive in world markets as we seek to expand world trade. second. continue the improvement of the average standard of living in the united states. third. curtail serious work stoppages due to failures in labormanagement relations. and fourth. counter inflationary pressures in the ecoy. during world war ii. some 5.000 labormanagement councils contributed to the war effort and that experience can form the basis for a tremendous new effort . these productivity councils. to be made up of representatives of labor and management and appropriate representatives of local government. would have as their primary goals increasing u.s. productivity. fostering better labormanagement relations. preparing for the introduction of necessary automation. and dealing with the problems of workers affected by it. promoting greater diversification of skills through the development of apprenticeship and other training programs. and reviewing and helping to revise local ordinances such as building codes to keep them responsive to techogical advancement and modern conditions. additional duties of these councils would be to improve worker morale. promote employee health and safety. help to meet community needs resulting from ecoic influences by providing joint organization. planning and action. and to help to provide adequate transportation for the labor force. in the past decade u.s. work stoppages due mainly to labormanagement disputes totaled up to some 340 million mandays losta figure which is equal to some $15.6 billion worth of u.s. production. that staggering figure is almost as much as we spent on ecoic aid to underdeveloped nations during the 1950s. and excluding research expenditures. it is equivalent to the entire production cost of our missile program for the last decade. it is five times what we spent on federal aid to higher education to help develop the kind of scientific and techogical talents in such heavy demand in a space age. and it is 10 times what the federal government has invested in its program to stem urban decay through slum clearance and rehabilitation in u.s. urban areas. if much of this productivity loss is to be averted in the 1960s. labormanagement relations will have to be improved. and what better way to start than at the local productivity council grassroots level. often injurious to this relationship has been the rapid development and sometimes hasty introduction of automation in u.s. industry. and yet automation remains a prerequisite to the growth of real output per manhour and to the u.s. competitive position. in this context. the productivity councils would explore means to eliminate the displacement or other adverse effects on employees through retraining. job shifting. and relocation. as well as by setting up incentives to enlist the employees experience and cooperation proper conditions in developing production. this bill would permit the newly created bureau of productivity councils to establish  more than 10 field offices. to utilize the services and facilities of the departments of commerce and labor and other government agencies and of outside groups and experts. and to supply technical and administrative assistance to industries. labor groups. and communities desirous of establishing productivity councils. an executive director would head up the bureau specifically charged with implementation of the employment act of 1946 and its national policy declaration that it is the responsibility of the federal government to help marshal u.s. resources "to promote maximum employment. production. and purchasing power." the joint ecoic committees thorough and farreaching study. "comparisons of the united states and soviet ecoies." states that in the u.s.s.r. the per capita share of the gross national product has grown at an annual rate two and a half times faster than ours in the united states for the years 1950 through 1957. then the 1958 recession coupled with last years steel strike further depressed our annual growth rate for the entire decade. reasonable estimates give the russians a growth rate about twice our own in the 1960 decade. our gross national product is. however. well over twice theirs. . there is much boasting by the russian leaders about how fast they will overtake us in the real output of many products. despite their claims that will  happen very soon. but we ige the sharp differential in the two ecoies growth rates at our own peril. the communist regime in the u.s.s.r. has repeatedly made clear that it is engaged in a ruthless ecoic war against the united states and the free world industrialized nations. and  communist china is plowing back everything  required barely to keep its population alive and working into massive industrialization. if we continue to accept our going productivity rate with complacency. it will still take some decades for the u.s.s.r. to equal our present standards of living. but by that time. the frontiers of freedom may have shrunk too dangerously. for the impressive industrial drive forward of soviet russia in the last 30 years. and  communist china. is contrived to win. first. the admiration and. second. the emulation of hundreds of millions in asia. the mideast. and africa to the ruthless ecoies that accomplished it withstanding the deathknell the communist system sounds for human dignity and freedom. uneducated. unskilled. and hungry peoples by the millions may be lured by the communists should th worlds industrialized democracies fail to meet the productivity challenge of such consequence to less developed nations. the labormanagement councils enlisted some 7 million labor members during world war ii. in contrast to the variation of assignments handled by those groups. the productivity councils provided for in my legislation would have as their  1 responsibility devising ways and means in cooperation with employer. employee. and community representatives to increase individual plant output and overall productivity in a community. this concept has been adopted by several of the western nations like england. west germany. france. italy. finland. and austria. particularly good results have been ed in way. denmark. and sweden. in sweden. an atmosphere of trust between business and labor is a national goal greatly helped by the labormanagement committees which are voluntary in nature. but almost universal in application with schools set up to promote labormanagement relations and to tackle mutual production problems. our production must be adequate for our own living standards. for the necessary massive defense. for the competitive race in science. and techogy and for giving egh help to the less developed areas to achieve a rate of development reasonably acceptable to their peoples. we are entering a period in our national history when selfdiscipline by the component parts of our ecoy. including the consumers. must be practiced in the interests of spurring national productivity rates over the present plateau to new heights which can bring increased prosperity without spiraling inflation at home and a more stable peace abroad. in this effort the local productivity council can presage a new era in labormanagement relations imperative to the achievement of that objective. i ask unanimous consent that the bill may be printed at this point in the record.
. i wish to join with others of my colleagues in commemorating the birthdays of emanuel celler. of new york. and john taber. of new york. respectively. our senior democrat and republican in the new york state congressional delegation. the depth of my affection for these men has been one of the great pleasures of my congressional career. emanuel celler. though of the other party from mine. has joined with me and i with him in many struggles in the house of representatives. especially for civil rights and civil liberties. his devotion to the best possible relations between the united states and israel. and the great meaning of that objective to so many of our people in new york. are very well kn. i pay him the highest tribute today for the many years of hoable service. in which he has fought many fights so worthwhile for our country. matter what might be our differences on policy which have arisen in the interim. as to mr. jon taber. there are few who are as useful to our country. at his present ripe age of 80. his keen sense of protection of the financial situation of the country is legendary in the house of representatives. and indeed. in the united states. our nation owes him a great debt of gratitude. and i hope one will be confused by particular questions of policy when they are compared to the emous service john taber has rendered to our country as a watchdog of the treasury. i also pay tribute to the warmth of personality of mr. taber. whose friendship i have enjoyed during all the years since i first came to the house of representatives.
 george washington to serve as the first secretary of the treasury. all of us who make our home there today feel an especially keen duty to see to it that the hamilton grange. the only home that hamilton ever built and owned. should be saved and restored to the architectural masterpiece that it once was. this house was built by hamilton following his retirement from public service. as one of our most famous founding fathers. hamiltons contributions began with his service as a delegate from new york to the annapolis convention in 1786. where he drafted the report which led to the convening of the constitutional convention in the following year. he worked tirelessly for the ratification of the constitution. he wrote more than half of the "federalist papers." and won. almost singlehanded. the support of the new york convention. despite heavy opposition. from 1789 to 1795. when he served as secretary of the treasury. he established the u.s. fiscal system. and he is well remembered for his strong emphasis on federal fiscal responsibility. when he resigned from the cabinet. he resumed law practice in new york. and he was living at the hamilton grange in 1804. the year when he was fatally shot in a duel with aaron burr. the grange is one of seven buildings still standing in new york city which represents the architecture of the federal period. it was. in fact. designed by the same architect who was responsible for the city hall. today it is wedged between a church and an apartment house on convent avenue near 141st street. in upper manhattan. in the 21st congressional district which i represented for many years. it has been moved once from its original location. and it has been necesary to remove all the interior pieces to museums for safekeeping. the american scenic & historic preservation society. which owns the house. has been unable to raise egh funds to undertake the restoration necessary. but the city authorities have agreed to provide a suitable site for the grange on the grounds of city college. if a way is found to move it. therefore. the time has come when assistance from the federal government is clearly needed. in this connection. it is very important to e that the advisory board on the national parks. historic sites. buildings. and monuments to the secretary of the interior some years ago declared "the hamilton grange worthy of preservation." it approved it as having "exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the united states." it also recommended that the home be given further consideration from the standpoint of suitability for addition to the national park system. under the terms of the joint resolution i am introducing. hamiltons home would be designated as "the hamilton grange national monument and shall be set aside as a public national memorial to commemorate this historic role played by alexander hamilton in the establishment of this nation." this measure would authorize the secretary of the interior to take such action as may be necessary to establish this national monument. and would authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be required to preserve this historic american site. the new skyscrapers which seem to leap into the new york city skyline and the sounds of modern construction have  made new yorkers forget our great historical heritage. federal aid to help new york city preserve the historic home of this truly great american is very much desired in new york. the name of alexander hamilton will never be missing from our history books. and the landmark which once was his home should  disappear from the sidewalks of new york city.
. i have just received from the treasury department a monthlyreport on sales and redemptions of series e and h savings bonds. which i have requested be sent to me regularly. and am again deeply concerned by the continuing trend of redemptions exceeding sales. this situation has been reflected by the statistics without pause since july 1958. and with only one interruption since march of that year. during the 24month period ending april 30. 1960. the excess of e- and hbond redemptions over sales has totaled $2.324 million. even the increase in interest rates from 3.26 percent to 3.75 percent. which was put into effect in september 1959 following congressional action to lift the interest ceilthe e- and ilbond picture ing on these bonds. failed to stop this trend. with an excess of redemptions over sales during those 7 months of $565 million. though it did result in a slowing down of the excess of redemption. for some time. i have been advocating that steps be taken by the treasury department to stop further attrition of individual holdings of these antiinflationary bonds. which represent an important portion of the national debt. and signify the interest of every citizen in his countrys fiscal situation. at the present time of world crisis. where our nations ecoy is the frontline of the eastwest struggle. it seems particularly important to take action in this field. i again urge that the treasury avail itself of the authority granted last year by the congress to raise interest rates on e- and hbonds beyond the present 3.75percent level. it should undertake a massive patriotic drive to sell to the public what we  call savings bonds. but which should be renamed "peace bonds"--perhaps featuring a special $25billion issue which would seem to attract millions of new investors in a significant shift of the national debt into these securities. irrespective of congressional action on longterm marketable bond interest rates at this session. this would reflect a shift of the debt into the longer term securities which is sought to be achieved by the administration. the suggestion of my colleague. the senator from delaware . for an immediate rise in the savings bond interest rate to the 4.25percent ceiling. is a most commendable plan for the achievement of this goal. together with my colleague from delaware. with whom i have been working in this field constantly. i urge this course upon the administration. i ask unanimous consent that the report of the treasury department may be printed in the record at this point.
 to enter into foreign tax agreements involving reciprocal tax credits and tax deferrals. it is my hope. that the senate finance committee. recognizing the opportunity of the legislation before it in h.r. 5. will view with favor the amendments in the nature of a substitute which i submit today.
to the bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to encourage private investment abroad and thereby promote american industry and reduce government expenditures for foreign ecoic assistance. were referred to the committee on finance.
i think it is very sad that even this very minimum point in the constitutional amendment. which it was said when the matter was debated would be approved very promptly in a year or two. has  been completely dropped out of the bill so far as the poll tax is concerned. i think it is sad. i shall  contest the matter here. of course. i shall support what is before us. i intend when we next have an opportunity. in the next congress. again to put before the senate the opportunity to support a bill to eliminate the poll tax. it appears that that is the way to do it. because it only takes a majority vote to do it. i should like also to join with the senator from south dakota in the fine things he is saying about my colleague from new york . which are very richly deserved. i agree with the senator from south dakota that the junior senator from new york acted with the greatest wisdom and celerity in seizing the opportunity which was before us and in supporting the excellent measure which the senator had himself authored and in bringing into being something so deserving for the people of the district of columbia. i enthusiastically join the senator from south dakota in extending congratulations to my colleague . who i think in his first 2 years in the senate has. through this particular effort. already performed a very signal service. very easy to identify and fix for the people of the district of columbia. who will be so proud to have this opportunity to exercise the right of suffrage. i k that all of us will throw our weight. in our respective states. behind the ratification of the amendment by the state legislatures. i regret exceedingly that any of the little bit we were going to do about civil rights in the bill has been canceled. i myself pledge. as i k many other senators will also do. my best efforts to have passed a bill to eliminate the poll tax. because i am convinced that this is the way to do it.
. i join with my colleague from new york in support of the amendment. i think he has done very well to propose it. because i think the reason for his position and the position which i espouse with him is best shown by the fact that people who voted on different sides of the issue in respect to continuing the telephone tax can unite behind this amendment. we are talking about the overall national security interest. and the question is. where can this interest be best served. in the state or in the nation. i do  think we should hearken back to the kestnbaum report as the only proof to support this amendment. i think rather the national security test. the national interest test. is the proper one. although the kestnbaum report indicates that this is the kind of tax in which a division between the state and the federal government is a logical recommendation. i say the national security interest for this reason. i voted. for example. to sustain this tax in the hands of the federal government because the amount involved. which is estimated in the committee report for the full year of $450 million. and for 1961 $338 million. can be dispensed with under existing conditions. but i believe at the same time where responsibilities are carried by states which fit into the concept of the national interest or the national security interest. and the states will actually carry out those responsibilities and actually ask their residents to support those responsibilities. then i think the state has an excellent case for participation in the avails of the tax. in other words it should go for the national security interest. but it should go either on the national or on the state level or a division between them. i think my colleague has come to a right division between them. there are hard. fast. and ironclad rules in respect of these tax matters. every one of them must stand on its own two feet. it might have been observed that i voted to eliminate the transportation tax a little while ago. though i voted to sustain the telephone tax. my reason for doing so is that the national security interest requires every effort we can make to fortify the national transportation system. and if this discourages. as it does. a utilization of the national transportation system. i would rather give them this little tax break that amounts to about $150 million for a full year than to vote them more subsidies. if it can be avoided. i make that statement because i think my colleague has tried to cut this pie in an equitable and sensible way. especially in view of the experience of our state. it is a fact that the statute passed by the state legislaturewhich. incidentally. is bill . 5418. 5538. introduced 4678. passed march 27. 1960purported to be a standby law. providing that if the federal telephone tax were repealed. the benefit of the tax would be given on a local election basis. as it were. to school districts which sought to take advantage of it for their particular areas. though that law would  be applicable to the situation which would prevail should this amendment carry. nevertheless it does show the intention of our state to utilize the telephone tax for a matter of the highest national security interest in the field of education. therefore i think that the amendment. though it may  suit the law of new york right . would suit new york. and we would have law to conform to it. it may safely be assumed that ours is one state which would take advantage of it. in our state we have a tradition of standby law. perhaps one of the most able examples of such laws concerned rent control. when the federal government removed rent control. new york was among the very few. if  the only state. that had a standby rent control law. to the great satisfaction of its people. a law which gover dewey had the foresight to induce the legislature to put upon the books. so. in the field we are discussing. gover rockefeller has induced our state legislature to put a statute upon the books which could be very helpful to new york if the majority of congress believe that this tax should go off on the federal level. i do  mean that i would attempt to convince senators. as i see it. to vote to take it off. it depends upon the judgment of senators as to whether they believe it ought to stay on or off in terms of the national establishment. so although i believe in terms of the national establishment the tax ought to remain. i believe also that if a state will carry out a function uniquely within its own power. to wit. education. which makes a decisive contribution to the national security interest. the very purpose for which we retain this tax. then that state ought to be permitted to share in the avails of a tax for that purpose. new york has shown its intention to do so. although its particular law will  actually have that result. i do  think there can be any doubt about the purpose for which my own state would propose to use its own share of such a tax if it were made available. there is single domestic reform. with the exception of equal opportunity for all without regard to race. creed or color. more urgent to the national security interest than a fortification of our educational system. new york. as everybody ks. under gover rockefeller. when he first became gover. imposed upon itself additional taxes. which is pretty unheard of in these days. the imposition of the taxes was an act of political courage. in order to try to do the best new york could do for its educational system. i think it can be said that the people of new york are  first taxing themselves to the hilt before looking to other sources of revenue for this extremely desirable purpose in our national interest. i think my colleague. the senator from new york has done a fair thing in proposing the amendment. i am hoed to join with him in it. based upon the findings of the kestnbaum commission. as to a fair division between the state and federal governments of a tax of this character. and at the same time his proposal carries out the spirit which dictated the findings. i am sure many senators have feelings of concern in their own hearts as to whether this was exactly the right course to follow. but in any case the majority decided that at a time like this. the national security in their view required a continuation of this tax. i believe my colleague has shown us a way which. having asserted that principle. we could etheless make some of these funds available on a fair division basis which i have described for a purpose which is fundamental and essential to the whole national security interest. to wit. the purpose of education. i do  think that our friend and colleague from utah has made a proper answer to the point made by my colleague. the senator from new york by pointing out that in the kestnbaum commissions report the specific purpose of national education and pollution were referred to. i say that because i believe the important thing is the question of what conduces to the very purpose for which we are continuing this tax. i think what is in the minds and hearts of the majority here in continuing the tax is the overriding national security interest. i respectfully submit that the educational purpose which new york contemplates. and which we have every right to believe other states will continue. is very much more directly. as of this writing. related to the national security interest than would be even the specific uses referred to in the kestnbaum report. so i join with my colleague  only in word but in deed. and with great feeling on the subject. in putting forward this amendment. i hope that it may have the affirmative approval of the senate.
i am coming to that. i do  k what will happen in this matter. if the senator from pennsylvania were in a position. under the procedures. to offer a more sharply architected amendment to cover a situation which is as sensitive as this. and as meaningful to so many people. especially so many in my state. for the reasons which the senator from pennsylvania has mentioned. and which i have mentioned. i believe he would find me and many other senators willing to support the amendment. so. without any speculation about what may happen with respect to this particular amendment. i would make a constructive suggestion to the senator from pennsylvania. if it is impossible to do anything about the matter in the tax bill  under consideration. the senator ks and i k that aher tax bill will be considered next year. because these very taxes need to be renewed. if i were the senator from pennsylvania. i would work on this subject from the point of view of a finely chiseled amendment. i would start on it early egh so that a public understanding of what his proposal will do and what it will  do. and what it will allow and what it will  allow. will have been built up and discussed in advance. one reason why we serve in the senate for 6 years. and one of the great advantages of such service. is that we can start something and finish it before aher election. which is very hard to do in the other body. if the senator would do what i suggest. the senator would then be able to complete what i consider to be a real service which he started. in an effort really to bring it into specific compass. so that the businessman would k expressly and exactly what were the ground rules. and that they did accommodate themselves to the actual conditions under which they labored. aher reason for my suggestion is that this is the second year the senator from pennsylvania has offered such an amendment.
 i voted. in connection with this very bill. for example. for the telephonetax amendment. withstanding the desire of the gover of new york to have that revenue spent for education. and i will vote for measures to raise additional revenue in order to provide for the increased pay we have voted for the employees of the government. so i am just as committed to voting for the necessary taxes as i am to voting for the things the people of the country want. even though they cost money. i think that attitude classifies me as one who believes in fiscal responsibility. and i k the senator from pennsylvania feels the same way. but the problem which confronted me in this instance was essentially a lawyers problem. in dealing with the situation of persons and businesses with travel and entertainment expenses. let me state that i am  opposing the senator from pennsylvania. we are  arguing a case in court. i. myself. will undertakeand the senator from pennsylvania ks that this is  an idle statement on my partto examine the amendment very carefully and to ascertain whether i can be of any help to the senator from pennsylvania. instead of asking him to do that. i will try to do it. because on this issue i want to be with him. rather than against him.
 has vetoed are examined. it will be seen that in percentages it gets so close to what the bill provides that. king as i do the individual hardships involvedand i have lived with it for yearsit does  make any sense to turn this bill down and start all over again. everyone agrees that the two and a half percent cost of living increase should be continued. and there seems to be general agreement. even from the strongest opponents. that there ought to be something added to thatlet us say aher two and a half percent. many. including the senator from kansas . have talked about the fact that the increase should be three and a half percent. the senator from kansas himself proposed that there be a 6percent increase. when the final one and a half percent or two and a half percent differenceconsidering the 71/2 percent in this billis precipitated down to the individual salary. and realizing that if the veto is sustained we must start from scratch. with the real possibility that hing may happen. and considering the present state of the congressional session and the fact that we shall return in august in a highly political atmosphere in congress. i think the decision must be made looking at the measure  from the astral regions down. but from the ground up. i believe the measure before us  is reasonable and proper. considering the situation. and in the round that reasonableness is pretty much agreed to. in my opinion. as indicated even by the concessions of those who oppose the measure. hence. i shall vote to override the veto.
to say that social security is pay as you go is something of a euphemism. the term falls outside the context of what we usually mean when we say "pay as you go." because the taxes. for example. are direct taxes. i pointed that out before. they come from those who are  the recipients of the benefit. in the main. they come from those who may ultimately receive the benefit. in addition. i think the entire social security establishmentand the senator from new mexico is a far greater authority on this subject than am ihas complex problems in it as to financial viability. return on investment. and different types of trust funds. it seems to me that pure pay as you go. as we define the term. to mean when we work for the benefit. or we feel a certain thing ought to be pay as you go. means pay as you go out of general revenue appropriations. i am  challenging the right of the senator from new mexico and his colleagues to claim that they have a form of pay as you go. but i certainly do  feel that it is fair to say that theirs is a payasyougo plan and mine is .
. i have heard with great interest the most enlightening presentation by my friend the senator from louisiana. i did  interrupt his remarks. because i thought the debate was very heavily concentrated upon the committee bill versus the anderson amendment. and earlier in the day i had spent a considerable amount of time debating my own substitute for the anderson amendment and also answering many questions by senators who feel strongly about the anderson amendment. interestingly egh. many of those questions were of the same general character. i hope that. overnight. senators will read with special care the remarks of the senator from louisiana about the matter of the strange change which has taken placewith republican senators who support my amendment advocating the idea of a general revenue plan. and with democratic senators. who generally wish to equalize these burdens by charging them to the whole of the taxpaying capability of the country. concentrating on the part of the taxpaying capabilityi think the senator made that point very clearwhich is much more in the nature of a salestax approach than we would mally expect to have advocated by senators on that side. i very much appreciate the presentation made by the senator from louisiana and the details he has submitted on that point. and his presentation will be helpful to all of us. regardless of how we vote on these amendments.
. i submit an amendment. intended to be proposed by me. to the bill to amend certain provisions of the internal revenue code of 1954 relating to possessions of the united states. and for other purposes. and ask that it be printed. under the rule. i ask unanimous consent that a brief explanation of the amendment. which is contained in a letter addressed to me by the assistant to the secretary of the treasury. be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
. i wish to commend very highly the senator from washington for taking the leadership in this matter. i merely wish to emphasize that the subject involves  less than a billion dollars a year. which is the deficit we suffer as represented by the difference between what our travelers spend abroad and what foreign travelers spend in the united states. we are the only nation of any consequence in the world which makes effort to attract tourism. that is what the senator from washington desires to do.
. i send to the desk. for appropriate reference. a bill which i introduce on behalf of myself and my colleague. the junior senator from new york and the senator from massachusetts . which is designed to broaden for the commuter railroads the benefit of tax relief measures granted to them by state and local governments. to enable them to operate. i ask unanimous consent that an explanatory statement on the bill be printed in the record at this point.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to provide that taxes on admissions shall  apply to admissions to any live dramatic program. including musical performances. this is a bill which is sponsored in the other body by my colleague. representative lindsay of new york.
 who is a member of our party. and yet with a role to fill which in the eyes of the country must be extremely important. i make these points with respect to the education bill. which is an excellent case in point. to demonstrate two ways in which we can proceed: first. there is a basis in precedent in our own party for enlightened views upon these modern subjects. certainly senator taft is a most respectable and. indeed. quite a proper source upon which to draw in that regard. second. i wish to demonstrate my deep conviction that we can serve the country and serve our party best by utilizing the doctrine of feasible alternatives. of which this is one. "feasible alternatives" does  mean that all we must do is to react to what the administration proposes. so that if it proposes a bill on federal aid to education. we have an alternative to that bill. it also means that we must have enterprise and initiative. in that connection. other members of the senate have introduced measures. such as the resolution that was submitted earlier today with reference to a united nations police force. which embodied ideas that did  come from the other side. but which arose on this side of the aisle. i have myself introduced measures of different types. such as the one to set up labormanagement productivity councils. i point that out to emphasize the fact that the idea of a feasible alternative. in which i thoroughly believe. means. whether we are talking about productivity or lag in education. or some other subject. and  merely reacting to a program that is placed before us by an administration proposal. a proposal which will come from the republican side to meet a particular national need or a particular international situation. generally. this is the approach which i believe can be of the most effective use to our people. in this connection. too. we should  forego the opposition. the dissection. the criticism. the detailed challenge of how we are to make something work. or where we are going to get the money. or with respect to presenting what is generally associated with the conservative position. this bears out my deep conviction that within my party there is room for all elements. liberal and conservative. as well as those who emphasize opposition. and also for those who. like myself. emphasize the doctrine of feasible alternative. it should be made clear. as i have tried to make clear in my remarks. that there is this composite of opinion. and that. therefore. there should be a composite of proposed action. such as i have described.
 of the united states has done an excellent thing in setting up an advisory committee on labormanagement policy. but i think that action should  be implemented by law. so as to get money to bring the activity down to plant and local levels. in order that we may have grassroots participation. that is the purpose of my bill. it would establish an operating agency and create functioning agencies throughout the country to stimulate productivity on the local level. where such productivity can do the most good. this is new idea. it is hing which has suddenly been invented. during the war we had 5.000 precisely such councils functioning on the local level. they had much to do with the reduction of absenteeism. dealing with efficiency. eliminating featherbedding. and dealing with problems of automation. they did
ial appointmentswarnings that we should  permit the "honeymoon" period of the new administration to encourage improvidence. cooperation and prompt action to meet the recession emergencyyes. the acceptance of the emergency tag on legislation where it does  belong the constructive opposition has a duty to oppose when opposition is needed. to suggest new initiatives or feasible alternatives that can do the job better. and to support what deserves to be supported. even when the administration may  have that support within its own party. the real issues are first the effort to put the emergency tag on legislation on which it does  belong. and second. the prospect that the main reliance for dealing with the recession will be on government action rather than on incentives to the private ecoic system and leadership by governmentthe kind of leadership advocated by federal reserve chairman william mcchesney martin and the kind of governmentbusiness cooperation contemplated by secretary of the treasury dillon in their recent testimony before the joint ecoic committee. i should like to state to the senator from illis . who is in the chamber. that this is commonly considered the "think committee" of congress. and i should like to state to him that under his chairmanship. as it has developed in the past 2 years. the committee fully deserves that appellation. i do  believe that a senator can enjoy any greater pleasure in this body than to have the privilege of sitting with him and his associates on that committee.
 kennedy has alleged that we must find 25.000 new jobs a week. i respectfully submit that if we are to find 25.000 new jobs a week in order to employ the mal accretions to the work force in the united states. we shall have to find at least 2.500 of those jobs within the state of new york itself. because we have 10 percent of the employables of the united states. in order to employ that number. we must go out and dig. i might say. too. because i think it is important to put this problem in focus. that during the eisenhower administration. which is being somewhat ecoically maligned . about 18.000 new jobs a week were found. one understands better than iand many senators on this side of the aisle feel exactly the same waythat we have a problem of unemployment. even so. the fact is that we have the highest employment in history. and we must think  only of the 61/2 percent or 7 percent who may be unemployed and who we are seeking to help in every way humanly possible. but also we must think about and plan for opportunities for the 93 percent plus who are employed. in my state they number approximately 6 million people. so i am interested in the bill. which is  especially for the benefit of my state. but will benefit other states. i believe it is very true that with the great interest we have. if the country is in better shape. we are in better shape. but at the same time. we do  want to load the deck against mal competition between the states. which will continue after the bill becomes law as it has operated in the past. in mal competition there are ground rules. mally a state or locality is very well able by its own devicesand many have done soto work out a solution. the junior senator from new york and i have an outstanding example in utica. n.y.. which suffered a devastating blow when the textile industry moved out of that community overnight and cut employment to ribbons. and which by setting up a development agency of its own. with the use of many people and private credit. restored itself to a very high degree of effectiveness in industrial terms. we are coming to the rescue of particular communities which apparently are unable to do so because of the inadequacy of their resources. however. it seems to me we do  want to come to their rescue to such an extent that they then will be in a better position to compete with their neighbors than they would have a right to be if they were restored to their mal competitive status. the mal pattern of development in any american community. in terms of the bill. has been for the community. with its own resources and with private resources. to offer people tax accommodations. retrained help through vocational training in the schools or in analogous ways. and a good climate in terms of taxation. perhaps they might be offered some arrangements with respect to taxation on real estate. and buildings which might have been either vacated by other industries as a result of techogical unemployment. or which the community might undertake to construct. but it has been most unusual. and indeed considered to be unfair competition among the respective states. to try to give to an industry. in order to attract it into a particular area. a plant fully equipped. etheless. that is exactly what the bill contemplates. therefore. the first point is that we would be loading against the industrial states a competitive situation which had previously existed in terms of trying to get new business. which situation exists . and which will exist tomorrow. even when the bill is passed. by giving an advantage beyond restoring the community to the mal ability to compete. by giving to the redevelopment areas an advantage beyond what is contemplated by the bill. if we persist in including the item respecting machinery and equipment. i think it is most unfair to the industrial states. which will be financing this whole operation very heavily. because they are the principal tax producers in the country. i say this as a friend of the bill and as one who is interested in seeing the bill pass. the provision to which i object represents a distortion of the purpose of the bill. and therefore should be corrected for the reasons i have mentioned. it is very well knand i do  believe any authority need be cited for itthat the mal pattern of attracting business by american industry does  include the furnishing to a particular industry or a small business with machinery and equipment. such a proposal has been protested against many times as representing unfair competition. and as being particularly unfair to many of the states. for example. many states send representatives to other states. they send them to my stateand this is particularly true of southern states. who do a great deal of thisto attract business to their states. however. it is most unusual for an inducement to be held out in terms of machinery and equipment.
that is  so. because the antipirating provisions of the bill are quite tight. i call the senators attention to the tests. such a move must  reduce employment in other areas of the united states. it must  result in substantial detriment to the area of original location. it may  transfer jobs from one community to aher. there has been a very considerable tightening of the antipirating and antiraiding provisions. the difficulty is that the antiraiding provisions deal with established business or with new branches of the established business. i am trying to deal with the mal competition among the states for new business. that is the objective toward which the machinery and equipment amendment is directed.
there are two answers to the question. one is the antipirating provision is even better than the senator has indicated. because it deals  only with a substantial detrimentwhich is what the senator from ohio is speaking ofbut deals with merely transferring jobs from one community to aher. so we assume. if there was a transfer of jobs there would be a substantial detriment. i shall pursue this matter in a discussion with the senator handling the bill. i wish to make it very clear for the record that the antipirating provision includes  only the case of substantial detriment but a loss of jobs as the senator has pointed out. the second answer is the obvious one. which affects us in everything we donamely. the greatest good for the greatest number. some states are under par. whether it be in natural resources. educational facilities. or ecoic development. most of us want to help them. but  at the cost of putting them in a better position than we are in an opportunity to compete for new business and jobs. which the country urgently needs. it is for that purpose that i offer the amendment. i wish to state to the miity leader that i have concluded the presentation of my case for the amendment. with the most gracious aid of my colleagues. i wish to emphasize the point made by my colleague from new york that the money provided under the bill is inadequate. so why load it down with aher requirement that loans be made for machinery and equipment. instead of spreading it as far as that can go. even though it is a pilot plan. i should like to ask the miity leader whether any time is to be taken in opposition to the amendment. or whether we are ready to vote.
i suggested to my colleague the inclusion of the word "unit." because we are dealing with an entity. that does  mean it is a major part of the entire installation. but it means that in and of itself it is a major unit which is a part of the installation. that language certainly would cover the installation at rome. n.y.. and would be fair. because some of the installations are so extensive that. as has properly been stated. if 7.000 jobs were dropped out at the installation at romebecause of the dropping of a unit which is a major one in that connectionit might  be a major part of the installation. taken as a whole. so the legislative history should show that by using the word "unit." we mean a functional organization of a major character.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the red creek valley grange of cooperstown. n.y.. protesting against any further increase in federal automotive excise taxes. including the federal tax on motor fuels.
. on january 30. 1961. i introduced s. 658. to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 so as to permit railroad corporations to take full advantage of tax relief measures enacted or granted by the states and their political subdivisions. such relief has been granted by a number of states. the latest of which is the action by the state of connecticut to assist the continued operations of the new haven railroad and of the state of new york on tax remission and station maintenance. the senator from connecticut has for a long time been deeply concerned with the problems faced by our commuter railroads. and has asked to join as a sponsor of this legislation. which relates so closely to the recent action by his state. i therefore ask unanimous consent that the senator from connecticut may be joined as a cosponsor of s. 658. and that his name may appear on the next printing of the bill.
as sponsor of s. 1181. the national productivity council act of 1961. my attention was particularly engaged by the need for just this kind of legislation brought out by the secretarys analysis. he writes that "master plan can be drawn for lifting the skills of a work force as varied and diverse as ours. the situation in each community. and within each industry. requires its own devices and tools. what each does have in common is the need for maximum cooperation among important segments of the communityeducation. business. and labor. to name three." furthermore. there must be "an adequate lead time between the decision to automate and the actual changeover." as well as. "thorough consultation between labor and management concerning employee displacement and job changes." these recommendations go right to the heart of s. 1181 which would stimulate the creation of labormanagementpublic councils at local. industrywide. and regional levels. and provide for the broad use of educational facilities in retraining programs as well as in the study of industrial relations. although president kennedys advisory committee on labormanagement policy is undoubtedly a useful first step in considering the large. national issues involved in labormanagement relations. it can solve the grassroots problems. individual to each community and industry. which the secretary so ably points out. i believe that the national productivity council act of 1961 which i would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues for their most earnest consideration does present the framework within which these problems can be solved effectively. in view of the increasing pressures on the united states ecoy. resulting from accelerated automation and growing competition in both domestic and foreign marketsin short. because the united states must lead.  be overwhelmed by. the revolution of the world ecoyi hope for early consideration by the congress of s. 1181.
. the amendment which i have prepared would have for its purpose assisting states to strengthen and improve state and local programs for the control of juvenile delinquency. and would authorize the appropriation for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1962. the sum of $2 million. and for each of the following fiscal years such sums.  to exceed $5 million annually. as congress may determine. i wish to emphasize a point on the part of all of us who live in big cities. and this is true of my colleague from pennsylvania. and i hope that he will  misunderstand what i say. because he has done so much in this field. and i am  trying in any way to derogate that accomplishment. i point out that all of us who live in big cities are just  doing egh. when we consider our parks. whether it be a big park in chicago or philadelphia or our central park in new york. when people do  dare go into a park at night. or are afraid to go down a dark street at night because of the danger of being assaulted by young hoodlums. it is a fact that when i was attorney general of the state of new york our state commission on juvenile delinquency issued a very fine report on the subject. it is a fairly long report. and i ask unanimous consent that it may be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. as a member of the joint ecoic committee. i have for some time been deeply interested and concerned with the role of savings bonds in the debt structure of the federal government. and the excess of redemptions over sales which has been taking place since 1956. it is gratifying to e the recent reversal of this trend and the growth of the u.s. savings bond program. it is a happy circumstance that these dollar gains coincide with the observance of the 20th anniversary of the savings bond program. which occurs on may 1 of this year. during the first 3 months of this year total investment in series e and h bondsthe only savings bonds  offeredincreased by nearly $400 million. which is the largest gain for any 3month period in the past 5 years. the cash value of outstanding bonds as of march 31. 1961. stood at an alltime record high of $43.536 million. it is especially good to see cash sales outrunning gross redemptions. as they have been doing for the past 3 months. redemptions during this quarter were down 15.7 percent from last year. and were in fact lower than for any corresponding quarter since 1956. since the very beginning. in 1941. the bond program has been largely the work of volunteers in every field of activity. bankers. businessmen. labor unions. community groups. womens organizations. the entertainment industry. and other groups have been closely associated with the programs success. through the advertising council. the advertising industry has contributed more than $1 billion in free space and time. and current contributions are running at a rate of $50 million annually. this work of the savings bond volunteers has encouraged millions of americans to save for important future goals. it has helped to make our country stronger ecoically. it is a fine example of patriotic participation in an important national program. i hope that everything possible will be done to maintain this new trend. which i believe to be most helpful to the american ecoy and the fiscal situation of the nation. i ask unanimous consent that there may be printed in the record at this point statements by the savings bond division of the treasury department and tables setting out the trends in sales and redemptions of e and h bonds.
in order to put a proper period to our discussion. i should like to state that in what i said to the senator i was speaking only personally about two men i k very well. one the distinguished gover of my state. and the other a distinguished business leader. and on the substantive question i reserve judgment. i have listened to the remarks with great interest. and will read with great interest the discourse which has taken place. certainly. whatever is considered to be incentive compensationand i think americans are accustomed to the idea that people with special abilities must be well paidmust be measured against the fair share of the tax burden. i assure the senator from tennessee i will examine the question with an open mind. i think the senator ks i will  be found lacking in making kn my own instincts for social justice. which i think the senator has found to be true of me.
under the practicalities of the situation. that may be all we can do. in view of the urgency for getting this done. we will have to do it that way at this time. i also hope this legislation will help our government throw itself behind the general process of bringing down the interest rate structure in the latinamerican countries.
madam president. i merely wished to call to the attention of the senate the fact that senator taft. who was a great friend of federal aid to education. met the same problem we are confronting. the senator from oregon introduced his views. which senator taft uttered in 1949. at page 8218 of the record. senator taft said: it is based on the supposition that in some way a state has some property right to the taxes collected from sources within its boundaries. if. for one moment. we admit such a principle. the entire federal financial system will crash. because a state has such interest. the place where tax moneys are collected has relationship even to whether people living in that state pay the taxes. that is the argument that has been so well made by the senator from texas. i believe we are all very sympathetic to the senator from wisconsin in his fundamental thrust of what he proposes to accomplish. i hope very much. withstanding our differences on his amendment. we will all join together in seeing to it that our purposes are kept clear at every phase. that we do want independence by the school district. however. we are  getting it by the proposed amendment. i differ with the senator. in my opinion we invite other problems that we do  have to invite. because the appropriation process must be met etheless.
i would say in this case it is so peripheral to the main point that i would feel the house could  feel it would be amiss. i have served in the house. as the senator ks. and i k how sensitive it is on this question. if the main thrust were the tax exemption. i would agree. but it is only peripheral to the main point. the idea of tax exemption on housing bonds has been very deeply imbedded in our housing legislation through public housing. and i do  see how the house could take it to be amiss if we offered it the opportunity to embrace the same principle in respect of moderate income housing. where the main thrust was  tax exemption. however. that is one of the main peripheral benefits. the main idea is  to get tax exemption for the bonds. but the main purpose is different. it happens that the tax exemption helps. but the tax exemption is only incidental to the fact that the bonds would be issued by a government corporation. it therefore would be tax exempt under state law. too. since a state could  tax a governmental instrumentality. therefore. in view of the fact that the main thrust of the proposal is  tax exemption per se. i would say the house should  take offense. i may point out that there are some 15 examples of bonds issued by various types of government corporations which also. by virute of their origin. have been. for practical purposes. tax exempt. i am confident. and we will check the matter over the weekend. that many of these proposals did  originate in the house. we shall check that point to make sure. i have made the best answer i can make to the senators view. which i deeply respect.
in the state of new york all of these projects. i believe. without exception. have been privately sponsored. and in practically all cases they have been able to work out deals with municipalities for tax abatement. because the municipality gets a big advantage in the improvement of its slum and blighted property. in most cases it has fundamentally been a privately sponsored proposition. largely in the profit field. however. it is an entirely viable program for private individuals who are willing to take a limited rate of profit. they have the advantage. however. at the end of 20 years. of being able to refinance the project and have it as a completely private project. most of the projects have been sponsored by trade unions or groups of people who get back the property as a cooperative. and then in turn there is a further devolution down to the individual occupant. in his ownership of individual property. a cooperative apartment.

i shall do my best. as briefly as i can. in the first place. the problem is  of the magnitude that it has been advertised to be. the figures i have. indicate that the very foreign subsidiaries to which the senator has referred. bring into the united states some $200odd million worth of goods a year. while there are exported to their own plants. for their own purposes. about eight times as much. about $1.6 billion. one way we can solve the trade expansion problem is by a greater guarantee of export credits by the exportimport bank. as to which some efforts are  being made. the exportimport bank has annced that it intends to liberalize and expand its operations. it has  actually been done yet. but there are conferences being held about it. exporters would be encouraged to sell in areas where the credit is   as good as it is in commercialized areas. the suggestion is made that such areas be given longterm credit. we must remember that the japanese. the english. and other countries give 5and 10year terms on credit guarantees. while we are caught flatfooted in making the same kind of credit guarantee available. the senator is a member of the foreign relations committee of the senate. i point out that our government is suffering seriously from an absence of business management. business management can be gotten out of the government. i believe the committee should direct its attention toward some means of introducing business management. through the private ecoic system. into the management of the foreign aid program. in the various countries in which the program operates. i think. through our own foreign aid program. we can absorb some of the imports from which we are  suffering. if we did any of these things to an appreciable extent. we would be suffering from a shortage of imports. the leverage in that field is so great. finally. the countries of europe right  are quite prosperous. and they are  beginning to take the imports that they should take. i say. let us  cut off our e to spite our face. and curtail our own trade position by imposing quotas and high tariffs. export markets are available. and they should be gone after. for example. in one commodity. coffee. there is the possibility of increasing the exports of brazil and the few other countries in latin america that sell coffee by up to $100 million annually if only germany and a few other countries would reduce what are called sumptuary taxes. which are the remains of the past. when coffee was considered a luxmy. and which taxes remain in the law because the governments have come to depend on certain amounts of revenue as a result of sumptuary taxes. and those countries do  want to remove those taxes unless we get after them very hard. those are a number of ways in which the situation can be alleviated.
i wish to address the senate with respect to aher subject. but before i do so. i hope i will be forgiven if i may compliment the senator from minnesota . the senator from oklahoma . the senator from alabama . and the two senators from alaska for their statements on the bill. i happen to have the ho of being one of that company that sponsored the bill to create the national heart institute in the other body when i was a new representative. i will agree with the senator from minnesota that i am extremely proud of that. i have often said. "of all the things i did in congress. i think this measure gave me the most gratification." perhaps other things i might have done were more useful to the nation. but the action gave me the greatest pleasure. i should like to ask the distinguished chairman of the committee. the senator from alabama . a question for the benefit of those of us who have  sat in on the hearings and have  had the benefit of the kledge and the detailed information which the chairman has. and who have heard conflicting views. on the one hand. we have heard views with respect to the budget. i agree with the principle that we are either a congress or we are . if we were to accept the budget request. whether from the republican administration or the democratic administration. we would be rubberstamps. i am  persuaded by such argument at all. but taking the budget figure and the figure of the citizens committee. could we have a statement from the chairman which would give us the criterion of judgment. what was the formula that the committee used in fixing the figure. how did the committee arrive at such and such a figure of increase. when there are very large increases added to the requests. rather than taking the budget figures or the citizens committees figures. i would like to k if there was any formula which was used. or perhaps one or two examples of applicability in respect to the fields in question. the information would be helpful to me.
. we are talking about an emous market involving 300 million people. so i say to my friends who are talking about quotas and about tariffs. to remember what we are up against in this situation. in connection with this emous market. probably the greatest the world has ever seen. with a gross national product equal to our own. this is the first time that we have seen this happen. this newly expanded european common market will have a gross national product of $500 billion. the russians have a gross national product of about $220 billion. and the european countries themselves  have a gross national product of $160 billion.  we are going to be talking about an equal power with our own. and we had better prepare to meet it. we must do so  by drawing back into fortress america in an ecoic sense. but by being ready to trade and to do business. we can do that if we will renew the reciprocal trade agreements act. this is a momentous and historic development. at the very time when the russians have told us that they expect to beat us ecoically. after khrushchev has told us that they expect to bury us. and at a time. also. when the whole communist world is trying to reconstitute itself with a new party program. as published in todays newspapers and published in text in the new york times. this is certainly time for us to be blind to the ecoic realities of the world. therefore. i make these two points: first. let us show the world that we sympathize with and like the idea of britain joining the expanded common market community and. second. let us begin to cooperate to deal with this community on terms of equality. at the same time. let us legislate to meet the complaints of businesses and industries and workers who are adversely affected by concentrated imports. in short. let us understand the ecoic facts of life. if we do that. this can be the greatest victory our world has had in recent time.
. i have just received from the treasury department the june 1961 report on sales and redemptions of series e and h savings bonds. these reports are sent to me regularly. on previous occasions i have indicated my deep concern over the disturbing trend whereby redemptions exceed sales of these bonds. though there has been some improvement in this situation following an increase in the interest rates from 3.26 percent to 3.75 percent. redemptions have continued to surpass sales. during the 24month period ending june 30. 1961. the excess of e- and hbond redemption over sales totaled $1.358 million. further evidence of this aggravating gap is reflected by the statistics for fiscal 1961. redemptions once again outdistanced sales. there is some indication that this trend is receding and during the last 6 months sales achieved a slight edge. percentage comparisons show that sales of e- and hbonds were up 9 percent and redemptions were down 10 percent from june 1960. there has also been a decrease in the total excess of redemption values. nevertheless. at best. this reversal is in its infant stages and. if it is to be nurtured. action must be taken. both in april and may of 1961 redemptions again surpassed sales. for some time i have been advocating that the treasury department take measures to prevent any further attrition of individual holdings which represent an important portion of our national debt and which demonstrate the interest of every american in his countrys fiscal situation. in 1959 the congress authorized the treasury department to raise interest the e- and ibond picture rates on e- and hbonds. i again urge that they be raised beyond the present 3.75 percent level to make investment in these securities more attractive. furthermore. the treasury should undertake a massive. patriotic drive to. sell more of these bonds to the public. a special $25 billion issue of peace bonds should be offered which would attract millions of new investors and remove some of the inflationary dangers inherent in our national debt. in order to emphasize the importance of the sale of these securities. what we  call savings bonds should be renamed peace bonds. if these measures are taken i believe that we will be able to effect a shift of the national debt into longer term securities. at the present time of world crisis. when our nation is in the front line of the cold war struggle and when our ecoy is being tested by the strain of international competition. i believe it is necessary to make maximum utilization of all of our resources while insuring our fiscal integrity. if these measures are adopted we shall be better able to meet the challenge of world leadership. i ask unanimous consent that the report of the treasury department may be printed in the record.
first. let me say that all of us owe a real debt of gratitude to the senator from massachusetts [mr. saltonstallj. the senator from new york . the senator from illis . the senator from arkansas . and all other senators who have participated in the effort to whip this provision into shape. it is difficult to say whose name the amendment will finally bear. but i think all senators concerned are to be congratulated for their initiative and their effort. because in my opinion this has been the weak point of the whole matter. and i think the vote taken the other evening confirmed it. so i am very proud that so substantial a number of senators on our side has shown their good faith in advancing this proposal. after they said this would happen. and the senator from massachusetts has been a leader in this effort. second. i am glad to hear the senator from arkansas  confirm what has been a debatable point. namely. that the concurrent resolution technique. although it has been in the law for 13 years and has  been used. is etheless usable. and that when we reach a point where it seems that longterm borrowing authority will be grantedas i feel is the casethe concurrent resolution technique is the ultimate sanction. it is very important. and i am very glad to see that the senators lawyer and my own lawyer have come to this conclusion. my brief has been placed in the record. and it bears out that point.  we come to the question of which of these various proposals should be adopted. i submit to the senator from massachusetts that the dirksen substitute wraps all these things up the best. and i should like to point out the reasons why that is so. first. it avoids a vote in the senate and a vote in the house of representativesin other words. the sort of vote which would occur if this were a reorganization proposal. i think that situation lends itself to a great deal of logrolling and a great deal of specialinterest lobbying. and i think it is a rather dangerous thing.
i should like to ask the senator a question. to pinpoint the present argument. would the senator agree it is a fact that a provision in a budget which would go to the appropriations committee. which would call for a commitment over more than 1 year. could be deleted by the appropriations committee at that stage.
i can agree with that statement. my amendment is attached to the hickenlooper amendment. if the hickenlooper amendment were to carry with my amendment. we would have lost one step which we  have. having defeated the byrd amendment. that is the step the senator has named. however. with the applicability of the tight control under revised section 104. which the senator has affixed in his own amendment. i do  see that the president could borrow these funds. that is. borrow them in fiscal year 2 as contrasted with authority which he may have had to borrow them in fiscal year 1. or perform a contract or commitment which he had. in view of the mandate of legislative construction which says that one must read the whole act together. i can see how the president could make a commitment or contract except subject to this section of the law. which means subject to annual review by congress. we do get into national ho. national credit. and national credibility. which is involved. i am doing something. i am letting him sign a piece of paper to do something. although it is subject to this section of the bill. that gives us something. and it is a great deal more than the inability to do it. i am  disguising my purpose.
as i understand the situation. the appropriation for the civil rights commission will carry it only until ember of this year. would it be the senators intention. should he be successful. to seek to increase that appropriation. so the additional life of the commission might be cared for. in terms of the regular appropriations. to the end of the fiscal year.
madam president. let me say this is  a matter of being grateful to any person or to any administration. this is a matter which is of the highest order of importance to our country. let me say. too. that we are likely to stand here and debate these things very coolly. and there are many thingswhether it be the payment of taxes or the levying of taxes or the making of appropriations or authorizationswhich can be considered fairly dispassionately. one either favors more taxes or more appropriations. or he does . or one either favors certain authorizations. or he does . but let us understand that here we are talking about rather serious matters which have erupted into riots. and people have been hurt. and there has been anarchy in whole communities. and federal troops have had to be called in to restore order. so we are talking about rather inflammable material. therefore. when i say what i do about the administration. it is  with disrespect. but it is with deepest appreciation of the progress which has been made in connection with the litigation phase by the department of justice. but. somehow or other. for reasons best kn to the administration. congress has  been approached at all in regard to the passage of even what i consider to be necessary laws in this highly inflammable and highly dangerous situation. and. as one senator. i shall take the opportunity which is presented to meand this is that opportunity. and in my opinion there will be other at this sessionto try to do something substantive about it. madam president
i shall be glad to. the point of this amendment is to bring down to the plant. community. regional. or industry levels the concepts of the bill itself to enhance the productivity of the united states. it would obtain in respect of the work of labormanagementpublic committees on this local level. which could deal  only with the problems of retraining. and be extremely helpful in advising. but could also deal with problems raised by automation. which so many people feel results in the displacement of labor. and the need for reorienting labor. they may deal with other deficiencies in terms of capability of the employee. so as to bring about improvement in efficiency. they may deal with transportation problems to and from plants. which often have a great deal to do with productivity. they may deal with problems of absenteeism. i point out that this is an opportunity to duplicate a remarkable experience which we had in world war ii. when we had 5.000 committees exactly like those described in this amendment. and which functioned in precisely the same way. in an effort. on the local level. on a volunteer basis. through cooperation with labormanagement and public committees. to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the american productive effort. the bill of the senator from pennsylvania gives us an opportunity for the establishment of a national advisory committee as a framework within which we can try to duplicate some of this very constructive experience. obviously.  all of the 5.000 committees were successful. the best information we have been able to getand we have researched the matter very thoroughlyindicates that at least onethird. or about 1.500 were really effective in terms of what they were able to accomplish. the reason for including subsection (c) in my amendment is that i am confident these committees on the local level can be selfsustaining in terms of their own great interest. in trade unions. municipalities. and companies in industry. and have such a local setup to which they can look for help in these very critical fields with which the bill of the senator from pennsylvania is concerned. so the amendment can only help. it is  complicated. it is  expensive. it is under the jurisdiction of the advisory committee which is already provided by the bill. i have consulted with my distinguished colleague from pennsylvania. and with other colleagues.  so much for the purpose of winning them over to the amendment as to sound out its effectiveness and the likeliness of its being worthwhile. i am very gratified to report the amendment has received well nigh universal approbation.
when i was a member of the committee on the district of columbia. i espoused this amendment. i am glad the senator from oregon has offered it. it is the general practice in communities which impose a sales tax to exempt food because a tax on food is regressive. i sincerely hope the chairman of the committee may see fit to accept the amendment and take it to conference. as he has done with respect to a number of other amendments which. with his usual distinction and force. the senator from oregon has offered.
madam president. i support the bill. i will . of course. repeat the words already stated so very well by the distinguished chairman of the committee on foreign relations. the need for greatly increased private capital investment in enterprises in developing areas is urgent. the debtequity ratio in the financing of private enterprise in the less developed areas is much too high for sound ecoic growth. while. in the united states. manufacturing enterprises have approximately $2 of equity investment to each dollar of debt. the ratio in even the most stable manufacturing enterprises located in the less developed areas is about $1 of equity to $1 of debt. the fixed and often high interest rates that have to be paid on this large proportion of debt severely hamper the growth of these enterprises. especially during their formative years when large reinvestments should be plowed back into the business. equity investment by ifc can help to improve this situation and will serve to encourage private enterprise efforts in the developing nations. madam president. i believe that these results are very much in line with the foreign policy objectives of the united states and with our desire to strengthen freedom of choice and initiative in the emerging free world nations. i therefore favor this bill. and hope it will pass.
first. i express appreciation to my colleague. the distinguished senator from new york . for carrying the ball on this amendment. so many problems arise in such a great state that if we did  divide the work and do our homework. we would be sunk in this chamber. so it is gratifying to me that my colleague from new york has made a special study of the subject. there is one thing which i believe has  been pointed out with respect to the federal government. i agree with the senator from mississippi when he says the federal government wishes to do something  in a situation which it has  done before. the federal government wishes to do justice. i am sure the senator will agree with that statement. therefore. it is  a matter of looking a gift horse in the mouth. we are dealing with our own government and our own taxpayers. with a very large part of the money which would be used coming from our own state of new york. it is estimated that more than 19 percent of all federal tax money comes from the state of new york. without going into the fact that tax money comes also from the other states. of course it does. i think that is a point which must be made. and the senator from mississippi certainly has made it eloquently. however. i think we are entitled to plead for justice. even though the federal government is. as it were. "bountiful." i believe the point which needs to be made is made in a letter from the steering committee of the new york congressional delegation. which i shall place in the record. it lends some equity to our position. the soundness of the fund will depend on congress. congress will make it good. i have heard the argument made many times that the fund is actuarily sound. based on the contributions from hardmoney people like the senator from nebraska . who has been one of the first to argue that point. however. in the state of new york. just as in the other socalled high payment states. the funds are actuarily sound. when i was the attorney general of the state of new york. one of the members of my staff was an outstanding expert on retirement systems. he said the best thing i could do was to fund my federal retirement. which was far greater in terms of service than state retirement. i was in the state government for only 2 years. but i have been a federal official for 14 years. he advised me to take the state system. under the federal system. congress may make good the commitment. because there is  egh money in the fund to make it good. so from that point of view there is equity. in that the state employees affected do  have anything to look to but the fund. fortunately. our state is trying to keep its fund actuarily sound. whereas under the federal system the argument we accept as implicit is that the fund is dependent. to a substantial extentthe promise of retirement being kepton the fact that congress will back up the fund.
. here is an extraordinary life. kn to all americans. of a fine american woman. who did  paint until she was over 80. and who has  been acclaimed as one of the most distinguished artists in our country and the world. i think we would want to signalize this extraordinary life. which has  encompassed more than a century. with its tremendous productivity and artistry and its inspiration to everyone who is over 21.
i thank the senator from florida. i wish to address my remarks to the senator from new jersey . who is particularly concerned with the open space land grants. i ask him whether in his view. as an ardent advocate of this program. $35 million. which is what the house has allowed. instead of the authorization of $50 million. will be sufficient to do the things which he believes need to be done for this program in the coming fiscal year. i should like to have the ultimate facts qualified. as the senator from florida has qualified the ultimate facts in regard to the area redevelopment item. with which apparently everyone agrees. as to it. the other body chose to make the senate like it. but gave us everything the law would allow. however. the funds for the open space land grants have been cut from $50 million to $35 million. can the senator from new jersey enlighten us as to whether this reduction will cripple the program. or whether he believes the program can still go forward within reason. adequately. in this fiscal year.
with respect to literacy. this is a proposal which i welcome. because i deeply feel that this is the route to take. rather than to follow the constitutional amendment process. it will be remembered that on the question of the poll tax i received a very substantial number of votes a few years ago. decisively showing that that matter could be dealt with by law. i am delighted that the senator has introduced his bill. i compliment him upon his action. i do so regardless of whether it cuts the ground out from under me. that is quite aher matter. i do  say that unkindly. the important thing is that this is being done. if the president of the united states is behind it. it makes it even more important than if i were for it. i am delighted that the senator has introduced the bill. i have one other question to ask the senator.
this whole subject of the use of peace bonds is interesting to me. because for the last several years i have been urging the treasury department to sell $25 billion worth as a way to deal with the longterm debt of the united states. i wish to compliment the senator from pennsylvania and his colleague for utilizing this type of bond approach to the problem. i am unhappy about the fact that the bonds would be used for a very desirable but rather limited purpose. because what we are doing  is a terrific description of what could greatly excite and get a lot of support from the american people. i congratulate the senator. for a long time senator williams and i and the treasury department have had a goround on the question of calling our savings bonds peace bonds.
. i have long believed that as a matter of fundamental ecoic fact it is both ineffective and. in the long run. injurious to try to solve the problem of overproduction by production controls. quotas or other artificial devices aimed at restraining productivity. this is particularly true when accelerating productivity is largely attributable to tremendous techogical advance. such as we have seen in american agriculture in the past 10 years. american agriculture should  be leashed. its surging forces of inventiveness and abundance should  be frustrated and discouraged. yet clearly it is also a matter of fundamental ecoic fact that these powerful productive forces must be equated with consumption. mr. lippmanns article goes a long way to the heart of this vital matter and points up the urgent need for the congress to reexamine  our approach to a national agricultural policy and to recast it in terms of helping to establish a maximum effective agricultural working force rather than continuing the present approach of attempting to fix production by allocation among the existing agricultural working force. exhbit 1
will the senator agree with me that. as we are facing a trade program which may require certain efforts of workers and business. just as we are facing an automation program. which is essential to the country. of the same character. just as we are facing a new tax law which will encourage reequipment of american industry. which is becoming obsolescent in terms of equipment. we can consider this bill as the final one on the subject. and that hing the senate conferees have done will foreclose us. as the situation develops. from perhaps taking other steps in the direction of training and retraining workers in the national interest.
. new york state is ready to do its part. and i have doubt suffolk county will do its part in connection with this emous project. i hope that the efforts of senttor keating and me. and. interested new york congressmen may result. as senator keating so properly said yesterday. in an acceleration of the work. i understand approximately aher $200.000 will be required beyond the $50.000 which is  in the fiscal 1963 budget in order to expedite and cornplete advance planning and design and thus to expedite the whole project by a year or more. in view of the fact that it takes about 5 years from original recommendation to get construction underway. and in view of the continuing danger which we  see as a result of the terrific damage inland. and the fact that this years damage succeeds blows in 1956 and 1960. which were also very severe. and have a very vivid history. i hope very much that the appropriate committee of the senate and the appropriate committee of the other body will deem it proper to recognize the needs of the people of new york and accelerate this work. new york pays an emous part of the federal taxes. as senator keating and i have pointed out on many occasions. there are few things which the federal government can really do for us in new york. this project is a very significant one. and i hope that we may have accelerated action on it.
madam president. we are putting the situation in focus . and while there are  many senators in the chamber. i am sure that senators will want to understand. from all interested parties. the situation as it is before us. and as i propose. in company with others of my colleagues. to move to substitute for the constitutional amendment a statutory means for eliminating the poll tax. i think i am an interested party in the debate. i might point out that the issue is more new with me than it is something new with the distinguished senator from florida . i proposed the same course in 1960 when the subject was previously before us. i must say that i am somewhat puzzled by the choice of the measure used for this purpose. it happens to be a measure which my colleague and i have introduced. and. i might say pardonably. a measure of some patriotic flavorto save a historical establishment in new york. i. too. understood that it would be a claims bill affecting one person that the subject would be debated on. instead we find it attached to a measure to preserve alexander hamiltons home in new york city as an historical monument. i am in a rather fortunate position in that. i might say. i am able to preserve alexander hamiltons home and have a statutory method to eliminate the poll tax. whereas my distinguished colleague. the senator from florida . mustand i k it will make him very unhappyjettison alexander hamiltons memorial in order to insert a constitutional amendment as a substitute in this bill. but we all understand why this is the greatest chamber on earth. there is a delicacy here which is reflected in the timing and method of the handling of this subject which is really quite unique and embellishes the senate with its reputation throughout the world. i have already explained what puzzles me about the measure chosen. and . the timing. why . we had a literacy bill before the senate the other day that we all discussed and that we were going to move on. the bill was sent to committee. and we have assurancesand i k they will be hoedthat we will be able to consider the whole question in april. . however. we have this question to consider. why. i do  k the reason. but. being a lawyer. i could suspect that what is a reasonable explanation is probably the explanation. the reasonable explanation is that if the senate would set the precedent that a matter of this character has to be done by constitutional amendment. the very same argument will be made in april when we call up the literacy question and the same point will be made that it. too. must be done by constitutional amendment. i enjoyed very much the colloquy between my two colleagues. the senator from georgia and the senator from florida . it had all the freshness of an intimate discussion in a family. i might say that this has really worked pretty well. i k that the senator from florida is very sincere about this matter. but the fact is that we have ambled around here  for 14 years and the poll tax still remains in five states. hing has happened about it.
i am grateful to my colleague for that information. i also was here when the amendment passed the senate and it bogged down in the other body. but the point is that the poll tax still remains as an institution in most of the states which had it before. and though many of us indicated our desire to rid ourselves of this rather obsolescent imbalance. it still hangs around. and i think very largely because we have  taken the statutory route but have chosen heretofore aher.
. i recall with much pleasure the luncheon we gave last may for dr. heinrich von brentaand dr. konrad adenauer. strong champions of the integration of the german people into free europe. i have therefore ed with great interest the insertion just made in the record by the distinguished junior senator from kentucky . i wish to add my felicitations to dr. von brentaupon his  becoming the leader of the majority party in the bundestag. the german parliament. i point out that it is the hope of europe and the hope of the german federal republic that that nation shall come within the framework of constitutional parliamentary government. that it shall be a champion of paneuropism. and that in that way it may give to the world reassurance that the tremendous talents of its people for creativity and productivity will be devoted to the service of freedom and of mankind. dr. von brentabrings new strength and dignity to the institution of the elected parliament at a time when popular government everywhere is challenged by communist dictatorship. i have supported the aims and efforts of the west german government under chancellor adenauer to help democracy take root where nazism flourished less than two decades ago. i believe we must allow the german people every opportunity to earn their place in the family of free nations by a demonstration of successful parliamentary government. they should have our help and moral support in establishing democratic rule on a firm basis. dr. von brentais a stanch champion of democracy and the free world. and his devotion to european unity is well kn. members of the senate may recall meeting him early last year at the luncheon held in the capitol when he accompanied chancellor konrad adenauer. i had the ho to be one of the hosts at that luncheon. which was attended by members of all branches of our government as well as by a number of private citizens. and to hear dr. von brentapledge the german federal republics adherence to the nations of the free world. in his new post as a leader of parliament. he will have a fresh vantage point from which to strengthen popular government in west germany and the integration of free europe.
i am glad the senator has brought up this very important point. and i am very glad that we can clarify the situation. in the first place. my amendment contains the words "or other tax or to impose a property qualification." the language is found at page 2. lines 15 and 16. that is forbidden as a prerequisite for registering to vote or voting. that is the first point. and it is a very important point. in the second place. let us remember that what we do is to give us the flexibility of a statute. so that if there is abuse we can move into it and act on it. whereas what the senator from florida would have us do is take the constitutional amendment route. then we are lashed to two propositions: first. that we then can implement whatever it says. and whatever it does  say we can implement. if we want to change it. we can only move by way of a constitutional amendment. because we have moved. in the first instance. by the constitutional amendment route. i respectfully submit that here is a very powerful reason why we should proceed by the statutory route and  by the constitutional amendment route. i am very grateful to the senator for bringing up this point.
and the organization for ecoic cooperation and development. to which we are a party. the other point which is very important to emphasize is that it is true that we carry the major share of the worlds responsibility. it is also true that we produce a great share of the worlds goods and have a vast share of the worlds product. indeed. we have more than 50 percent of the gross national product of the entire atlantic community. and other nations are carrying. in relation to their gross national product. comparable burdens. and in some cases greater burdens. in terms of defense. but we all recognize that we could do a better job with what we are using in the way of resources if we would coordinate better. we recognize also that with the greater development of the newly developing areas. the base of that effort will be broadened. with respect to all these considerations i think the senator is absolutely correct. we must have some dramatic confrontation on the highest level which will bring all the component parts into focus. the point i would like to make with the senatorand i appreciate the senators observations on itis that  only is this important for us who are carrying the burden. but it is also important for others. who complain that they are  given egh credit. considering what they do within their resources. to show what they are doing and also to bring up the backsliders. we talk a great deal about summits. the senator is talking about an ecoic summit.
i hope. since the senator is a lawyer. he will  mind the length of my question. would the senator give us his view as to the posture of the administration in this matter. bearing in mind that all during last year civil rights legislation was requested at all. and that the general estimate of the civil rights legislation requested this year. in respect to the two bills relating to poll taxes and the literacy test. is that though they are important measures they fail to represent the really significant achievements in respect of civil rights which are dictated by the situation in the country. and bearing in mind that. when viewed in the light of riots. of freedom rides. of sitins. of waitins. of prayins. and the tremendous militancy which is developing in this field. there must be some way to give tongue and outlet to this feeling by such a tremendous mass of americans. rather than trying this small salve or bandaid. and then even abandoning that with the first strong wind that blows in the shape of two cloture votes. would the senator also tell us how he compares the amount of administration effort expended in respect to mustering a twothirds vote for cloture. bearing in mind that it takes a lot of effort to do that. with the administration effort expended. for example. in respect to reorganizing the rules committee in the other body. i would appreciate having the senators comments on those matters.
madam president. at his news conference last week. president kennedy was deeply exercised about what he considered to be an untruthful campaign against his plan to withhold tax on dividends and interest. certainly some of the literature on this matter has been inaccurate. but this controversial legislative proposal is hardly defensible on that ground. for it fails to meet the test of practicality. as i see the question. this is the acid test. secretary of the treasury dillons revised proposals on the dividend and interest withholding tax provisions are concessions. to be sure. but they serve to reenforce the serious doubts held by me and many others concerning the application of the withholding system to this kind of income. secretary dillons two major concessionsthe first. permitting exemption certificates to stand until changed by the taxpayer. as under the present wage withholding system. and the second. extending exemption from dividend withholding to profit organizationsare among the suggestions made by witnesses. including myself. at the hearings held by the senate finance committee. but these suggestions were made only to cover the eventuality that the treasury would persist in its adherence to withholding. hing that has been said since then removes the major questions raised about the equity and practicality of the withholding provisions themselves. first. analyses show that more than 80 percent of interest payments are made to accounts receiving $50 or more annually in interestless than 20 percent of the total number of accounts. is it wise to throw a net of inconvenience over 55 million savingsaccount. christmasclub. and other account holders. for the purpose of catching that fraction of a small miity which is responsible for most of the estimated $370 million in tax revenue recoverable from interest payments. second. in may of 1961 the treasury testified that 90 percent of dividend income is  reported. but a scientific survey by internal revenue revealed a few months later that this might well be raised to 95 percent. is it wise to subject 12 to 14 million stockholders and thousands of banks and other payors of dividends to a complex system of collection in order to bring in revenue which could turn out to be only onehalf of the $280 million treasury estimate of recoverable tax which was based on the 90percent reporting figure. third. even if the treasurys estimates of $650 millio somewhat more. according to the most recent projectionsin revenue recoverable through withholding of interest and dividend income are fairly accurate. this would still account for less than 1 percent of the total revenue of $78 billion to be collected through corporate and individual income taxes in fiscal 1963-$40 billion of which would be from individual withholding. is it wise to institute a system as comprehensive in scope as our present wage and salary withholding systemfor it would include  only the 55 million interest recipients but also 12 to 14 million stockholders plus millions of othersfor the purpose of collecting such a small percentage of revenup from income. fourth. the commissioner of internal revenue himself estimates that $200 million of the unpaid revenue would  be collected if automatic data processing were in effect. it will be in full effect within 4 years. it is believed that the $180 million in revenue which the treasury attributes to the expected psychological effect of a withholding system on upper income bracket tax evaders alone will be collected as well under an adequately publicized automatic data processing system. thus. a large part of the treasury estimate of $650 million in recoverabli revenue appears to be recoverable through means  being instituted anyhow. it should be ed that neither the treasury estimates  the others here cited take into fuil account the effect of the educational campaign launched by the banking institutions. in cooperation with the treasury. to make interest and dividend recipients aware of their tax obligations. is it wise to begin  a system with complex and comprehensive implications for most of our taxpaying citizens and for thousands of our banks and other financial institutions. on the basis of speculative estimates of revenue gain. when much of this revenue can be expected as the result of procedures recently instituted. in raising these questions. i do  mean to imply that useful measures to assure full and equitable tax collection should  be taken. i suggest that much can be done to make the new procedure of automatic data processing and the educational campaign more effective. i propose the following alternatives to withholding: first. require payors of interest to report to the treasury annual payments of interest of $50 or moreinstead of the present $600with the recipients tax number. and to send a duplicate of this report to the recipient with a clear ice that the amount reported is subject to taxation. and provide for reducing this figure to a minimum of $10. by regulation. if experience shows that there is a materially increased splitting of accounts. second. require the same procedure of payors of dividends of $10 or moreall of whom are already sending reports for such amounts to the treasury but  to the recipient. third. require the taxpayer to answer "yes" or " on the income tax return to the questions: "do you have a savings account." and "do you own stock in a corporation." and. if the answer is yes. to annex to the income tax return a copy of the report sent by the payor. i respectfully submit. madam president. if these things are done there is every likelihood we shall achieve the same good results  achieved with respect to dividends of $10 or more. madam president. reaction to the tax proposal in the country has been widespread. largely on the ground of its practicality. there is question of morality involved. the taxes are admittedly due. it seems to me that the members of the committee and we in the senate should address our best judgment to the issue of practicality. and it is in that spirit i have made these suggestions.
. this is the proposal which i outlined to the committee on finance during my testimony on tuesday. may 3. it is in the nature of a substitute for the present section 13 of h.r. 10650. i have submitted a draft of the amendment for the committees consideration. however. i believe that the printing of the proposed amendment could be helpful to other members of congress who are interested in maintaining the competitiveness of u.s. oversea investments. the principal reason for my introduction of this substitute is that the legislation proposed by the administration fails to distinguish between the correction of specific tax abuses and the need to avoid measures which will discourage continued and expanded participation by the u.s. private sector in the international ecoy. the proposal to tax currently the undistributed earnings of oversea subsidiaries of american corporations is in sharp contrast to the policies of many other nations whose investors compete with american private enterprise for preeminence in world markets. for example. the earnings of dutch and french companies resulting from foreign operations are  taxed at all by their governments. in the united kingdom. companies which are appropriately organized and operate outside of the country do  have to pay a tax on their profits until distribution within the united kingdom. in belgium and way dividend income from foreign subsidiaries is taxed at a reduced rate. the international responsibilities and the domestic welfare of the united states demand an expansion a contractio u.s. private investment overseas. i believe that the amendment i am proposing will strengthen the measures designed to prevent tax evasion while having a minimal adverse effect on the continued. natural. ecoically sound flow of investment. this proposed amendment to section 13 of h.r. 10650 is designed to tax u.s. shareholders of certain foreign corporations without deferral. if the earnings and profits of such corporations are accumulated unreasonably abroad rather than being paid to the shareholders as dividends. in effect. section 13 so amended would treat the deferral of foreign corporation profits as tax avoidance only if there is businessrelated reason for such deferral. rather than as per se tax avoidance as does section 13 in its pending form. it should be ed that other than section 13. sections 6 and 16 of h.r. 10650 accomplish a great deal to eliminate true tax abuses in the foreign field. modified by the amendment i have submitted to the committee. section 13 would constitute a relatively direct approach to the problem of taxation of profits of foreign corporations controlled by u.s. persons. because it is a direct approach. it would be effective primarily as implemented by regulations of the internal revenue service and decisions of the courts. hence. it would be neatly tailored to do precisely what is sought to be done. namely. to take the romance out of runaway earnings and profits which are escaping taxation because they are being held abroad. but at the same time  prevent american companies which are engaged in productive activities and productive investment abroad from continuing in that way. they will be able effectively to compete with companies of other countries. such as great britain. france. germany. and italy. one of the great objections to the foreign tax provision in the bill as it is  before the committee on finance is that it would disadvantage american companies in such competition. the amendment to section 13 is modeled basically on sections 531 through 537 of the internal revenue code which tax the accumulated earnings of domestic corporations. however. certain changes were made necessary because of the different contexts in which the two sets of provisions would operate. the principal change is that the provisions contained in section 534 of the code relating to the shifting of burden of proof to the government would  be applied to foreign corporations because the commissioner is at a greater disadvantage in obtaining factual information overseas. apart from these differences. i believe that the accumulated earnings approach patterned upon section 531 of the code offers a valid test for differentiating between taxhaven and legitimate operations abroad. in keeping with the policy objectives which i have urged. and which are those of the administration and of the devotees of a bipartisan policy on the part of the united states. i have doubt that the committee on finance will give the most serious consideration to my amendment. but i desired to call it to the attention of other senators who are similarly being consulted by their constituents who conduct operations abroad. in the hope that it might enlist their interest as the subject is developed before the committee on finance.
it is true. i believe that three kinds of tax cuts are possible. whatever one may think about the subject. the first is the kind which the senator has explained. the classic tax cut. by a reduction of expenditures. aher tax cut would be a tax cut for incentives. if it were felt that management is  doing all it should do because of 90percent tax rates. one might wish to cut the rate to 89 percent. to induce management to be more productive. the third kind of possible tax cut is one which can be made when signs of a recession are apparent. in an effort to head off the recession. perhaps the senator would  favor that. but i would. one might find it necessary to head off a recession by taking action on a different type of tax cut. each of those types of tax cut is of a specialized ecoic character. i agree with the senators point of view. whatever may be the diversity of our ideology. that we will get ourselves into a very bad position if. for strictly political purposes. we engage in a tax cut without any of the indicia which warrant it. which  only would complicate our budget structure. as the senator has said. but also would add to our problems with respect to and complicate very materially our international balance of payments. one of the gravest problems we face is the problem that foreigners will draw down their balances if they think americans are being improvident in a financial sense. the senator is to be complimented for his remarks and for bringing this subject out into the open. i shall seek reelection this year. also. i do  wish to do so at the cost of deceiving the people. i k the senator has never lived in that way. it is necessary to tell the people what the proposals mean. if the people want a tax cut withstanding the dangers and the difficulties. we can think about it again. but the people certainly should understand what it will mean. i am glad the senator has presented the problem.
. by stating that the program which i propose is designed. first. to enable the deprived income groups better to meet their basic needs as rapidly as possible. thereby also helping to increase the effective demand for food. clothing. and fiber products. most of which are in excess supply at current prices. but which have also relatively narrow price flexibility. this kind of increase in demand is less likely to result in inflationary pressures than an acrosstheboard stimulation of demand at current price levels. .which would tend to stabilize itself finally in slightly increased demand at higher price levels. that is the first point. we should take advantage of greater demand and bring on stable price levels. secondly. this program is designed to enable business to plan for and actually set the machinery of increased orders in motion for the modernization and diversification of plant. equipment. and marketing. an important element of this point is the sharpening of the individuals incentive to make profits and  have them swallowed up by the government. after they reach a fairly high figure. the ecoic and psychological readjustment inherent in the stock market decline can become the sound base for greatly accelerated ecoic growth. but it can do so only if we provide the room for such growth. and very importantlyand it is the whole point of my statement todaywe must have a clear view of what is ahead in taxes. so that we will k that taxes are geared to the challenges and opportunities of our times. i therefore urge. first. that the administration abandon what is untenable in the pending tax bill and thereby make it possible to pass the bill. we would increase our revenue take by over $500 million a year. second. i urge that  later. but . he send us an incentive tax program so that the congress may make its contribution to the restoration of confidence in the minds of the american business community. congress has a big and responsible role to play. it can do it if it has something to sink its teeth in. i close by emphasizing that when i use the term "business." i mean  only business management or security ownersthough today they number 14 to 16 millionbut also some 80 million people having savings bank accounts. life insurance policies. or interest in pension and welfare funds. our whole ecoy is built on the structure of values represented by the stock exchange and its affiliated security exchanges. i therefore emphasize that business consists  only of managers and investors. but also the workers who depend upon the business structure for their livelihood. it includes also the farmer and the consumer. it is in that sense which i have made the proposal.
in the plan which i have proposed. the deficit which would result would be . considerable. rather. let me say that it would  increase the deficit. i say that for this reason. if we pass the pending tax bill without the disputed provisions to which i have referred. it will result in bringing in about $500 million in revenue. if we balance out the rest of this program as i have suggested. what i propose will. generally speaking. perhaps with a years lag. balance itself out. of course. one part or aher may fall by the wayside. for example. i have suggested a rather moderate reduction in the oil depletion allowance. the reason for my suggestion is that i have a theory. i am grateful to the senator from colorado and to the senator from florida for enabling me to pinpoint my belief. or my theory. my theory is that what is required is  an increase in revenue or a diminution in it. what is required is certainty. and also the removal from the tax structure of what modern times demonstrate to be certain inequities of a major ecoic kind.
i would say that that would be a question of magnitude. if we run to a few hundred million dollars more in a deficit. it would be worth it. if we ran to a billion dollars in deficit. we would get to the point of return. with a $78 billion tax take from these various taxes. i would say even a modest increase in the deficit. if forced upon us by the exigencies of the situation. would be worthwhile. considering what we would have accomplished by it. i would  be prepared to subscribe to anything that would  represent the restoration of confidence with a balanced approach. within reason. as i have described.
. in our view. the finance committee was right the first time it dealt with this matter. let us remember that about 10 days ago the finance committee reported the taxrate extension bill with respect to persons traveling on railroads and buses. and called for removal of the existing tax on july 1. 1962. but on saturday the committee called back the bill. and later reported it again. but this time with a provision for removal of the existing tax as of october 1. 1962. it seems to us that. at the very least. senators who represent states in which are located great centers of commuter travel. such as new york city. and senators who represent states contiguous to such centers of commuter travelfor instance. connecticut. from which travelers and commuters feed into new york city via the new york. new haven & hartford railroadshould favor july 1 as the date for the removal of the existing tax. rather than october 1. and also should take the position that a january 1 date is completely unacceptable. as the finance committee agreed in both its first report and its second report. i do  believe the railroads can be treated in the same way the airlines are treated. because i believe it is generally agreed that the situation of the railroads is much worse than that of the airlines. and in any case. aside from the matter of income. it is very much worse in terms of the sums received from the government. after all. the airlines are still the recipients of very large benefits from the government. whereas over the years such assistance has been phased out. insofar as the railroads are concerned. it was my desire and that of the senators who have joined me in sponsoring this amendment to submit a much narrower amendment. in order that our intent in that connection may be clear. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record. in connection with my remarks. that amendment. which i  send to the desk.
. i shall detain the senate only a minute. in connection with the subject discussed by the senator from delaware . it is extremely significant that the new york stock exchange has just released its 1962 stockholders census. which finds that 1 out of every 6 americans is today a shareowner. as compared with 1 out of 8 in 1959 and 1 out of 16 in 1952. the specific figures show that 17.010.000 americans  own stocks. when we add to that number the more than 80 million americans who have life insurance policies and savings bank deposits and those who are interested in pension and welfare funds or have similar interests which depend upon investments. we begin to see why a serious debacle in the stock market. such as the one we have had. impairs the willingness and will of americans to go forward. and why it is absolutely essential to give some incentive and indication by the government that that confidence is justified which we ask of people in order to enable that ecoy to go forward. i have advocated the kind of tax cut which would be an incentive tax cut and which could be compensated by other matters in a package such. for example. as getting the boggeddown present tax bill enacted into law by taking out of it what we k can be passed. such as the provision relating to the withholding tax on interest and dividends. and by doing something about oil depletion. which can bring in additional revenue to the federal government. by reducing the taxes of those in the lowest and highest brackets and making some token reduction in the corporate income tax. we could give america the signal to go forward. i think we can understand the blow to confidence in what has occurred when we see that 17 million americans are directly involved. those are  manipulative bourbons in the old sense of stock exchange parlance. it represents the considered judgment of a great section of the american people. indeed. there is new backbone. we have always talked about it in terms of the farm. without in any way detracting from or depreciating the value and independence of our farmers. in the 17 million direct security holders is the new vertebra of our country. the new backbone of the american ecoic system. it is that particular voice which i think needs to be listened to . i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record an editorial entitled "seventeen million stockholders." published in the daily news today.
madam president. i should like to refer my colleague to the language on page 47. lines 8 to 12. of the amendments. which provides for a carrier which is exempt from income tax under the internal revenue code. and thereby would open a door to profit organizations of all characters. whether they are cooperative groups. unions. fraternal organizations. or otherwise. i also call to the attention of my colleague the fact that the definitions which are contained in the bill also relate to private carriers. that is. profitmaking carriers. and would require them either to be national in scope. in terms very analogous to the kind of carriers that function under the federal governments employees insurance plan-
i have conferred with the senator from minnesota rather constantly on tax policy. i agree with him that the new depreciation schedules. which have been long overdue. will be of real benefit to business. but i hope very much we will  move into completing action on the tax bill. which is being voted on in the finance committee. get it to the floor of the senate and vote on it. so that it may produce additional revenue. get that done and then have a look at the need for some tax reform. perhaps tax reduction. in order to deal with the present exigencies. i agree with the senator from minnesota that this action has been needed. it is  so much a question of amount as it is the right placement of the relief at a point where it can do the most good to our ecoy today. i agree with the senator thoroughly that that is the virtue of this readjustment of depreciation schedules.
i should like to make a correction. if the senator from illis will refer to my amendment. he will find that it concerns group plans which are qualified. written by any company. ab well as those companies and organizations which are tax exempt. they are fully qualified. the 10percent figure is incorrect. it is 5 percent. and i am informed that there are at least 200 insurance companies. if  more. that will qualify under that option. i just make that as a statement of fact.
on the question of a proposed tax cut. the senator will remember that this morning the committee on banking and currency considered the prospective ination of a member of the council of ecoic advisers. possibly by this time the ination has been approved. personally i believe in an incentive tax cut. i agree with the senator that such a cut should  be negated by other agencies of the government. does  the senator accept what dr. ackerly defined as a difference between an acrosstheboard tax cut which would increase the deficit. and a change in the fundamental structure of the tax system which could give incentive to new investment as well as incentive to the consumption of hard goods and the purchase of housing. is that  really what we ought to do in view of past experience. we can wait until it happens. that is the danger in the present situation. we are edging over into a position in which our past experience indicates that we are likely to have a downturn rather than an upturn.
businessmen do  want that kind of tax cut. perhaps they are wrong. i agree with the senator from wisconsin that they do  want such a cut. a change in depreciation schedule is good. but it is  a fundamental change. in the sense that the formula in the law remains. we can bring about a materially greater increase in government buying if we change the fundamental formula by which depreciation is ascertained. which. incidentally. would also have a tendency to bring taxes down by perhaps aher $1 billion in a very good area. the other point i had in mind is that provision would be made for corporations. perhaps it would be as little as two points. the other point is that a measure should eliminate all taxes on people who axe earning less than $2.000. it is fantastic that people earning less than $2.000 still pay a tax. which results in an income to the government of about $500 million. also. we should do something about those in the very high brackets. there should be a reduction from a rate of 91 percent to 65 percent. it seems to me that what we are shooting forand i think it would be wonderful if we could get itis a measure of agreement between thoughtful people like the senator from wisconsin. perhaps myself. and others who have spoken on the subject on an incentive tax cut which would be accepted as an incentive. that is the trouble with an equipment credit. it is  accepted as an incentive. very clearly. the business community would  use it for that purpose. i hope very much that the senator will continue what he is doing. i will continue what i am doing along those two lines. first. there should be a tax cut of an incentive character. i feel strongly on that subject i think  is the time. we should be vigilant to see that it is  washed out by a high interest rate police or other monkey business on the part of some government agency. i am delighted to join in the colloquy with the senator from wisconsin in order to develop our ideas together.
i shall support the senators amendment. although i have never before voted for reductions in this budget. because i think it is time that we stopped escalating. with all respect and deference. i wish to leave congress free to act. i voted against confining the appropriation to the budget figure. but the business of the senate escalating the house figure must end somewhere. i think the senator from massachusetts has provided us with an excellent opportunity to do so.
madam president. i favor an incentive tax cut. and that is why i favor the adoption of this amendment. if we are to have an incentive tax cutand we have already looked toward following that routewe must proceed at this time in a responsible fashion to lay the necessary groundwork for the making of such a tax cut. since we have already anticipated the making of a tax cut in order that the funds thus made available will be fed into the ecoy. therefore we must make some retrenchment in these expenditures. i voted against cuts in these items. except in the item for the national institutes of health. i am sure that if this amendment is adopted. when it comes from conference it will come in such a form that the secretary will have power to exercise discretion in applying this reduction as between the various appropriation items. such a provision could  be included in this amendment. because then it would be subject to a point of order. but i k that is what the senator from kentucky has in mind. if we believe that the ecoy needs the incentive of a tax cut. certainly this amendment should be agreed to. and i join the senator from kentucky in supporting it.
the senator has asked me two questions. i will answer the first question first. i think the tax bill which is pending in the committee has been pretty well washed up. i think. therefore. whatever benefit we get in that regard will  represent affirmative aid to the ecoy of the major character which i contemplated when i referred to an incentive tax cut.
as to the trade expansion bill. i think there will be a trade expansion bill. but i do  think it measures up to what i have said. because it is  strictly part of the new frontier. i think it forces itself upon us by urgency of the european common market and its success. and the fact that we would have had to have a trade program. incidentally. the reciprocal trade agreements act expired on june 30. 1962. so we had to have aher bill. but i do  want to detract from the presidents activities in that regard. i think we will have a trade bill. i think we will have it before the end of the session. however. i say again. it is my judgment that a trade bill could have been gotten sooner and with greater impact on the ecoy in terms of the erosion of confidence. and that the presidentalthough we can give him an "a" for effortcould have exercised a more effective leadership role in that regard. however. that is  my main point.  is my main point the point which the senator desires to wish on me as my main point. namely. that the tax proposal represents the erosion of confidence which i refer to. i think the erosion of confidence is the composite of everything that has occurred. it is  due to one thing. it is  due to the fact that the president has been indecisive about a tax cut. i think it started. in point of time. with the excessive means used in dealing with the steel price increase. i think that was a very serious clue to the american business community as to the temper of the president and what has been called decisiveness. i think it represented. to a degree. a lack of sophistication in terms of adequacy of the means and the purpose. which made a very serious impression on the american business community. i think that event began the process of the erosion of confidence. which has been compounded by the other factors which i have discussed. also. i may say the senator has  mentioned what was the main point of my speech. that we have  yet had any really major demonstration of what the new frontier was going to do in order to get our ecoy moving. the only thing i was able to ascertain which could be clearly attributable to new frontier initiative was the peace corps. in other respects i think we have had either initiative or ideas. or they were carryovers from the previous administration and pretty much the general policy of the country. i have suggested. for example. a whole series of things. the senator from wisconsin has been most gracious in what he has said about me. the senator ks i reciprocate fully in my admiration for his diligence and his mind. what i suggested was a whole kit of actions which could be done in government. in business. and in labor. which. when added to an incentive tax cut. could put us on that wonderful. hard road of moving the country forward. i am talking about a composite of these aspects of the matter. and  one thing. the indecisiveness of the president on a tax cut.
i am sorry. two people judge differently. i. on the other hand. got the distinct impressionthough that is by means my whole casethat the four men were worried about where our ecoy is going and fear a recession unless very determined means are taken to head it off. indeed. the incentive tax cut idea is the one thing they all agreed on as being highly desirable and necessary.
i can agree with the senator on either of his premises. for this reason: in the first place. tax cuts are largely psychological. they make people feel a little more ample. that "this is the time to go forward." beyond that. there is a facilitation of demand even in the lower income brackets. if  as a result of spending by those taxpayers then as the result of spending on goods. which has a material effect on the people with whom they do business. the people directly involved may  buy a house. but the tradesmen with whom they do business may buy houses. new equipment is responsive to new demand. and so on. i think the most important part of the incentive tax cut idea. moving it into the lowest brackets and into the brackets above the lowest brackets. is in regard to a reestablishment of the feeling that there is a development in the ecoy. that there is spending power. that we can "move forward." to adopt the presidents words. i can agree with the senator about the entrepreneurial practice. we are facing an issue of fact. i k we shall have very definitive evidence on that question. i am a lawyer of some experience. as the senator ks. i think i k a number of people who come into those tax brackets of from 65 to 91 percent. i will tell the senator that there are many people who are in the upper levels of income. and that there is way of avoiding the taxes. matter how intelligent they may be taxwise. this has a deleterious effect  so much as to what the government takes. as the senator ks from my figureswhether the figures are off $50 million or $100 million is immaterial. for they are in that magnitudebecause the government does  take so much in absolute money. but instead as representing a stop of a mans activity. for instance. let us consider the case of a construction magnate in new york. who reaches a point. in the course of the year. when he says. "all right. what is the use of doing more. why push myself. why work late hours. why get up early. why go to chicago. instead of staying home in westchester county and playing golf. there is use in doing so." i am a person with some experience in that regard. new york is a very enterprising place and has a lot of people who are in that income group. i can testify to the senator that this tax provision has an idinate influence in terms of the creative mind and the drive and the push which are associated with american enterprise. i think it would be really a very helpful and salutary benefit to the ecoy if that incentive could be restored.
i will say to my colleague that we have taken our fair proportion of the time of the senate in discussing this problem. i should like to conclude my part of the discussion by using the words of archimedes. who said: give me a lever long egh. and a fulcrum strong egh. and singlehanded i can move the world. so in urging the establishing of what i consider to be a $7 billion tax cut rather than a $4 billion tax cut. as a critical element of a package which is very much more inclusive than that. i speak in terms of a lever. which would get us going. which would give us the momentum. to which all other things can contribute.
i can agree with the senator for two reasons. first. a tax cut would  mean an increase in deficit. it might mean a very much smaller deficit when we extend the experience over a period of more than 1 year. for example. history has shown such a result in 1954. second. the best evidence of what is thought by the business community is that the business community thinks exactly to the contrary. the u.s. chamber of commerce has come out for a tax cut even larger than the one i have proposed. the aflcio has also done so. if my memory serves me correctly. the other day we had a report from a rather conservative public banking institution in europe. i think it is the bank for international settlements. i may be wrong about the source. but it is the same type of source which also carried out the same general point of view that the chamber of commerce has carried and that the aflcio has carried. whatever may have been their differences as to the terms of the tax cut. i might point out to the senator the idea of a budget deficit is. in these relatively prosperous european countries. apparently much better understood and accepted than in ours. the question is the aggregate of ecoic activity. what people want to k is  only what the deficit of a country isbecause. after all. a country can pretty much control its deficit. depending on how that country taxes itselfbut the question is. what is the total aggregate of the countrys worth. the worth of a country is attributable  only to its fixed assets but also its earnings. to use a business term. it is the business turer that we are trying to generate by an incentive tax cut. i am  for a tax cut that would simply put money into the pockets of people so they can spend it. i am for a tax cut that would apply with the greatest selectivity at the point where it could do the most good in terms of engendering purchasing power which we want and the type of expansion which we want. that is my whole point.
madam president. i call the attention of the senate today to a lead editorial in the new york herald tribune entitled "tax cut  the only remedy" because i think it bears out so very strikingly the speech which i delivered yesterday on that subject. a tax cut is  the only remedy. i could  agree more. but it is a very important part of a package. and a good deal of that package is laid out in the lead editorial exactly as i laid it out yesterday. a package to deal with what. the uneasy fear in the hearts of many americans that we are coming to a time of aher recession. and that it should be avoided. our ecoy is  moving forward with the velocity which is required by our international responsibilities or by the wellbeing of the american people. withstanding the presidents promise in 1960. on which he was elected. that that is precisely what he would do. so as long as that is the situation. and it is evidenced by a rise in our gross national product  equal to our own or the presidents expectation by the absence of an opportunity for an estimated 1 million young people to get jobs in that ecoy. all of those things add up to the fact that we do  have to wait until a recession is upon us.  do we have to engage in such transient activities as awaiting the figures for a particular month in order to decide a question as big and as important as that. we ought to have an incentive tax cut. there has been a great deal of talk about a tax cut without recognizing the difference between a tax cut which would merely put money into the pockets of people and a tax cut which would provide an incentive to build. initiate. construct. and employ. as i described yesterday. but more important than anything else is the fact that other things must be done. these are also questions to which the president must direct his attention. for example. among them is the fact that we have effective way today to deal with strikes which affect the national interest. it is very much in the interest of labor itself to work with the rest of us in trying to develop a better method of dealing with strikes than we have today. that is one of the real weaknesses of our society. second. that the administration of the antitrust laws both in the preceding administration and in the present tends to inhibit and frustrate instead of facilitate. and that therefore the administration should direct its views and activities toward that end. third. and very important. american business has  developed an effective technique for seeing workers through the transition period when automation is adopted in order to cut costs. these urgent matters are urged for action on the part of our congress and on the part of our president. the editorial sets forth all of these ideas. with the exception of one. and that is that it urges the application to trade unions of the antitrust laws. or their principle. i do  agree. i believe the prescription i have given with respect to strikes is a much better one. other than that it poses the issue to the american people and says that here is an opportunity to act in order to avoid a recession before it is upon us. i am in favor of that. an incentive tax cut is  the whole answer. it is only one part of the total package which i urge upon the president and the country. i ask unanimous consent that the editorial may be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
. finally. i wish to make a comment upon the appearance of secretary of the treasury dillon before the joint ecoic committee this morning. i urged the secretary to submit to the congress before adjournment the administrations plan for tax revision. on two grounds: first. that it would be very reassuring to k some of the ways of avoiding the danger of recession by showing people what they had a right to expect in their planning and estimates. second. it would enable the country and the congress to really submit this tax plan to the electorate and come back here in january prepared to vote on it.
i believe the senator from florida has put his finger on something that is critically important. we have the concept of absolutes in the way of money without realizing that we are in big business. and that the very size of our whole effort must be proportioned to what we do about it. $75 million in absolute terms is a great deal of money. but  in terms of a $500 billion ecoy. and when we compare it with the thousandbilliondollar production in the atlantic community. which is the production we are talking about. it is mighty small. the american people. in my opinion. are  frightened by the fact that they earn an annual average of $6.000 or $7.000 or $8.000 and that we are talking about $100 million or $1 billion. they have egh wisdom to realize that it is necessary to deal with that kind of ecoy to give them the security of both jobs and peace that they send us here to create for them in the best way we can.
i think we want to have the issue clear as between us. i shall  support this proposal on the trickledown theory. because i agree with the senator about that. i think it is a very expensive way to spend tax money. but i certainly would appreciate having the views of the senator on the more fundamental question. to me. of remachining american industrial plants and giving inducements for that purpose. i am aware of the senators extraordinarily fine leadership in respect to depreciation. i pay him all ho for that. i think that is a very potent factor in what we are trying to accomplish. nevertheless. i feel that the 7percent tax credit must be discussed in these terms. the senator has a right to his views as to the trickledown theory. and i think he has made a legitimate point about the administration. i was only explaining the view of one senator on his side of the aisle as to why i would favor this proposal. because i feel that even though there is a little improvement in depreciation. and i would willingly join with the senator from delaware. who has shown extraordinary leadership in getting more of a depreciation system for equipment. a system more along the european line. which is designed to encourage business to remachine. i still feel that with this opportunity available. it is so important in terms of reequipping american industry that. to me. it outweighs any other consideration. i shall take that position. i agree with the senator from delaware that the system should  be justified. and i do  think it could be justified. on the trickledown theory. because that is a very expensive way to spend tax money.
i merely wish to tell the senator that i have inventoried this question with the committee on federal taxation of the new york state society of certified public accountants. their analysis of existing law would. in my view. sustain the senators position. i intend to vote that way. if the senator will allow me. i should like to ask unanimous consent to include my exchange of correspondence in the record.
 to put before us in principle his tax plan for next year. at least in this way the ecoy can obtain some view of what is ahead and the congress will then be able to act with the deliberation essential to thoroughgoing reform of our tax system.
i should like. first. to express my satisfaction with the senators typical courtesy in joining me as a sponsor of his amendment. i have a similar amendment which was proposed to the committee. of which the senator is a distinguished member. i shall speak in due course in support of the amendment. i wished to interrupt the senator at this point because what the senator is saying is very pertinent. he speaks about the effort which one or two or three firms are making to avoid taxes. and the effort that is made to eliminate such avoidance. we can never completely cure that situation. because there will always be some lawyers. some accountants. and some firms figuring out how to defraud the government. and we must avoid the effort that is being employed in this manner to throttle the whole american effort overseas. when it comes my turn to speak. i shall try to demonstrate how unfairly this provision would work for the people in whom the senator and i are interested. namely. the new firms. the young firms. the adventurous firms that are going into the foreign market. this also has its effect upon the program of expansion of trade on the part of the united states. it would be most harmful. it seems to me. and we would be cutting off our e to spite our face in dealing with the company which is trying to use this tax haven. and we would materially thwart the national purpose. it is a very significant point. and i am glad the senator is making it.
it is saidand i believe it to be very important to have this recordedthat country. neither the united states  any other country. has tried. except in the case of a foreign personal holding company. to establish this kind of tax consequences. because one happens to own stock in a company operating overseas.
king as we do so well how taxes are avoided. matter how well we write the laws. with the help of highpriced talent employed for that purpose. i believe that our provision. which gives the collector the opportunity by regulation or by administration to keep abreast of the situation all the time. would likely tighten the situation more than a set of strict rules would. because very astute gentlemen. studying them day by day and year by year. would find effective ways in which to avoid them.
i should like to make a further observation. if the senator will permit me to do so. does  the senator feel with meas i have felt ever since i entered this complex and important fieldthat what we are dealing with is much more a foreign policy matter than a tax matter. and that we really ought to look at the situation from that standpoint. rather than from the tax point of view.
i thank the senator from nebraska for his very pertinent and wise observations. which are extremely helpful to the total argument. i should like to deal  with a subject which is perhaps most native to me in terms of my experience in congress. that is. the basic distinction which is made. or attempted to be made. in the proposed legislation between investments or subsidiaries which operate in developed countries and those which operate in less developed countries. let it be clear that the income which we are talking about as it comes from the less developed countries must  only be income which is derived from those countries as a practical matter. but also must be the result of income which comes from a reinvestment in those countries. it must be derived from and reinvested in those countries. i think the distinction here is  only artificial but is also likely to be very damaging. for the reason that the main thrust of our present effort to equalize the situation in terms of exports between ourselves and the european common market is today directed toward the investments in these very subsidiaries in the european common market countries. which tomorrow will be much more powerful. for i have doubt that the british and the members of the socalled outer seventhe european trade associationwill become members of it. this proposed tax law loads the situation against the very companies which right  should be encouraged. in order to protect the american position in this way. rather than be discouraged and penalized by it. furthermore. we are trying to get the developed countries to share with us the responsibility for foreign aid to the less developed countries. and one of the big ways we can do that is by doing business in the developed countries in a creative way. in the effort to work out those arrangements with businesses in those countries. but this committee amendment would go in exactly the opposite direction. by placing a heavy penalty on that operation. in addition. the committee amendment would prevent the supplying from the developed countries to the less developed countries which these firms will wish to do. because the test would be that the investment must have been attributable to one in a less developed country. therefore. our whole effort to help in the development of the less developed countries would be thwarted by these tax provisions. it seems to me this committee amendment is completely inconsistent with the whole basic policy we are adopting with respect to world ecoic cooperation. with respect to our trade policy. with respect to our investment policy. with respect to the relationships between american businesses and foreign businesses. and with respect to the competition between american businesses and foreign businesses. as i developed in the course of my colloquy with the senator from minnesota. it will  produce more taxes. on the contrary. i am more and more becoming convinced that it will produce less taxes. whereas the flexibility and the power available under our amendment with respect to the unreasonable accumulation o. surplus will give the collector of internal revenue an infinitely greater opportunity to keep up with the developments of business and industry in their legal aspects as they relate to the tax law. and to do so in a more effective way than he could under such a fixed provision of the tax law which would enable keen mindswhich always are directed to studying the tax lawsto find new means of evasion and circumvention. so i think the committee amendment is unwise and violates the definite policy of our country. and i think the amendment of the senator from minnesota and myself is infinitely to be preferred. for all these reasons. and also for the pragmatic reasons of producing more taxes for our country and aiding in the giving of encouragement to the less developed countries. i hope the senate will see the wisdom of our amendment. and will adopt it. tomorrow. i shall further buttress the arguments in favor of this amendment. by producing additional material. as submitted in the joint ecoic committee and elsewhere. i thank the senator from nebraska for his courtesy
the senator from nebraska is correct. and that adds to american investments in business. especially those of this character. it must be remembered that tax havens will be as definitely thwarted if the internal revenue service is able to exercise the powers provided by our amendment as they will be if it is able to take advantage of the purely mechanical features of this committee amendment. in other words the catching of the rascals will  be done more effectively by means of the committee amendment.
. it is my belief that the provisions contained in section 12 of the committee version of the tax bill would discourage the consideration of ecoic advantage as the basis for oversea investment decisions by u.s. business. as the result of the "escape clause" provisions. the discouragement of such considerations would affect most heavily new investors who had  yet built up an earning base overseas and would need to accumulate a larger amount of earnings for capital reinvestment. bluntly speaking. the effect of this section would be to cause the very thing which the administration is trying to avoid: it would make tax considerations paramount in investment decisions. further. it would do the opposite of what the administration claims for it: it would soon worsen our balanceofpayments situation and it would place u.s. businessesinvestors and exportersat a serious disadvantage in their competition with foreigners for a foreign ecoic base and for export markets. although it is freely conceded by the administration that the returns from our oversea investments exceed the annual outflow. i should like to refresh our memory and therefore ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the latest statistics. showing that from 1950 through 1961 dividend and interest income from our oversea investments exceeded the outflow of new capltal by a total of $8.6 billion. in 1962 alone. the difference came to $1.2 billion. these are u.s. department of commerce figures.
i think the senator from california is entitled to our thanks and appreciation for having worked out this solution. and i believe the senator from georgia is entitled to our appreciation for his willingness to accommodate himself to the obvious needs of the great metropolitan areas which  have this service. we were advisedalthough  the matter would be academicthat there was practically actual likelihood. because of the mechanics of preparing a line to get a certificate. and so forth. that any other line would be able to participate in these funds in the fiscal year 1963. but however that may be. and for whatever reason. it is etheless true that the opportunity is  to be available to the home metropolitan area of the senator from georgia . of which we are just as proud as any in the country. therefore. i think this is a fine solution. and i am very much obliged to the distinguished senator from california for working it out. madam president. in order to lay the whole matter before the senate. i ask unanimous consent that a telegram which i have received from the president of the new york airways. inc.-and i am sure the same telegram also went to my colleague and to all the rest of usmay be printed at this point in the record. so that the points and arguments may be seen.
state regulation is all important. i repeat to the senator that whatever we do on the tax bill. the institutions are functioning. and the situation which we face will  be made or unmade by the tax bill. what we can make or unmake is the extent of the competition in certain areas where they are put out of competition if the new definitions remain as they are.
. i believe the senator from oklahoma. who is a very eloquent man. has obviously let his eloquence run away with him. and has completely overlooked the facts. i should like to make clear what i am talking about in that regard. the senator says that if my amendment. in which the senator from minnesota joins. were adopted. certain corporations would be free from tax. that is  eorrect. they would  be free from tax. their tax status would be the same as it is .  as changed by the bill. but the same as it is . whenever they repatriated any capital. they would pay taxes to the united states. just as they are paying them .
i said when the capital was repatriated. we are talking only about american companies which have subsidiaries and sales corporations abroad. we are  talking about swiss companies. we can tax such companies unless they have a relationship to american companies. the senator had argued that under this amendment such corporations would be free of tax.
i am sorry. it would . because my amendment affects subsections (d) and (e). and then it would include material the senator read from page 189. i sought to exclude specifically holding companies subject to tax and holding company tax havens. that is precisely what is included. i understood the argument which would be made on the other side. i do  feel. in all fairness. that it ought to be made with respect to what i was trying to accomplishthe same opportunities for american companies which are going to be operating in this field. in accordance with the enlightened concepts of trying to compete on terms of equality with the british. the french. the germans. and all others who operate in those markets. the bill would very materially disadvantage such companies. that is the correction which the senator from minnesota and i. at the very last stages of the debate on the bill. are still trying to make. if we can. we can. but we still have the right to try. with all respect to the senator from oklahoma. i still do  believe we should be subjected to the charge that we are trying to maintain tax havens and tax avoiders when we have designed an amendment expressly to exclude the personal holding companies which are referred to on pages 188 and 189 of the bill. if the amendment included switzerland. the senate would be at perfect liberty to repeal this provision. but  we are talking only about the six common market countries and about american corporations seeking to operate there in the interests of our own export trade in competition with the companies which are  subjected to that which the bill will subject american companies in terms of their income from those operations. that is the fundamental point and the fundamental reason for our position. i do  feel. in all honesty and fairness. that our position justifies the general assertion that we are trying to sweep back into the bill tax havens and all the other things which are complained of.
i thank the senator from minnesota. i should like to conclude my remarks on this point. because. withstanding the importance of the tax sections. this point is more important than anything we have been discussing in the way of taxes. in connection with the trade bill. the fallacious argument will be made that foreign countries in the establishment of american manufacturing facilities somehow brings about the "exporting of jobs." i predict. that if that is the concept on which the senate will vote on the trade bill and other policy bills. american ecoic power and influence will atrophy. and american exports will diminish very materially. and we shall be unable to maintain our position in the world. such a concept reminds one of a general who. when confronted with an overwhelming force. goes about his defense by keeping all his troops in his castle. in such a situation. a sortie is essential. and a sortie is essential both in ecoics and in war. it is most important that there be widespread realization of the importance of the true concept in this connection. but. i say. with all respect. that the president has loosely used the concept of "exporting jobs by means of making american investments abroad." . based upon this concept of competition. i hope the senate will see fit to adopt the amendment.
 decided to bow to his committee chairman in the congress. i believe that it was a poor decision. but  he can act on his own. he can restore some element of ecoic confidence by letting us see. . the creative tax program he proposes to submit next year.
first. i think it would  have been quite right to allow the conference report to be agreed to without some analysis and discussion of it. a measure which involved many days of debate and exercised the business community of the country should certainly  go through the senate in 5 minutes. that was the purpose the senator from iowa sought to serve and which i sought to serve in interrupting the proceeding. i do  ask these questions with any hostile or adverse intent. i intend to support the conference report. however. i think it is important to pinpoint certain of the critical items in it. first. taking the items in series as reported by the conference. the senator from oklahoma said there will be a net gain in revenue by the enactment of the bill. will that gain be attributable to an excess from the closing of loopholes.
i thank the senator. i have two further questions to ask. one of them relates to the problem of controlled foreign corporations under american ownership. and the attempt to include a provision which would be such that american concerns would  thus find themselves at a disadvantage when competing with foreign corporations which would  come under the provisions imposed by this tax bill. of course it is impossible for me to deal with all the nuances of this matter. but we have great confidence in the senator from oklahoma. and therefore i wish to ask him this question: was the competitive situation of such american firms in competition with foreign firms reasonably taken into consideration in determining the tax base upon which the controlled foreign corporations should operate.
i happen to be one of those who believed that the reporting was superior to the withholding requirement. i thought the withholding requirement. considering our general situation. was  wise. but we are  considering the report. i have doubt it will be approved. i myself intend to support it. will the senator join with me in the suggestion that the treasury. at the same time it reports on revenue production. report on the way the reporting system is operating and the way it affects different segments of the thrift industry.
the senator from new york would like to observe to his dear friend and colleagueand he is. withstanding our differences upon this subjectthat all he was saying was that as a senator from new york he did  want to have less authority than a senator from aher sovereign state. the fact that my state pays onefifth of the taxes does  mean that the money is drawn in the greatest measure from the toil of others. in the first place. this fiction about new york being the money changers temple has long since been exploded. considering chicago. atlanta. tallahassee. jacksonville. and los angeleswhich. incidentally. is the seat of the biggest bank in the world. the bank of america.  new york. there are many centers. there are 17 million people in new york. they operate tractors. they work as hard as anybody else in this country. and they are 10 percent of the population. the senator from new york was only making clear that the constitution provides that there shall be two senators from every state. matter how small. matter how small the population. matter how small the productive power. but he does  want the two senators from small states grouping together. if that is their desire. to stop him. the senator from a big state. from voting on something which is in the interests of his state. according to the constitution. which provides that a majority shall control the legislation of the united states. merely because they stand upon the floor and decide to use the power of the filibuster. that is all i argue. with the greatest of respect. i flatly deny the charge that new york claims any special advantage or privilege. or any special standing. because of its size or the amount of taxes it pays. i do  believe that in this day and age the paraphrased cry of "hey. rube" is going to convince anybody. new york has as many rights in the senate as any other statemore and less. that is all the senator from new york was arguing.
. examine. if you will. the record of a series of votes taken on such issues as elimination of the poll tax in 1962 and the proposed extension of the life of the civil rights commission. in 1961. and the civil rights billsweak and meager though they werein 1957 and 1960. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record. in. connection with my remarks. a table on this subject. it shows the constant assault on such measures and their constant defeat by means of motions to lay on the table. why has that happened. it has happened because of the threat to engage in a filibusterfor example. the threat to engage in a filibuster unless part iii was deleted. or unless further attention was paid to placing a statutory base under the committee on equal employment opportunity under government contracts.
. in robert kerr many of us in the senate met a powerful figure. physically and intellectually. when we were on opposite sides of an issue. he was a formidable adversary. but when we were on the same side. he was an equally formidable ally. new york state owes him a great debt of gratitude for his role as architect of the niagara power project. robert moses und i had discussed plans to invite bob kerr to tour the niagara power project later this year. and with senator kerrs approval. we were going to have a "robert kerr day" in which the niagara community would participate. we in new york regret that bob kerr did  live to have a firsthand look at that project in operation. as he would have been proud of the role he played in having it developed. robert kerr was indeed one of the alltime giants of the senate.
. i join with a number of my colleagues in the protests directed at the removal of the regional office of the internal revenue service from new york to boston. i think it is quite fitting that the secretary of the treasury should have annced today that he intends to review that question. new york is the biggest taxpaying unit in the united states. it is inconceivable that removal to boston of a regional office can be justified. the move is  justified by the fact that data processing equipment exists at lawrence mass.. because there are regional offices in other parts of the *country which are  located near data processing equipment of the irs. i have asked today that the treasury department afford us an open hearing. i think the matter is important and critical to warrant it. secretary dillons anncement that he will review this proposal to reorganize a number of internal revenue service offices is most welcome. i predict that if mr. dillon conducts a thorough review. even to the extent of granting a public hearingto hear the views of public officials. community leaders. bar associations. tax practitioners. and taxpayersthe result will be that the regional tax office will remain in new york city. where it has been since regional offices were established by the internal revenue service in 1952. and where it belongs.
i can accept that statement. i am sorry. i was here and heard challenged the indication by senator ervin last year that he granted a hearing on any civil rights bill when requested to do so. a request was made by my colleague from new york . i do  wish to embarrass the senator from new york. because he is a member of the subcommittee. i shall  ask him any questions. i will state of my own kledge that this question was challenged. various senators. including the senator from new york. are sponsors of a half a dozen bills which were referred to this very subcommittee. bills upon which hearings have been held. it simply taxes my credibilityi speak personallyto assume that request was made for hearings on the most obvious civil rights bill before the subcommittee. where all that was necessary. according to what has been said. was to ask for hearings and hearings would be granted. i simply think that that would * really be impugning the good faith of so many of us who have introduced civil rights bills. it is simply inconceivable to me. this is the only chance we will have to take action of this kind. so i have offered a most mild amendment. it would open up the procedure to provide the very thing which the senator from nebraska says took place. in the absence of the chairman of the subcommittee to give us that assurance. and the unwillingness to put this resolution over for 2 or 3 days. as was done in the case of aher subcommittee resolution. just for that purpose alone i wish to get his assurance. . i do  think that is the way senators should act with each other. and if for other reason. we should vote on this matter tonight. on the record. let us test that out and find out why this particular resolution must be singled out tonight. and must be voted on tonight. and can be put over until tuesday. why  put it over. in the absence of the subcommittee chairman. i think this demands a record vote.
 can wield in ecoic matters. and added: to insure that the revised balance will promote freedom. as well as responsibility. immediate steps should be taken to improve machinery for the cooperation of industry. labor and the government. i believe the national productivity council should be a major objective in the drive to accelerate the productivity of our nations ecoic plant. i ask unanimous consent that the bill may be printed at the conclusion of my remarks. and may lie on the desk until the close of business tomorrow for the purpose of enabling other senators who wish to do so to add their names as cosponsors.
these amendments relate to the extension service and the farmers home administration. which are part of the department of agriculture. i think they go directly to the point recently made by the u.s. civil rights commission about discriminatory use of federal funds. the federal government is subsidizing segregation and discrimination in many of the programs in which it is providing the money derived from taxes on all citizens. in the programs relating to the extension service and the farmers home administration that fact is so clear. as i shall demonstrate with evidence on tuesday. that limitations against segregation and discrimination are absolutely demanded. that is what i intend to propose. i think that these proposals are eminently deserving. . i have laid down a principle for myself that i shall follow where its application is clear. i have desire to spread a wide net in connection with this subject. however. where the evidence is clear. as it is in these two cases. i consider it my duty to ask the senate to act. fortified. as i am. by the recommendation of the u.s. civil rights commission regarding discriminatory use of federal funds. it is a crying shame. considering the situation we face in connection with civil rights. that we should countenance the expenditure of federal funds to subsidize segregation and discrimination in the programs in which federal funds are needed.
. an amendment which would provide in that part of the bill which relates to appropriations for the internal revenue service that the money appropriated may  be used to move the new york regional office to boston or make other moves contemplated in the socalled reorganization annced by the internal revenue service would be in order. i have decided that it would be inappropriate to submit such an amendment. i should like to state my reasons to the senate. first. i believe that wherever possible such decisions should be made on a business and administrative basis in the best interests of governmental service and service to the public. i am much indebted to the committee on finance. which held a special hearing on this subject in executive session on april 5. and then released the transcript of the hearing on april 11. 1963. for its time and work on that subject. in my opinion. and i believe in the opinion of many others. the transcript shows so irrefutably that to make moves such as those contemplated and. in particular to put through the proposed change of the regional office from new york to boston. would be so much against the public interest and would  really accomplish in any material way any of the things claimed for it. that we are better advised to rely upon that record. it is a very strong record. we are better advised to rely upon the approach to the question taken by the senate finance committee. which should be very g.ratifying to every government agencyi. because the decision proceeds from a business and public interest point of view. and does  attempt to approach the question on the floor of the senate. as i could do if i offered the amendment. what i have said does  mean that it can be done in this way in every case.  does it necessarily mean that the amendment would carry. i am speaking on a question of principle. the principle is that in a case in which a major committee of the senate interests itself egh in a situation of this character to hold a hearing on it. and where the case made is. in my view and. as i have said. in the view of many others. so strong as to dictate a lack of wisdom in the proposed reorganization. it would be very interesting to see whether the proper response would be forthcoming from the internal revenue service without the need for exercising the congressional power in respect to appropriations. i think this would be a far more statesmanlike approach by all concerned. all of the main points which were relied upon in respect of the reorganization fell upon analysis and upon debate. what i have said is  necessarily any complaint against the internal revenue service. other facts which were developed by reason of the anncement and the preliminary discussions which preceded it indicated that the proposed change would be very unwise. that evidence was contributed to by the legal profession of new york. the taxpayers of new york. and. very importantly. in the debate and discussion which took place at the hearing before the committee on finance. at that hearing i submitted certain statements and questions through the senator from nebraska . who graciously answered them. my colleague was present. about a week ago my colleague made a magnificent speech in the senate. analyzing in the greatest detail the reasons why the contemplated move should  be made. i ask unanimous consent that there may be printed at this point in the rzcord an analysis of the statements made in favor of the move and of the reorganization which i described. and the answers. literally. from the commissioner himself as the situation was developed before the committee. which strike down the argument that the regional office needs to be near the service center. which is located at lawrence. mass. on the contrary. apparently that is  the practice  is it particularly dictated in respect of this subject.
. i send to the desk. for appropriate reference. a concurrent resolution calling for congressional study of the potentialities of broadening profit sharing. including stockownership. a comprehensive survey of this important field was last made in 1939. pursuant to senate resolution 215 of the 75th congress. by a vandenberg subcommittee of the finance committee. which in its report (s. rept. 610. 76th cong.) concluded that profit sharing is "essential to the ultimate maintenance of the capitalistic system." the passage of 24 years. with the intervening emous changes in our social and ecoic environments. makes vitally necessary an updating of that report and reconsideration of the alternative incentive techniques  available. the subcommittee then found. for example. that there was consensus as to the use of incentive tax exemptions and rewards to encourage profit sharing. since then the use of incentive tax devices has become so well accepted that cix566 their applicability to profit sharing deserves thorough reappraisal. the fact that in the interim existing law on restricted stock options has generally  served as a stimulus to stockholding beyond the executive and salaried employee level would be a subject of importance for the committee to study. the concurrent resolution provides for an updating of the vandenberg subcommittee report by the joint ecoic committee of congress or by a subcommittee of that committee. the joint ecoic committee was created by the full employment act of 1946 specifically to make continuing studies of matters relating to the national ecoic policy. including employment. production. and purchasing power. in my view. such a study as thisaffecting one of the most crucial aspects of our nations ecoyshould be given the kind of high priority which the administration has given to the tax cut.
at the same time i am pleased to join today in the introduction of senator kefauvers bill. which would establish an office of consumers as an independent agency in the executive branch to act as a clearinghouse for consumer information and complaints and to represent consumer interests in cases pending before federal regulatory agencies and in the federal courts. for many years the key symbol in our private enterprise society has been the consumer.  he is even more crucial. since the focus of the administrations domestic ecoic policy today is on the need for a tax cut. for the express purpose of stimulating consumer spending. my position is and has been that the tax cut alone is  sufficient. and that action must be taken on a combination of measures as follows: to deal affirmatively with revision of the antitrust laws. with automations effects on the worker. with profltsharing. with export expansion. and with emergency strike procedures. but the reduction of tax rates for individualsconsumersis an important part of such a program. yet the administration. in pressing for the tax cut on the ground of increased consumer spending. has done little or hing to ascertain. either itself or through the congress. the underlying reasons which motivate consumers attitudes toward their personal finances and whether a tax cut as suggested will actually trigger their rate of spending. i believe the congress in this connection must consider most carefully the factors with relation to the buying habits of 180 million people which have a critically important effect on the ecoy and. in turn. upon the ecoic measures with which the congress must deal. for these and other reasons i will explain i have introduced senate resolution 116. which would establish a select committee on consumers in the senate. a 17member bipartisan committee which would study and investigate ecoic problems of direct concern to u.s. consumers. determine the effectiveness of existing federal agencies in dealing with consumer problems and recommend what if any additional legislation might be needed to safeguard. protect. and advance consumer interests generally. the committee would be patterned upon the select small business committee. which serves the same function in relation to the small business community. i believe senate resolution 116 and the bill being introduced today by the senator from tennessee together would remedy the very serious gap which  exists in both the congress and the executive branch. every committee of the congress deals almost daily with matters which have an impact upon consumers or. like the tax cut. are based upon predictions of consumer behavior. yet there is one body in the congress which is charged with responsibility specifically for studying the factors affecting consumer interests. similarly. the executive branch. through such agencies as the departments of labor. agriculture. commerce. and health. education. and welfare. including the food and drug administration. gives systematic consideration to about 28 million americans17 million union members. 2.1 million farmowners. 2.3 million wholesale and retail proprietors. and over 6.7 million more private proprietors of businesses and industriesin their capacity as producers. however. there is systematic representation of consumers interests in overall ecoic policy as formulated by the federal government. in july 1962 president kennedy appointed a consumers advisory council. a group to advise the presidents council of ecoic advisers. but the pro forma nature of this group has been evident since its establishment. it has only a derivative and parttime role and is wholly without authority. it can play the needed meaningful role for consumers even in the executive branch and it can be of little help to the congress. senate resolution 116 and the measure being introduced today by the senator from tennessee are needed more than ever. so i express my appreciation to the senator for his cooperation in this field. and assure him that we welcome his support in this effort. which represents an element of the total structure to which he is addressing himself today and which at long last will be recognized as the critical base of american society and the american ecoic system. i thank the senator.
i am very grateful to my colleague for his observations which are constructive and helpful. my colleague has emphasized what needs to be emphasized. we shall  only sacrifice time and our personal disposition to be with our families. but also we shall sacrifice perhaps some very pet measuresperhaps even measures urgently needed by the country. but it seems to me the senator is entirely correct in saying that the civil rights measures must have  1 priority. the president. as i read his message. has dedicated  only his head. but his heart. he is also dedicating his top priority program. displacing tax reduction. he has made that issue second. making civil rights first. again i express my gratitude to the senator for his statement
 let me pay my respects for the magnificent job done in connection with the first step of putting a solid platform under this great effort. which has been participated in so effectively by the distinguished deputy majority leader. the senator from minnesota . and the distinguished deputy miity leader. the senator from california . i am deeply gratified. and it is one of the finest jobs i have seen done in this bipartisan area. in which i. myself. have been active so long. i think i k a good job when i see one. and this was extremely well done. so i thank the senator.
. the u.s. balanceofpayments situation is one of the most critical problems facing this country today. the subject is hotly debated among businessmen. bankers and within the government. it has been the subject of congressional scrutiny and will be so again in hearings before the joint ecoic committee on july 8 and 9. yet up to  the main results of the debate and investigation have been measures which. rather than meeting this problem head on. obscure fundamental. structural weaknesses in the u.s. balance of payments. the fact is that we are  meeting our balanceofpayments problem and that the meastres we are taking are insufficient to the need and will continue to prove to be insufficient. while the us. balanceofpayments deficit has declined between 1961 and 1962 from $2.4 billion to $2.2 billion. during the first quarter of this year the deficit was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.3 billion. on may 15. in an attempt to take a new measure of our governments thinking on the payments deficit situation. i wrote identical letters to secretary dillon and secretary rusk requesting their comment on six questions based on questions raised by armand erpf of carl m. loeb. rhoades & co. at the april 22 dinner of the ecoic club of new york. i have  received both of their replies which i believe will be of great interest to my colleagues. i. therefore. ask unanimous consent that my letter of may 15 together with their responses of may 28 and june 7 be printed in the record at this point of my remarks.
my answer to the senator is distinctly "yes." i agree with the senator. as we stand . it would be a mistake to take domestic austerity measures in that order of magnitude. because we still have room for maneuver. i shall develop the ideaand i hope the senator will join me in developing it as we go alongthat the real danger we face is that if we tarry at this point. when we still have room for maneuver. we will be "up against the gun" very soon. the secretary of the treasury has said we would be in that position in 1 or 2 years. perhaps we shall be there even sooner. once we are. we shall have choice. we shall have to take drastic austerity measures. which will have an impact upon employment as well as savings and the ecoic activity in this country of the most deleterious character and in a most regretable way. we shall then be left with choice. and we shall have been deprived of the room for maneuver. in my opinion. this is about the last opportunity that we shall have.
the question of the senator from wisconsin is a tribute to his erudition and skill in this field. i am delighted that he has chosen to question me this aftern. the senator has stated the classic proposal which is involved. i speak for myself. on the basis of a thoughtful consideration of the problem and perhaps as much study and understanding of the facts as any senator can claim. i have lived with the problem for many years. even before i became a representative or a senator. i feel that there is a real difference in timing. we must be cautious and hardheaded about expenditures. but i do  believe that as yet we are deprived of the freedom of maneuver which will make it unnecessary. if we use our time. to go in for the retrenchment and the austerity to which the senator has referred. at the moment i still thinkperhaps it is the last momentand there i would certainly consider with the greatest respect the senators viewwe have time to go either way. the classic way of dealing with the situation which i am describing is austerity. there is question about that. nations have made a great success of it. we saw the virtue of the standstill on wage increases in germany and the german miracle which erhardt performed. which was heavily attributable to the fact that workmen tightened their belts. and let productivity charge forward without increasing materially their wages and salaries. that was an example of austerity. the same thing occurred in japan. where an ecoic miracle was also performed. those nations were virtually destroyed in war. and had a much longer road to travel than that. we have a powerful and effective productive machine. a vast credit structure. and the confidence of most nations throughout the world. we have many assets. we still have time to utilize all of our productive resources to stimulate our ecoy. provide investment. capital. credit and often types of assistance to accelerate the development of the underdeveloped areas of the free world. with an enlargement of the worlds credit base. we are resilient egh and strong egh. and we still have egh "muscle" to do all of that and to deal with our problem by moving forward. we are  as yet reduced to the only alternative of austerity as a way to solve this problem. but our days are numbered. it may  be very many days or weeks or months before much against my will and unhappily. i shall have to join the senator in the feeling that the opportunity is gone. because the situation is approaching that point. i still say that. with the measures which i shall be describing. with which the senator is thoroughly familiar. we can go forwardto use the words of the presidentthough he has  done so. i still think we can deal with this problem and at the same time develop our country and discharge our obligations and responsibilities in the world more effectively. more successfully. and more decisively in the cold war. the problem with regard to the austerity approach. which i think everybody would fear. including the senator from wisconsin. is. though it might save us. how much would be thrown overboard in the process. how many countries or how many continents would be left to communism.
i thank the senator from wisconsin. i was about to complete the point in regard to inflation. the senator made that point. i think it is a valid point. except for the fact that there is a tremendous underutilization. both of our productive and our human resources. with 5 million people unemployed and 30 percent of our american industrial plant underutilized. the figure of 30 percent is  entirely valid. because much of it is obsolescent. however. a good deal of it is  obsolescent. with all these underutilized resources. we have an opportunity. if we retain a freedom of maneuvering. to move forward in the direction of fuller utilization of our resources. rather than retrenching at this point. we will  run into the danger of inflation as a result of a tax cut so long as such a serious underemployment and underutilization of our resources continues.
fifth. congress should carefully examine the balanceofpayments implications of the unrestricted flotation of new foreign security issues in the united states. let us remember that these resulted in a longterm capital outflow of half a billion dollars in the first quarter of this year alone. most of usand i am includedare opposed .to placing direct controls on capital flows. whether it involves u.s. investment abroad or the sale of foreign securities in the united states. i believe. however. that serious thought should be given by congress to placing a condition on the right of foreign firms or governments to borrow in u.s. capital markets or float new security issues here. namely. that a substantial proportion of the funds obtained here should be spent on u.s. goods and services for the duration of our u.s. balanceofpayments crisis. there should be an opportunity to make exceptions in that regard. of course. nevertheless. a consideration of that policy could be very helpful at the present time. sixth. the question of higher shortterm interest rates and their effect upon u.s. ecoic growth and capital flows to and from the united states should become the subject of a careful study by congress. there are wide differences of opinion. on this question within the private sector and in government circles. some suggest that higher shortterm interest rates would do little harm to the domestic ecoy.. and might greatly help in the payments problem. both by attracting direct shortterm capital to the united states and by making it less attractive for foreigners to borrow. on the other hand. both the state department and the treasury department. in their replies to my questions on our * balanceofpayments situation. which i placed in the record of june 20. 1963. state that other factors. such as the capacity of u.s. capital markets to accommodate large borrowings and the relative backwardness of european and japanese capital markets. are decisive in the decision of foreigners to borrow here. even at higher interest rate levels. i understand that even a fractional difference of perhaps onehalf of 1 percent in the shortterm interest rate would make a difference in attracting capital here. i e with satisfaction that this is one of the urgent items that is being given consideration by the administration.
the history of the situation appears to be that it will  deter business activity. however. i favor the general proposition of interest rates being lowered all the time. as the se* curity and stability of our country improves and increases. the cost of money ought to be less. it has always been an onerous burden to require people to pay an excessive interest rate as the cost of money. so i favor lower interest rates over the long term. but i wish to point out that. faced with the choice of many alternatives. such as a sharp austerity program in the united states. if we really were confronted with a dire situation with respect to balance of payments. i would certainly prefer some fractional increase in the interest rate. especially on a shortterm basis. for it would attract capital here. the best opinion which i have from the banking communityand i think it is a very reliable oneis that this proposal would have effect whatever upon personal credit rates. which are at higherthantime rates for money and for mortgages. incidentally. interest rates on mortgages are  very low. and will  be affected materially by what we are talking about in terms of the kind of interest rate which would attract capital back to the united states. therefore. my answer is that under the present alternatives available to us. certainly this is far more desirable and a far less harmful alternative than some of the alternatives to which we may be pressed if the situation is allowed to deteriorate further.
i agree. the senator from wisconsin may remember the very dark days when britain was being blitzed. and before we got into the war. when churchill performed what i consider to be one of the most brilliant acts of his careernamely. when he sent either one or two motorized divisions into th africa. withstanding the fact that britain was then so heavily beleaguered and that we were  then in the war. such a division of forces is always very risky. but the imaginative decisions of mankind are often made on that basis. i think there is a considerable analogy between that kind of thinking and our present situation in international terms. the tax cut represents that kind of boldness. but once we undertake a bolder policy. we can do so haltingly. we must do everything which that policy requires. in that respect i agree with the senator that if we are to favor the tax cutand i believe we shouldwe must sut it with a program which is as imaginative as the idea of a tax cut itself.
s proposalthe interest equalization tax on foreign securities. one is that e can be certain that the proposed tax will reduce our payments deficit caused by longterm capital outflows. the second is that should the tax be effective it may cause a substantial reduction in the worlds liquidity. which is provided by the dollars we are channeling abroad. if deflationary pressures would develop as a result. mr. lippmann states "there will be needed big reforms in the international monetary system." on july 10 i introduced a resolution calling for such reforms to be carried out through a world monetary conference. mr. lippmann is correct in criticizing the treasurys attitude that consideration of reform of the world monetary system should come only after our balanceofpayments deficit has been substantially reduced or eliminated. the treasurys reasoning is that serious consideration of such a proposal would indicate weakness and thereby shake confidence in the dollar. this line of reasoning is fallacious. we are  dealing with our balanceofpayments deficit from weakness--far from it. the strength of the dollar. the question of confidence in the dollar. must be measured against the great strength of our industrial machine. the emous size of our overseas investments. the size of our foreign trade and our great military strength. i do  believe that the measures taken thus far by the administration recognizes this basic strength or that these can meet this critical problem effectively. while i agree that we must in the first -instance take all necessary steps that can be taken in the sphere of domestic ecoic policywithout jeopardizing our ecoic growththe resolution of our balanceofpayments problem in the  so distant future must be dealt with within the framework of basic reforms in the worlds monetary mechanism. rather than to pursue this discussion in an extemporaneous manner . i wish to deal with it once again in detail next monday on the floor of the senate. i hope that interested colleagues will participate in this discussion. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the congressional record at this point.
. i am grateful to the senator from wisconsin. we have done this once before. but hing much happened except that the balanceofpayments deficit climbed at the rate of almost $2 billion. the senator from wisconsin is eminently well qualified to make a major contribution in the consideration of what should be done. i hope he will join me thursday. i ask unanimous consent. by way of signalizing that this is  merely our opinion. to have printed in the record an editorial entitled "battle of the dollar." from the new york times of this morning.
i should like to get the figures clear on this point. i can give the senator the exact figures. because i am well aware of the situation. the total tourist expenditures of u.s. tourists abroad in 1962 was $212 billion. the deficit in 1962 was $1.400 million. in 1963. it is expected to be $1.600 million. there has been an improvement with respect to receipts from those who visit us from abroad. in the sense that those. expenditures have moved up from something in the neighborhood of $900 million in 1960 to approximately $1.050 million in 1962. further improvement is contemplated as a result of the worlds fair in new york in 1964. and the productivity of our tourist promotion efforts. however. we are certainly  doing for the u.s. travel service what we should. the dollars that they spend for promotion are paid back many times over. i have often thought of advocating the idea of giving the agency a percentage of the improvement that is brought about. in terms of dollars to be spent for promotion. the fact is that the tourist problem. as the senator has pointed out. is very critical. and represents about a $3 billion outflow. which we have been suffering for almost 10 years. that is figuring half of what has been pretty much accepted as our mal imbalance of payments.
. how can the existing system be modified. the international gold standard worked reasonably well in pre1932 depression days. largely because of the ability of the bank of england to make it work and also because of the fact that the pre1914 world was much less complicated than the one in which we find ourselves today. in those days there was much greater flexibility in the domestic ecoies of the western countries. and deficits among them were automatically settled through equilibrating shortterm capital movements and gold flows.. but today neither the united states  any other country is willing to allow its ecoy to be subjected to inflation or depression as a result of forces operating in other countries. dominant in the minds of most people and of their governments is the concept of full employment. the achievement of a prosperous national ecoy which takes priority everywhere over the desirability of reestablishing a world ecoy along the lines that existed prior to 1914. some conservative ecoists and bankers insist that the united states should try to convince other countries to follow. and also should follow itself. policies which would completely subject domestic ecoic policies to the discipline of the balance of payments. and that we should return to an automatic international payments mechanism under some form of a gold standard matter what the domestic ecoic consequences. there are growing indications that the willingness of our european creditors to hold additional dollars as reserves is diminishing. the inadequacy of new gold production to provide adequate additions to world reserves is widely recognized. it is therefore quite evident that the proposals that have been circulating for the fast few years including those of triffin. bernstein. stamp. maudling. and most recently of the authors of the brookings study for world monetary reform. should be carefully evaluated. an additional proposal for the evolutionary change of the present international monetary system put forth by central bankers of germany. italy. and switzerland and senior officers of the federal reserve bank in the latest monthly review of the federal reserve bank of new york. while extremely modest. indicates that they too question the adequacy of the existing mechanism upon which the worlds whole monetary credit structure rests. cix- 1023 my assistant.  of the council of ecoic advisers. made before the house committee on banking and currency on july 25. 1963. a clear indication that he. too. is deeply troubled by the inadequacy of the pace of expansion of international credit and the existing monetary system of the world. i ask unanimous consent that pages 31 to 35 of mr. hellers prepared statement referring to the longrun evolution of the international monetary system may be printed at this point in my remarks.
as the senator from wisconsin explained it. my proposal sounded better than when i made it. my reason is that it would  necessarily restrict the flow of dollars. it might increase the flow of dollars. provided they were dollars which. when utilized to buy foreign securities. were used in our national interest. let me give some practical examples. for a long time we untied our foreign aidthe senator from wisconsin is familiar with itand it was almost a doctrine of the treasury and the state department. we were setting the fashion in the world by absolutely untied foreign aid. and were saying that. academically. this was the right way to give aid. so the country and the person aided could have the entire range of international competition in order to use the aid to the greatest effect. we found that that theory did  work. it was hurting us. we were put in the position where we had either to cut off aid or place some restrictions on it. with respect to the capital issues. we are somewhat in the same position. we are still laboring under the same academic illusion that the interest equalization tax is the better way. because it leaves those involved free to raise money and spend it as they will. i do  think we can afford that luxury at this moment. with the imbalance of payments which we have and with the restrictions on our international business. it would be more to our national interest that there should be security flotation in this country. that is a more effective measure to apply. the major flaw in the argument of the senator from wisconsin is that this is  a time when we are free to indulge in a classic demonstration of ecoic liberalisma time when we are suffering a deficit at the annual rate of $5.2 billion in our balance of payments. the question is. what do we do about it. do we cut off military or foreign aid. of course . that is very clear. do we restrict our tourists to $500 a year for expenditures.  we will  do that if we can avoid it. do we do other things. do we try to attract all the money in the world to the united states. on a temporary basis. by raising our rediscount rate.  to 31/2 percent. but to 5 percent. the british raised it to 7 percent.  if we did that. we would probably have 8 million unemployed. unemployment is dangerous egh . i ask unanimous consent that a wall street journal article of august 27. 1963. by alfred malabre. describing the disastrous domestic ecoic consequences of britains efforts to correct its balanceofpayments deficit problem through higher interest rates in 1957 and 1960 be printed in the record at this point.

[as their names were read. the distinguished visitors rose in their places and were greeted with applause.]
that language raises a question. of course. i k that e of the guard units is  up to that strength. they are far from it. etheless. there is a question which they are asking us as to whether the words "attain an end strength" mean that the 400.000 figure is a continuing ceiling throughout the fiscal year. or whether it means that at the end of the fiscal year 1964 they must have more than an end strength of 400.000. the difference is in the dynamics in which these questions operate. they may be overstrengthened temporarily in the course of a year. they may be understrengthened. the question is whether the test applies throughout the fiscal year or whether the words of art-"attain an end strength"-which seem to me very clear mean that under the fiscal year they shall have attained a strength greater than the ceiling.
. this is the position for which i have been contending all along. there are two principles in this respect which are crystal clear to me. one is that the civil rights bill must take precedence over the tax bill. because the civil rights bill is an answer to a problem of the gravest importance to domestic tranquility of the country. as a review of any daily newspaper will show. with children dying and people being arrested by the hundreds. indeed. by the thousands. becauseit seems to me this is at least one of the great causes--we have  made our contribution to trying to resolve this controversy in the courts and in law. secondly. we should pick up the commerce committee bill and start the debate and let the house bill come in when ready. this would curtail the debating process. in my view. by at least 4 weeks. because a great deal of debate must take place before senators get to the point of voting for cloture. the news report states that the majority leader does  agree. and still sticks to his view that the senate should take up the civil rights question when the house bill comes along. i respectfully disagree.
to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate agrees to the report of the committee.of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the amendments of the senate to the bill entitled "an act making appropriations for the department of defense for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1964. and for other purposes.
 that this is the better course. one other point before i close: an interestequalization tax can always be passed. it is much more desirable to try the capital issues committee alternative first. because it has every chance of working. if it does  work. we can always go to taxes
i am hoed to join with the senator from kentucky in his amendment. i believe it is constructive and can only help what should be the fundamental objectives of our nation in respect to these programs. i should like to testify to the senators sense of reasonableness and responsibility in changing section 263 of his amendment so that the prohibition would apply after the fiscal year 1965.
. i join my colleagues in the senate in expressing appreciation to the senator from connecticut for sponsoring the basic bill. and for campaigning for its enactment. i shall be glad to join in sponsoring the tax amendment. as will other senators also. this is extremely constructive proposed legislation. i have had occasion to work closely with the senator from maine. sometimes he has been with me. and sometimes he has been against me. but always he has worked most creditably and always has made a very fine contribution to this body. my old friend. caleb bo6gs. is a constant source of joy and pleasure. and has always been. as i have seen him come along through the house of representatives. as gover of his state. and  in .this present august position. he has always given to the people of our nation a lumis mind and understanding. i shall conclude my remarks in a moment. i call attention to subsection 4(b) of the bill. and the fact that it provides three criteria upon .which grants under the bill shall be made. first. there is population. second. the extent of the actual or potential air pollution problem .- and. third. the financial need of the respective agencies. rather than trying to do anything further with the bill by way of amendment. as this is essentially a matter of administration. i should like to ask the senator. in charge of the bill on the floor this question. so that the legislative history may be clear. with respect to subsection 4(b) of s. 432. is it  the committees intention. in considering the three factors to which due consideration shall be given in establishing regulations for the granting of funds. that the secretary shall place primary emphasis on "the extent .of the actual or potential air pollution problem."
i am grateful to the senator. this was one of the hardest fought conferences that i have ever participated in. or have seen. it would be most unfair to conclude action without paying tribute to my beloved colleague . who carried it through  only with consummate skill. but often against his convictions. in order to bring about results. the people of the country owe him a great debt in that regard. the senator from vermont . who joined us in conference. did great good. there were times when he had to subordinate his deep convictions in order to arrive at a result. which was accomplished both on the senate side and the house side.
. i have spoken repeatedly on this problem during the past few months. i want to reiterate my firm belief that the interest equalization tax is  in our own best interest. a capital issues committee. a measure that i support. even though it represents a measure of control over capital flows. is necessitated by the seriousness of the situation confronting the united states as a result of our continued balanceofpayments deficit. it is a measure which would be effective. flexible and truly temporary. i also ask unanimous consent that an article from the new york times of december 10 entitled. "roosa defends foreign securities tax plan and assails wall street executives who oppose it" be printed in the record.
i realize that a relatively small sum is involved. actually. it is substantial. but it is relatively small. the senator will recall that the use of the appropriated $650.000 as reflected in the committee report was for the payment of interest on the debt owed the treasury. the added $100.000 would. i assume. therefore. be available. small as it is. for the general purposes of carrying out the program.
. on behalf of myself and senators beall. bennett. and keating. i send to the desk an amendment to h.r. 8363. the pending tax rate reduction bill. which would repeal the 10percent federal excise tax on tickets to live dramatic and musical performances. the amendment achieves the same purpose as a bill which i have introduced in the senate over a period of years and which has been introduced in the house of representatives by congressman john lindsay. it is similar to an amendment introduced in the senate finance committee last week by senator fulbright which was at first accepted by the committee and later dropped along with the other excise tax repeal amendments. the excise tax on commercial theater tickets hampers very materially the development and growth of the live theater in the united states. the finance committee apparently understood and sympathized with this until the administration made it kn that it opposed the repeal of any excise taxes. the amendment would add to section 4233(a) of the internal revenue code of 1954. relating to exemptions from the tax on admissiors. the following new paragraph: (12) live dramatic or musical performances.-tax shall be imposed under section 4231 in respect of any admission to a live dramatic or musical performance presented in a theater. or presented in any other place if the presentation of such performance is the principal activity being conducted in such place at the time of such admission.
. after the vote is taken. i hope to address myself to the general policies of the bill and what it will and will  do ecoicallya matter to which i have given great consideration. i should like to take a moment on this amendment. i shall vote "yea" on the committee amendment. because we are at the crossroads with respect to the tax bill. i agree with much of what my friend the senator from kentucky has said. as we look at the area of experience. reducing the capital gains rate might conceivably result in loosening up a great many sales which have  been made. and stimulate the loosening of profits which are  unrealized. and perhaps there would be a greater tax net. it is significant that in the united kingdom there is capital gains tax. for those reasons. i think we are at the crossroads on the bill. when we are to take one road or the other. either we are going to provide for revenue loss and speculate that people will pay back far more than what it costs us in revenue. in the development of the ecoy. or we must use the bill as the tool with which to change the tax law in ways which are socially and ecoically more desirable. i am sure we shall  change the rate structure and that the tax loss of roughly $111/2 billion will stand. i find it very difficult to vote for further erosions of revenue. there may be items hidden here and there which represent serious problems of a rather individual nature which ought to receive consideration in connection with a tax bill. i shall make such a proposal in trying to do away with the 10 percent tax on theater tickets. for reasons different than the question of revenue. which amounts to only $5 million. there is some desire to take off the tax on handbags. which is the only item of womens apparel on which an excise tax is imposed. it is a tax on an item of necessity. i shall vote affirmatively on some of these matters. but when we reach the question of big reductions in revenues. we must take our choice between the plan as it has been laid out. and whittling away further. in a major way. very large amounts of revenues which under this bill will be invested in terms of ecoic recovery. therefore. while i feel it desirable to reform the capital gains provision. if we did it  we would be running a risk that was unjustified unless at the same time we felt free to revise the rate reductions which are made for individuals and corporations in the bill. i do  want to do that. i want to support the bill as an ecoically constructive move forward. it is for that reason that i shall vote for the amendment. rather than for the reason that i am satisfied with the capital gains provision. i am dissatisfied with it. i think it is exactly the kind of thing that should be reformed. but then we would start further major erosions of revenues. rather than provide relief. and there is  room for scaling down further the revenues as provided by the bill.
. the tax cut will  cure endemic unemployment. it will  win the war on poverty. it will  insure us against a recession or a depression. it will help. i deprecate the fact that the administration. every time we ask. "what are you going to do about unemployment. what are you going to do about poverty. what are you going to do about trying to lengthen out the present 35monthold ecoic expansion." says. "we are proposing a tax cut." this seems to be the only thinking in the administration upon the american ecoy. i k that the tax cut alone is inadequate. i k i must vote for it. it will help. it is the only thing. apparently. upon which the administration is willing to give us support. so. let us do it. it will  cure the defects in the ecoy with which we contend.
i wish to finish my remarks upon the bill and bear upon the colloquy with the distinguished senator from oregon on the subject of what the tax cut will or will  accomplish. i never like to leave a thought unfinished. if i can avoid doing so. some of the things that are needed in respect to the fundamental problems of our ecoy. quite apart from and in addition to a tax cuti can hope to name all of them. but i can cite someare: first. we are losing an estimated 40.000plus jobs a week because of automation. that is. the jobs need to be changed. and people need to be retrained and moved or removed to other sections of the country. it may be necessary to await a point of training in the use of new machines and the servicing of them. the fact that workers will go into service businesses more than they do in production lines. as automation takes over. may have an effect. this may require a period of transition of 1. 2. 3. or perhaps as much as 5 years. the transition may have to be helped with financing by the government. that would be a very direct and immediate way in which to deal with a large volume of unemployment. the maximum number of personnel scheduled for retraining under the manpower retraining programs will be 135.000 in fiscal year 1964. that compares with estimates of up to 1 million persons a year who will need retraining. that is one thing that should be done. aher thing that needs to be done is to stimulate exports. it is true that we  have an export surplus of about $5 billion. yet we are running a very serious imbalance in our international payments. withstanding some shakeout of foreign financing in this country by the threatened interest equalization tax bill that is  pending in the other body. there is still an imbalance in the area of about $3 billion a year. exports can deal with that. in addition. exports could do much more for the american ecoic system and employment. other countries encourage exports of their products by providing special tax treatment for additional exports. we ought to do the same thing. the investment of american capital abroad by american firms is also inhibited by the antitrust laws. . but i do so without having any illusions about its value and also without having any illusions that we shall be able to keep it absolutely clear of any other tax change. because provisions of that sort are already included in it. i hope very much that the prouty amendment will be agreed to.
the senator from wisconsin has stated the facts in regard to action by the federal power commission on this tax credit and in regard to the question of passing the credit through. and he has also discussed the situation in the case of the interstate commerce commission. does he have other examples to cite.
i thank the senator from delaware. because everyone ks that i am devoted to the struggle to have the private enterprise system really do its proper job in the world. i think the question before the tax collector is always how he can do his job without drawing blood. so in deciding whether this rate should be 22 percent or 21 percent or 26 percent. our decision will depend on the answer to the question. will this inhibit the exploration for oil. on which the rate is based. it is my judgment that this amendment will  inhibit the exploration for oil. any more than the 271/2 percent has done. and i thank the senator from delaware.
as a practical citizen and a campaigner of longstanding. i k of particular area in the tax bill which sticks more in the public mind as some kind of gimmick and some sort of way by which the rich avoid heavy taxes than this one. however. as a matter of fact. that is  true. as a matter of fact. there are particular iniquities involved in this depletion allowance. it has a great deal of basis and soundness in the national interest. and i have been pleased to find that the senator from delaware takes that position. too. because after studying that situation. he has submitted his amendment. which would bring the rate down.  sensationally. but to 20 percent over a period of years. so i submit that if we show that this particular rate is  a sacred cow and thatat long lastit can  be reformed. and that lobby or power group will prevent us from reforming it. that will be one of the finest demonstrations of the strength of the tax system that we could possibly have. and i think the oil companies will benefit from it. in terms of the public esteem which they will receive. and which i believe they deserve to receive. i agree with the senator from delaware that the oil companies have done a fine job in the public interest. and that they have done many fine things in that connection. in a forwardlooking way. but somehow the american people have come to feel that these oil companies have an inside drag. and that their tax rates can be changedthat other rates can be changed either up or down or across the board. but that this rate is the sacred cow of all sacred cows. i think that attitude is bad for the country and for the tax system. and i hope thatat long lastthe senate will support the senator from delaware. in connection with his amendment.
my remarks will be brief i wish to refer to one other point: the oil industry often suffers severely from strange and unjustified constructions in regard to provisions of the tax law. from the point of view of the income of the industry. and it has complained about that and about the considerable insensibility on the part of those who complain about the effect which the depletion allowance has. and the programs taken under it. and the demands for corrective action in that connection. as compared to other parts of the tax system. therefore. i believe that by means of this amendment the oil companies will be able to do even better than they can do today. because. in the absence of this amendment. the attitude of congress and of the people of the country toward that industry is an unhealthy one. and i believe it is time for a change to be made.
. on page 195. in line 21. and on page 198. in line 2. a change was voted by the senate committee in the portion of the house version which relates to the opportunity for companies in the personal holding company category to liquidate. the house version used the words "the date of the enactment of this subsection." the senate committee version uses the date "december 31. 1963." the senate committee version would thus exclude the calendar year 1963. which many companies use as the basis for paying their taxes. in short. the argument is that they will be discriminated against in this way. because a company which uses as its tax year a fiscal year ending in october or ember would thus have an advantage. is it understood that this question should be considered in conference. because under the house version the effective date will be calendar year 1964. which thereby will exclude calendar year 1963. and is it understood that the conferees will give consideration to the equity of this situation.
 has asked for in his budget specifications. far more must be done if we are to make headway on either problem. one of the most important elements of an effective progrom should be accelerated action in respect to retraining. far beyond what has been scheduled for fiscal year 1965. we are retraining only 15 percent of those who need retraining. it is essential that we enlist the full resources of the private enterprise system in this program. because only private enterprise can do that job and must be brought into it. next. there must be incentives for plant modernization and a tax incentive for exports. we must accelerate. extend. and expand federal assistance to vocational and technical education programs. a commission on automation must be established to make urgent recommendations in this critical area and to provide for the transition of workers and business to automation. legislation is needed to modernize the antitrust laws. such legislation is pending. u.s. private enterprise must be brought effectively into foreign aid. a top committee to do this is called for by the foreign assistance act of 1963. but has  yet been named. aher incentive is a fair employment practices law to deal with discrimination in employment. which is contained in the civil rights bill that will soon be coming over from the house. and we must enact permanent federal standards of unemployment compensation. if we had all these incentives. there would be a reasonable chance to get on top of our balanceofpayments and other ecoic difficulties. including endemic unemployment. if we do . then it seems to me the risk of a tax cut will  have paid off adequately.
. on behalf of myself. my colleague. the junior senator from new york . and the senator from maryland . i submit amendments. intended to be proposed by us. jointly. to the bill to amend section 501(c) (14) of the internal revenue code of 1954 to exempt from income taxation certain profit corporations and associations organized to provide reserve funds for domestic building and loan associations. and for other purposes. i ask unanimous consent that a memorandum. relating to the amendments. be printed in the record.
in the first place. with respect to what the proposed statute provides. it would create only a rebuttable presumption of literacy based upon a certificate of a sixthgrade education. it does  absolutely preclude the state from demonstrating that the holder of that sixthgrade voting certificate is unable to pass a literacy test which is administered in a discriminatory way. so under the proposed statute. the federal government would  be dictating the qualifications for electors. it would merely erect a safeguard to prevent electors from being discriminated against by strange applications of the state requirements. with respect to the other issue relating to south carolina in the civil rights commission report. i should like to read into the record what was said in its 1961 report. under the heading of south carolina: the commission has never received any sworn complaints from south carolina. unfortunately. this lack of complaints can. any more than in the case of georgia. be taken as conclusive proof that there is discrimination in the voting process there. mcormicx county in its 1959 report the commission stated that in mccormick county. where negroes comprised 62.6 percent of the total population. there was  a single negro registered. the first negro had in fact registered in august 1959. however. and three others registered in early may 1960. then the u.s. attorney general annced that the voting records of mccormick were to be inspected. and starting on the day a formal demand for inspection was delivered by fbi agents. 45 more negroes registered. some of these negroes lost their jobs because they had registered. however. and as a consequence only 1 of the 49 registered appears to have voted in the june primary of 1960 and e in the ember 1960 election. fear of reprisals was the principal reason why negroes had  registered until may 1960. and the same fear has deterred any further registration or voting. the report continues:
. also along the same line. the senator from louisiana questioned a chart which i introduced. prepared by the tax foundation. showing for fiscal year 1962 the total federal grants to state and local governments and the estimated burden of federal grants and comparing the states on the basis of the amount paid in federal taxes for every dollar of aid received. as i  have received an uptodate table prepared by the tax foundation on that subject. for fiscal year 1963. i
.  to the business in hand: first. i had a debate last week on title vi of the bill. i made some statements with respect to the critical importance of the right to .withhold federal funds from federalstate segregated programs or programs in which there was some segregation. and i gave flgures at that time as to the amount of support which was available from the federal government for such programs. as compared to the amount which was paid into the federal treasury by those states. at least that pat which was allocated and which went to. federal grants generally was challenged by the senator from louisiana [mr.. long. i have since sought further conflmation of these figures from the library of congress. the figures i gave. were from the tax foundation. inc.. a very reliable concern. nevertheless. i felt it was appropriate to respond to the challenge which has been made t6 those figue. . . i have  had the advice and analysis of the library of congress. i ask unanimous consent to include in the rxcoan as a part of my remarks a new chart. which shows the comparison between the tax foundations findings and those of the library of congress. an explanation by the library of congress of the method by which it prepared its findings. an explanation by the tax foundation as to the way it prepared its findings.
. i present a resolution adopted by the town board of the town of easthester. n.y.. relating to- the reimbursement of states for taxes  collected on property owned by foreign governments. i ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the record. and appropriately referred.
in most of the states of the south there has been considerable agitation about those very questions. a great many lawsuits have been started in order to achieve those very objectives. the difference is that  they must proceed on a casebycase basis. which would take more time than the national interest could afford and more resources than individual citizens can afford. for that reason. those of us who seek such an objective. are seeking to authorize the bringing of such suits under the 14th amendment by the federal government. i should like to ask the senator aher question. if south carolina is so anxious to be itself and  have the rest of the nation tell it what to do. would  that attitude apply to laws raising the necessary taxes to provide for the army. the navy. the air force. enforcement of the narcotics laws. and other laws of that type. suppose the state did  like laws of the kind i have suggested. could the state say. "we will  obey them."
. many jobs which need to be done have  yet been done. and we have right to complain about the result until they are done. i rise today only for the purpose of stating what must be done. once the necessary jobs are done. i believe the result will be certain. morally. constitutionally. and in terms of public order and tranquillity we must do this job. and our deadline is the onset of summer. many senators k that. and the country ks it.  it must be expressed.
i certainly do. the senator from minnesota will recall that in referring to my objectives. i coupled the questions i asked. one of them was with respect to the objectives in connection with section 601. the other was with respect to the objectives in connection with section 602. certainly we wish this agency and other agencies to do their jobs correctly. therefore. i coupled my questions in that way. in order to cover my point that we wish to insure both discrimination and segregation.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point an important statement on fiscal policy for national strength and prosperity issued by the republican critical issues council of the republican citizens committee.
. joseph w. barr. chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation. in a speech delivered at the seventh annual loeb awards presentation luncheon in new york city on may 20. proposed that a select group of highly trained and exceptionally able men and women comprising a national financial reserve be created with the financial support of the fdic and in close cooperation with the council of ecoic advisers. the treasury. the federal reserve system. the bureau of the budget. the department of state and appropriate committees of the congress. he envisages the training of a small group of individuals. expert in the field of political ecoy. trained and able to blend the ecoic needs of the nation with political realities. prepared to serve the nation in areas of high national and international ecoic and financial policy. i believe mr. barr has come forth with an extraordinarily good idea which would make available to this nation talented individuals in an increasingly complex field at a very small cost. and which i herewith highly commend for the consideration of the senate. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point in my remarks mr. barrs speech of may 20.
. i invite the attention of the senate to an editorial published in this mornings new york times. in which the times once again calls for the establishment of a capital issues committee as a more effective measure than the interest equiltzation tax proposed by the administration. as do all americans. i find controls distasteful. however. if measures are needed to bring our balanceofpayments deficit under control they should be effective. i believe that a capital issues committee would be much more effective than the highly inflexible and complex measure proposed by the treasury. as the senate finance committee is about to open hearings on this highly controversial proposal. i commend this editorial to the attention of my colleagues. particularly those who must concern themselves with it. in the first instance. the members of the senate finance committee. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the editorial published in the new york times entitled "controlling capital outflow."
first. i compliment my colleague for proposing the amendment. despite the effort to divert it by the committee amendment to the bill which would make the present tax a manufacturers excise tax. second. i wish to identify myself with the arguments which my colleague has made. third. i wish to point out what the provision in the committee amendment really is. it is essentially a bookkeeping amendment. all that the proponents would do would be to shift the burden of bookkeeping. all of us who have been in the battle before and are in it  k what will happen. i believe only one word of explanation is needed as to why the proposal would  help the consumer. the retailer sets his price by adding his profit to his cost of operation and the price charged him by the manufacturer. under present law. the excise tax is then added at the retail level. the retailer adds the tax on after he has paid the wholesale price and has added on his markup. under the committee proposal the manufacturer would pay the tax and would pass it on to the retailer. who would then compute his markup on the tax as well as on the wholesale price. therefore. when the product got to the consumer. it would have exactly the same price that it had before. the only person who would receive less money would.be uncle sam. . that is hing but kidding ourselves and kidding the public. it is for that reason that i thoroughly agree with my colleague. and i am very pleased to join with him in sponsoring the amendment.
. this the heading of such subchapter is amended amendment would remove the 10 per- - to read as follows: cent tax on admission to the living "subchapter atax on special fuels" theater. it has hing to do with mo- (4) subchapter f of chapter 31 of such tion pictures or any other entertain- code is redesignated as subchapter b. and ment of that character. the heading of such subchapter is amended i understand the senator from rhode to read as follows: island may wish to offer "subchapter bspecial provisions applicaan amendment which would properly ble to tax on special fuels" followon the heels of the last one just (5) sections 4051 through 4053 of such acted on. if he wishes to offer the code are repealed and the table of sections amendment at this time. i do  k for subchapter b (as redesignated by parawhether he is ready- graph (4) of this subsection) is amended by striking out the items relating to sections

. if i may have the attention of the senate for 5 minutes. this is an amendment to take the 10 percent tax off admissions to the live theater. it has hing to do with motion pictures. or anything else. it deals strictly with the live theater. and live musical performances. it is an amendment which i had hoped the committee would take. because the tax is an anachronism. the matter was brought up in february of this year when we were dealing with the general tax reduction bill. i had hoped at that time that it would be considered. and i had every reason to believe that it would be considered sympathetically in connection with this excise tax bill. but the excise tax bill is  before the senate. and this tax has  yet been consideredat all. when the matter was first before the finance committee in- connection with the general tax reduction bill. the senator from louisiana gave us the information that the vote was 9 to 8 to eliminate this anachronistic tax. the reason it was subsequetly swept out of the tax reduction bill was that it was decided that the committee would  at that time deal with any form of excise taxes. the amount of money involved. in comparison with total tax revenues. is minuscule. that is. $6 million annually. but it has this significance: it is almost exactly the same amount of money which .is lost on new productions in the theater. which is approximately $5.5 million a year. i had the assurance. when the matter was brought up before. that whatever we did would be passed on to the theatergoer. the living theater is a dying business. as i believe many of us k. yet it is an essential element of american cultural life. a vast reawakening of interest in this art form is taking place all across the united states at the present time. in many cities repertory theaters are of great benefit to the people locally. i am informed that the following cities have theaters that play touring legitimate theater attractions: washington. baltimore. wilmington. philadelphia. boston. chicago. st. louis. cleveland. cincinnati. detroit. kansas city. minneapolis. st. paul. columbus. ohio. nashville. dallas. houston. fort worth. new orleans. denver. seattle. los angeles. san francisco. portland. omaha. milwaukee. louisville. to show the mortality rate in this field. 77 percent of the new plays produced fail to earn back even the venture capital invested in them. yet the theater has been properly described as the creative core for all the performing arts in this country. including motion pictures and television. the real creativity of new plays. actors. and scenic designers originates from the fundamental creative core of the living theater. which is very heavily shown  throughout the united states in so many repertory theaters. there are some 75.000 professional groups outside of new york which duplicate the 50 to 75 new plays professionally produced in new york every year. this number has been steadily going down because of the costprice squeeze which has been put on such performances. people must pay high prices for tickets. etheless. the federal government still imposes this tax which produces a minuscule amount of tax revenue. in the case of live theater. this is a major factor in the retrogression which has set in. in the suppression rather than the encouragement of its development. clearly. to develop the theater is greatly in the interest of the nation. it should be interesting to senators to k that of the 12.000 members of actors equity. approximately 10 percent. or roughly only 1.200. are  employed. this is  strictly a new york problem. there are  repertory theaters in denver. dallas. san francisco. minneapolis. and many other cities in the country. as i have indicated. we have exempted the profit theater from this tax. and yet despite our interest in private enterprise and creativity in private enterprise. we have kept this small taxwhich is really an anachronismon the living commercial theater. i shall  take the time of the senate any longer. the case has been thoroughly analyzed in the most considered way in an analysis and brief which i placed in the record on february 6. 1964. prepared by john f. wharton. from material compiled by prof. 0. glenn saxon. together with studies. analyses and charts showing in detail what i have just laid before the senate. i conclude as follows: this is an anachronistic tax. the feeling we had about the amendment we have just passed should be translated into a contribution by the senate toward encouraging the theater by repealing this tax. especially since the amount involved is small. but the deleterious effect is very great. as i pointed out. the $6 million that the federal government takes from the theaters just equals what is actually lost in the theaters in any one year. it is discouraging egh to get backing for a theater . we should  make it more discouraging by maintaining this anachronistic tax. the finance committee at one point this year saw fit to take it off. we were then told the time to remove the tax was when we considered excise taxes. i urge the senate to take this opportunity to remove this tax.
i proposed the tax cut on theater tickets. which the senator from louisiana graciously accepted. theater tickets are critically important to my state. that amendment went down the drain with the rest of the amendments. the cooperation of the coordinate branches of congress in respect to taxes is far more overlooked in the breach than in the observance. i say that with the deepest affection for our colleagues on the ways and means committee in the other body. i hope that one day. even at the 11th hourat 4:25 p.m. on the last daywe shall  be driven to refuse to accept such a report and will throw the subject of taxes into a tailspin and put the blame where really. in all fairness. it belongs. i do  believe that the senate is getting the recognition to which it is entitled on this subject. king our colleagues as i do. and king the fight which was put up by the conferees. which. with other senators. i appreciate. i hope that in between seasons that point will be impressed on the house. there is guarantee that we will  become sore around here and really upset the applecart to the embarrassment of everyone. i hope very much that the kledge that we have the capacity to take such actionwe are  irresponsible heremay be used by our colleagues. who i k feel as we do in many of these cases. to advantage in between seasons before we get into a similar jam again.
. such an attitude defies almost every other thing which we are doing in foreign and domestic policy. it defies everything we are seeking to accomplish in international trade. as i just pointed out. it defies everything that we are seeking to accomplish in budget reduction. as i have just pointed out. it defies everything we are seeking to accomplish in benefiting the american consumer by bringing to bear in his favor foreign competition. it defies the fact that we are an open and  a closed world. and we are looking for ingenuity and inventiveness wherever it may be. if it is at home. it is great. if it is abroad it is . it defies the proposition that almost invariably there is some component in an article of domestic manufacture which almost literally must come from abroad. someone will have to wink at the law even if we pass it. because it is almost physically impossible to get a complete item manufactured with every component being manufactured domestically. indeed. some of the rare metals we need to producecertain alloyscan be obtained in the united states. the interesting thing is that under the buy american act itself. in all areas of procurement to which even the buy american act applies. the budget bureau study to which i have referred found 68 percent in fiscal year 1960. 58 percent in fiscal year 1961. and 53 percent in fiscal year 1962 of total procurement represented items which can be obtained in the united states at all. let us remember that it was  a committee amendment that was considered in the other body. it occurred on the floor. we can understand the superflcial attractiveness of it to a state dealing with unemployment. and so forth. we have such problems in my own state. let us take the state of pennsylvania. where the author of this amendment comes from. he made a moving pleaand i deeply understand itfor his state and the fact that workers in his state need to be employed. and that there are pockets of ecoic difficulty. which is true. but even in his own state. the saylor amendment could place hundreds of pennsylvania manufacturers and their employees and their exports to foreign countries in jeopardy. this possibility would show the advisability of a provision such as i propose. the difference is that pennsylvania does  have to consider the question of exportimport trade. the u.s. government is supposed to take care of it. but the united states is  taking care of it in this bill. let us remember that this bill provides twothirds federal aid. it seems to me the height of folly for us to defy our domestic and foreign policy by accepting a provision of this character. i would  lightly seek to change a situation in which my own community of new york has a burning interest. we are deeply interested in mass transportation. i am strongly for the bill. but the ecoy of my state. as is true of many other states. is heavily dependent on an open world in which a maximum amount of international trade is engaged in. in deep conscience. i would have felt it to be in derogation of my duty  to have pleaded for my proposal and to have raised this question. which i feel is so serious and portentous for the future of trade so far as the united states is concerned. especially in view of the exclusive. protectionist nature of the provision. if it is put on the statute books. i appeal to all friends of international trade. i appeal to all friends of budget balance. i appeal to all friends of the consumer. i appeal to all friends of this program  to allow them to be debased by so narrow a provision which is in violation of the policy we have preached to all mankind. it is especially aalous that this provision which is a complete reversal of everything we believe in and have preached in the world. should turn up in this most forwardlooking bill. so i believe we would be doing ourselves a great disservice if we enacted the provision. an effort is being made to avoid a conference. there have been other bills in which this situation has occurred. for example. i have in mind a particular amendment which the senator from pennsylvania proposed to the river basin authorization bill which was pending before the senate last december. and which was also very restrictive.
i certainly would ho the senators thinking as to members of his party. i ho it as to my party. but i think in the river basin bill. which we also handled this year. in the same congress. there was an amendment which provided for domestic procurement unless there was a price differential of 50 percent between the domestic as against the foreign product. the house insisted that it go out. and it was taken out in conference. second. we are  at the end of this session by any means. suppose we sent the bill back with the kind of amendment that we ought to have. instead of the amendment that is  before us. if the house does  like it. it can still send it back to us. there is plenty of time. i rather hazard a guess that we shall be around for a few weeks more. why cave in. it is one thing to cave in on excise taxes. which will expire tonight. but why cave in on this fight. we have been fighting for years. why allow it to be distorted and abusedi say that advisedlyby the kind of provision that has been incorporated in the bill. without trying. at least. what i am proposing to the senateand. incidentally. on a most reasonable basis. finally. . the budget bureau study. to which i have referred about the operation of the buy american act itself. concluded that if the price differential were raised to 25 percent we would get to the point of diminishing returns where it will generally cost much more in the budget than is saved in terms of foreign procurement. so. for all those reasons i believe. first. that it is my duty to propose this amendment. because i believe it is extremely important that voices be raised against trade "othingism" in congress. and because i oppose the superficially attractive idea. "we will buy everything here." which is without any real concern for what happens in the rest of the world. second. i respectfully submit that we have an excellent opportunity to carry our point. we have carried it before.
. i should like to call the attention of my colleagues to an editorial which appeared in tuesdays washington post regarding the interest equalization tax bill presently pending before the senate finance committee. as other newspapers have done on several previous occasions. the post calls into question the consistency of this bill with stated national principles and with the facts of life of international finance. it questions the effectiveness of the pending bill in light of the numerous exemptions built into it. including one for bank loans. it also points out that should longterm interest rates widen between those prevailing in the united states and in western europe. the bill would be rendered ineffectual. according to an article in the new york times last sunday. money rates are. in fact. rising in europe. reflecting the gradual upward creep of both shortterm and longterm interest rates. unless the federal reserve board raises the discount rate in turn. the outflow of u.s. capital will once again resume. the editorial concludes with the statement that if our balanceofpayments deficit should reach menacing proportions. we should require a far more effective measure than a tax affecting one type of capital outflow. and calls for the creation of a capital issues committee should such a situation arise. i ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the washington post. entitled "interest tax alternatives". and the article from the new york times. entitled "rates on money rising in europe." be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i call the attention of the senate to two extremely significant articleswhich appeared in this mornings new york timesconcerning our balanceofpayments situation. an article written by edwin dale. based on official data. reports that during the months of may and june our balance of payments showed substantial improvements. so that for the first half of 1964 our balanceofpayments deficit was running at an annual rate of $1.6 billion. in comparison. over the past 6 years our payments deficit averaged $3 billion each year. should this situation persist during the second half of the year. the united states would have made a great deal of progress toward attaining equilibrium in its international transactions. the second article. written by brendan jones. reports that the national foreign trade council. in a midyear forecast issued yesterday. reached the conclusion that our payments deficit by the end of the year will be about $1.5 billion. down $400 million from the councils estimate at the beginning of the year. this conclusion corroborates the estimate made by mr. dale. according to the council. an increased outflow of private capital. which is expected to come after the enactment by congress of the interest equalization tax. would be the main debit item in this nations overall transactions with other countries. the council predicts further improvements in our exports and a milder gain for our imports. with an indicated export surplus of $6.5 billionthe largest favorable trade balance for this country since the years immediately after world war ii. i believe that these estimates. in addition to other evidence. seriously damage the administrations case in support of the interestequalizationtax proposal. our balanceofpayments deficit is improving. the tax is supposed to cut down the outflow of private capital. yet the council estimates that the capital outflow for 1964 will be $4.8 billion. compared to $4.2 billion in 1963. the councils estimate in january estimated an outflow of $3.1 billion. due to private capital exports in 1964. as the article states: the increase in the outflow of private capital was expected to come after the enactment by the congress of proposed taxes on new foreign securities. once the effects of these levies are kn. foreign borrowing in this country is expected to resume in large volume. i have repeatedly stated that the tax would be ineffective. the evidence presented in the two articles confirms my belief that the improved ecoic climate in the united states. caused by the tax cut and by changes taking place in western europe which tend to satisfy european capital requirements from european sources to a larger degree than heretofore. and have improved our trade position. removes any justification which may have existed for this proposal in july i ask unanimous consent that the two articles. entitled "balance of payments improves" and "recurrence of big deficit seen." be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
of the two versions of reporting financial holdings. i prefer the version of the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from new jersey . and i shall vote to support it. i believe there is a grave problem. and i think the senator from illis [mr. dirkseni. has perceived it clearlynamely. the atmosphere of fabricating accusations against ourselves by being overly conscious of what we should and should  disclose. as to the standard of a $100 gift. a gift may be worth $105 or $85. depending on what it is for. the whole question of real and personal friendships is involved. many friends give me gifts. but i give them gifts which are worth at least as much. if  more. we are placed in an odd light. we are elected officials. we are high officials of the government. we are dealing with reality.  theory. the senator from new jersey and the senator from pennsylvania have offered us the very highest standard conceivableto some extent. even impracticable. etheless. it is a high standard. in view of the fact that the country looks to us to set a very high standard. we ought to start with that. then if it is found to be impracticable. there will be a much better climate for making the standard more practicable than if we started with very little. indicating that we were rather grudgingly entering into this field. so. although i have some serious reservations upon the gift standard and the matter of tax returns. since there is a good deal of information that might be mischievously used. on balance i believe. as i have voluntarily disclosed and my colleague from new york has voluntarily disclosed. we would rather help in setting the fashion of disclosure in accordance with the principles followed by the new york legislature which. as i have said. i had experience in putting into effect. i shall support the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from new jersey on the ground that. since we are acting in response to to a real need. we had better do the maximum. as this is selfregulation. and then reduce it if it is found to be impracticable. rather than the other way around. on that ground. i shall support the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from new jersey.
the senator from pennsylvania mentioned a while ago that he was rather pleased to join in cosponsoring a successful amendment with my colleague from new york . so i suppose it is about as broad as it is long.  to establish quotas for individual ports of entry into the united states. this may very well be seriously questioned under the constitution. section 9. article 1. states that "preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one state over those of aher." aside from all these questions. i should like to point out one other. and then i shall be through.
that is correct. i am  an expert on this subject. they used to call me the windowbox farmer of new york in the house of representatives. but i am an expert on consumers. i have to be. we have millions in new york. as they have in every other populous industrious center. i am speaking in the interest of the consumers. if we keep an umbrella over this business and at the same time prevent the law of supply and demand from taking effect. it will cut off competition. the ecoy will  operate properly. consumers will be hurt irremediably. this is quite apart from the harm to the reciprocal trade picture of the united states. it is in that interest that i am speaking. which interest i represent. which i have every right to represent. and which needs to be represented in matters of this kind before the senate. it is in the interest of the consumer. and of the foreign ecoic policy of our country that i ask that the senate vote to recommit the bill
 asked for this tax on july 18. 1963. it was specified that it would be retroactive until july 19. 1963. except for some modest exception for listed securities. as to which it is retroactive to august 17. 1963. for all practical purposes. therefore. both borrowers and lenders and both sellers and buyers of foreign securities have been inhibited since that time. for all practical purposes. transactions have dried up. it has been widely advertisedand i shall demonstrate the fallacy of that argument in a few minutesthat this represents the great success of the interest equalization tax idea. i point out that congress is supinely doing the treasurys bidding. in that the bill  before the senate would carry out the very retroactivity called for by the treasury. whether justified or  is immaterial. all we are doing is making good on a postdated check issued by the treasury of the united states. that is all we are doing. if this proposal were justified on the merits. we are  above being humble about our prerogatives and going ahead to do what needs to be done. but it is  justified on the merits. as i said when i opened my remarks. time has passed this whole situation by. this remedy is inapposite and inappropriate to what is being sought. it will  accomplish it. and certainly one will pretend that the bill should be passed for the purpose of raising $30 million a year in revenue. which is the estimate of the amount of revenue the bill would produce. there are many ways to produce more revenue than that. all that the bill would do would be to single out the united states before the whole world as a nation that does  k how to deal with the situation of being the financial leader of the world. the united states would be acting in a manner which would be very dangerous in its implications. in order to cut down on the outflow of capital. such capital outflows are inherent to the idea of being the leading financial power in the world. the leading banker in the world. let us remember that because we have this status  it does  mean that we shall have it forever. also. the fact that we have this status  is very valuable to the united states. the fact is that in the modern world. in the private enterprise society in which we live. the power to control credit is as valid as money in the bank and resources. in short. the credit standing of the united states and its ability to have its obligations marketed anywhere in the world at face value. with complete reliance upon the value of the dollar throughout the world. are the elements of our greatest strength. what is russia suffering from . russia is suffering from the fact that she is  credit worthy. that she can go out into the markets of the world and borrow. as can the united states. she must pay cash on the barrelhead. one of the best examples is the fact that even in the wheat deal made between the united states and russia on a very short term credit basis of some 18 months. we had a terrific row in the senate about the fact that russias communist government had credit worthiness at alland i believe that is correct. at the same time. i can stand by. representing a state which contains the greatest financial markets in the world. and the best financial brains in the world. and see the united states take an illadvised positionwhich we would take should this socalled interest equalization tax bill be enactedand deprive itself in that way of its standing as the sophisticated leader of the world in banking. credit. and finance. that is why i have consistently and constantly opposed the measure. why i oppose it today. and why i shall offer alternatives to it which will be much better designed to accomplish what is sought to be accomplished by this el and unusual tax. and also better designed to prevent that strain and embarrassment to our leadership of the world in terms of banking and finance which would be represented by adoption of this tax.
perhaps the senator from louisiana and i are speaking at cross purposes. the amendment which i have on the 25percent proposal would materially reduce the impact of the interest equalization tax. as amended. it would  be the bill before us at all. a standby capital issues committee would be good for the bill. i would  wish senators to have any idea that i intend to vote for the bill as it is  before the senate. i intend to vote against it. unless it is revised to reflect what i consider to be. in modestyand i am  pretending to be any bigger than my breechesthe measure calculated to do what we need to have it do. i expect to explain that in detail. rather than use the "broadsword" approach represented by the interest equalization tax. we must first understand exactly what is the factual situation before we can understand what needs to be the remedy. let us remember that the issue originated when our authorities were in great alarm about the continuance over a period of years of the deficit in the u.s. balance of payments. i and other senators invited marked and striking attention to the fact that we were running a serious imbalance in our international payments and that sooner or later we had to do a number of things about it. that imbalance first alarmed us when it represented the figure of about $31/2 billion for the year 1958. it concerned us deeply withstanding the fact that in 1960 it reached its high watermark of $3.181 million and then began to be reduced. by the end of 1963. the imbalance in our international payments was running approximately $1.942 million. let us remember. then. the frame of reference generally contiguous to that time. when secretary dillon testified before the joint ecoic committee. of which i am a member. and i questioned him closely as to what would be a deficit in our international payments with which we could live. my best recollection of his testimony was that he said that we could live with a balanceofpayments deficit something in the area of $1 billion to $2 billion continued indefinitelyfor a considerable number of years. in 1962. the deficit in our international payments at the end of the year ran at an average figure of approximately $2.200 million. in 1963. after being very large earlier in the yearwhich is the alleged reason for bringing in this interest equalization taxit very materially diminished toward the end of the year. so that we ended up within the $2 billion figure to which i have referred. it is interesting that in the very year in which this interest equalization tax was brought out. our imbalance in international payments had already been reduced to a figure which is alleged to be acceptable. the excuse for the tax was the alleged unusual outflow of private longterm capital from the united states abroad. which the treasury claimed contributed so unusually to our imbalance in international payments that it had to be stopped. hence. the very drastic tax was proposed. as soon as the tax was proposed. the uncertainty thus engendered cut off almost entirely u.s. private longterm foreign investment of the kind which is reached by the tax. but our problem is  whether dollars go out of the united states for investment abroad. there is a great deal to be said for dollars going out for investment. which produces income. as i shall demonstrate in a little while. because we get more income from our investments than we invest abroad every yearincluding the worst year picked by the treasury. what matters to us is that the dollars go out at all. as i shall demonstrate in a little while. the fact that there was a crackdown on u.s. foreign investment. practically drying it up. did  stop dollars from going out. the dollars were going out on commercial loans. for example. and those commercial loans are exempted from the bill. in short. the bill is as riddled with exceptions as a sieve. it is so impractical that it can be administered in the way that those who designed it wanted to have it administered. yet permit us to continue to do business in the world. the exceptions themselves would nullify the effect of the law. as i shall prove shortly. hence. we would have the law with all its disadvantages it would cause to the american leadership of finance and business in the world. without retaining for us its benefits. the dollars would go out just the same. one thing that is often forgotten is that the big factor in the balance of payments of the united states is our trade surplus. if we did  have our trade surplus. we would really be broke in a very real way. the trade surplus is  running at approximately $61/4 billion a year. and anything that rocks that boat on a basis as problematical and impractical as the interest equalization tax is too infinitely dubious a maneuver for the united states. i point out something which is very interesting. i stated that the income on our investments exceed the outgo. referring to the charts of the committee itself. $2.609 million in longterm capital. presumably. left the united states in 1962. our income on foreign investments that year was $3.850 million. in the succeeding year of 1963. against the figure of $3.188 million of alleged longterm foreign investment. our income was $3.982 million from foreign investments. that is  all. this bill would exempt many people. senators in looking at the chart which the committee has prepared. on page 5. will see that the great bulk of new securities which we are trying to cut off originated in canada and. japan. the report is frank egh to state that it is expected that canada would be exempt. for a very good reason. we have a large export balance of trade with canada. if we embarrass the canadians by raising capital here. they could very neatly cut off a big part of our income from our export surplus. that would be an extremely unprofitable deal. when one examines the chart. he finds that for the year 1962. almost onehalf of the total outflow of dollars from the united states in terms of new issues of foreign securities was investment in canada. and when one adds to that about 10 percent for investments in japan. and aher 15 or 20 percent for other exempted investments. like that for latin america. or other less developed countries. he finds mighty small pickings left in what this tax is going to effect. it would effect very little. i say advisedlyand i believe i can prove it in the course of this debatethat the value of the investments from the united states would  be appreciably diminished by this tax. it would continue practically unimpaired. indeed. most of the authorities say that very thing. the only thing that we shall have gotten out of this proposal will be the reputation of being amateurs in the matter of handling our international balance of payments. and a grave impairment of our position in the capital market of the world and in the banks of the world. a $30 million profit from this tax would be the most unprofitable $30 million we have ever taxed in the history of this country. in my judgment.
. i ask unanimous consent that a table entitled "level of longterm rates in selected countries." based on data supplied by the federal reserve board. to which i have referred. may be printed in the record.
ial task force on the balance of paymentswhich suggests effective approaches to our balanceofpayments problem on the basis of cooperative steps by government and private enterprise. may very well confuse our friends overseas. on the one hand. we put barriers in the way of u.s. citizens purchasing foreign securities. while on the other. we propose to persuade foreigners to buy more u.s. securities. i again point out.  that the senator from ohio is present. that in his absence i made a point that i should like to repeat in his presence. one of the arguments made by the senator from louisiana for the bill is that we have lost gold and that we have only $2.8 billion to satisfy $23 billion in u.s. liquid liabilities abroad. the rest of the gold is insulated by the 25 percent reserve requirement. namel3. about $12 billion. and that we have lost in the past 7 or 8 years about $7 billion in gold. the measure before the senate would  put us in a position to pay all of those calls on gold. it could  possibly do so. what its advocates say is that it would indicate that we are trimming our sails intelligently. in a financial way. to try to get better control over our international balance of payments. i have pointed out that our contribution will be miniscule. that the same amount of dollars. or more. will flow out. because of the interest rate advantage. because of the advantage of the great american financing facilities which the underwriters have. because every kledgeable witness before the committee thought that this measure would  cut the outflow at all. but that it would give the united states a black eye in the eyes of the world as the financial leader of the world. hing could be worse for inducing foreigners to call their debts on the united states than by its being embarrassed by improperly conducting its international financial affairs. hing could be worse than that. it would be far worse than the miniscule amount that would be gained by the enactment of this tax. in addition. the trend of the gold flow has been reversed. we are beginning to get some value as a result of that trend. in april 1964. there was an increase of $178 million.in gold stocks.
. a remedy is supposed to do what is claimed for it. it is clear that this remedy is  doing it. i challenge the figures the senator from louisiana has given. the senator has stated that the imbalance in 1963 was $5 billion. it was $1.94 billion. a very different figure. i defy the senator to show me how. when this tax will expire in 1965. we are going to prevent the outflow of foreign investments. it is claimed that our gold reserves declined from about $25 billion to $15 billion in the past 7 years. what is here proposed would make it far more likely that foreign creditors would demand payment. because we would have shown ourselves as complete amateurs. the senator gave the analogy of the bank. i believe i k something about banking. a bank does  impose a tax on the withdrawal of money. a bank may have to limit withdrawals. as this country could have done had congress so provided. it has  decided to impose direct controls on the outflow of capital. this is done by other countries. practically every other country has controls over capital fluctuations. but what is proposed here is "amateur hour." if anything. it depreciates rather than builds up confidence on the part of foreign creditors in our ability to act as the monetary leader of the world.
if the senators argument is correct. we need measures which are effective. my main argument against the proposed tax 13 that it would be ineffective. of course it is a mild measure. it is so mild that it is meaningless. it would only embarrass us. that is the essence of my argument.
i should like to give some facts and figures first the senator from louisiana said that i was mistaken about my balanceofpayments figures. that they were running at the rate of $5 billion in the quarter before the tax was annced. of course. our balanceofpayments deficit increased during the second quarter of 1963. but it had gone up on other occasions also. perhaps we should  be discussing this bill at all. because the present imbalance in u.s. international payments. for the first quarter of 1964. is only $168 million. and it has been going at that rate. it seems to me that we have done a brilliant job on that basis. because the inhibition that the senator speaks about is  an inhibition at all. what we have lost in peas we have gained in bananas. we have cut off foreign investment in this country. which mally takes $700 million or $800 million of american money. i am  talking about the total flotation. the question is how many dollars went out of the united states. we have given more than that back in commercial loans. which have gone up from $400 million to $1.400 million.
if i sought to remove that sentence. i would be destroying the effect of the approach we are trying to take. this particular approach assumes that the bill will be passed. and that. therefore. we must make the best of a bad situation. one of the real curses of the bill is its inflexibility. it provides for an acrosstheboard tax of 15 percent on foreign stocks. and a sliding scale of tax varying from 2.75 to 15 percent on debt obligations. depending on their maturity. if we have regulation. the regulation which i suggest might sound tougher. but it is much more practical and much more likely to reduce the amount of interference with the capital market. we often get a statute that is so inflexible that one can do anything about it. the situation continually changes. the control over it. of course. is in the hands of congress. we can repeal the statute if we are dissatisfied with the way in which such authority is being administered. we can hold the secretary to account. as we often do. but the theory of the amendment requires this flexibility. the theory of the amendment is to protect us against runaway dollars over. above. and beyond what we are willing to have go into foreign investments. it is attractive to us in terms of the return which it produces. and the rates which it encourages. in order to follow out that legislative plan effectively. senator keating and i. who are proposing the amendment. can be ourselves inflexible where we are trying to introduce an element in a bad situation of flexibility. as a way in which to endeavor to reduce its deleterious influence.
it would be impossible for me in the time left to me in this debate to frame the legislative criterion. i should therefore like to state the purpose of the amendment. which includes the criterion. i am sure that if the amendment is agreed to. the criterion can be framed later. the criterion. roughly stated. is to exempt from the tax such percentage of foreign flotations as are mally disposed of to american residents within the limitation of an acceptable outflow of dollars for foreign investment from the united states. which is estimated by the treasury to be in the neighborhood of $700 to $800 million a year. that is as congently as i can state at the moment my intention in offering this amendment. i would expect. if the amendment were agreed to. that in conference the actual language of the criterion would be properly phrasedwhich would probably be impossible to do under these stressesto be included in that amendment. on the basis of which the secretary would be authorized to act.
the relationships between the underwriters and the treasury department are of such character that we are dealing with people in the highest class of business. one would  need any law in order to get an underwriter to do what the treasury department wants done. whether the provision was written into the bill or . in addition. i believe. the responsiveness of the treasury department to the congress is so close that if we hauled the secretary up here because we were dissatisfied. we would get action. i agree with the senator about the criterion. but i feel that having phrased the criterion and stated it as the author of the amendment. we can rely on the fact that if that amendment is agreed to. that condition will be carried out. i believe in this case it is  a matter of an order of magnitude that a congressional committee should be ask~d to go into it on every occasion when discretion is exercised. for example. in the consideration there is considerable discretion on the part of the treasury department in the application of the rates of interest which exist. i do  k of any other delegation. but there are many. i am sure. in the tax field. and in the money raising field.
. i point out to the senate that professor smithwhose testimony was referred to by the senator from ohio in his statementsaid that he could find adequate support which he could identify for this unusual and extraordinary position. in reference to the explanation of the senator from minnesota as to the desire  to raise interest rates in the united states. it seems to me this is exactly what we must seek to avoid the use of taxation fornamely. a social purpose. if it has any such purpose. it certainly is an inartistic way to approach the situation. and we should turn it down. let me repeat. so that senators will understand the plan under which i am proceeding. that i am seeking to perfect the bill. if my amendment should fail. i shall then offer a substitute for the entire billnamely. the capital issues committee. which was described by a. good many witnesses who appeared before the committee. let me say to the senator from iowa that i would hope very much that he could support my amendment. being pressed for time. i find it difficult to agree with him on an amendment that would add a criterion to my amendment. i feel that senators will  be running any material risk in assuming that a criterion of the kind which i have described will. in the appropriate language. be written into the bill at the appropriate time.
. i wish to address myself briefly to a point made by the senator from pennsylvania with respect to my position on this bill. he spoke about the fact that international bankers naturally want to do business in this field. in the first place. we are  enacting laws to prevent americans from doing business. they have a legitimate right to do so. i hope we have  reached that point. in the second place. i can hardly convince the senate that the interest equalization tax is unwise with that argument. and i would  endeavor to do so. the senate will  be persuaded by any such argument. what i have been arguing to the senate is the national interest of this country in its financial leadership. i have argued it in terms of dollars. in terms of exports and imports. in terms of the productivity of this country. in terms of the power of this country and its superiority. which is  enjoyed in the communist regimes of soviet russia or china. which in itself is power in terms of checkmating communism. and in terms of the wellbeing of the people. which is also inherent in this kind of ecoic superiority. it is in those terms that i have analyzed the issue in greater detail. and by which i have sought to convince the senate that the interest equalization tax would  accomplish the purpose for which it is designed. but. on the contrary. would bedevil american leadership in the world. downgrade it. and thereby weaken the financial and national interests of the united states. this is the first of the two amendments i shall offer to the bill. it is an amendment to perfect the bill if it should become law. the next amendment is a substitute for the bill. and provides for a capital issues committee. i shall then be ready to go to a vote. the amendment before the senate provides that 25 percent of any foreign issue floated to american residents. or such percentage. above or below. as the secretary of the treasury may determine to be required by the american balanceofpayments position at a particular time. shall be exempt from the tax. this represents the amount which is mally utilized with respect to american residents of foreign flotations. it points up and emphasizes. in substance. that the theory that a $100 million flotation results in an outflow of $100 million is untrue. based on the facts which the committee cites. the great majority of them are sold abroad. but by american distribution organizations. a mi part is sold in this country. and could represent some dollar outflow. that fact points up that bankers. lawyers. and other people who function in this field are getting hidden imports of dollars of value to us. because they come into this country in payment for all those services. on that ground. perfecting the bill so that it is really workable. i ask the senate to support the amendment.
the principle of retroactivity in taxation is  unusual both from the reduction side and the addition side. however. when we are dealing with so many dynamic transactions. as we are here. it represents a most unusual utilization of the retroactive principle.
madam president. i refer  to the substitute for the bill. which i have offered. in essence it gives standby authority to the president. to establish a capital issues committee. which would have jurisdiction in respect of issues of foreign securities in the united states. it is really a measure of voluntary control over capital issue flotation in this country. the committee is to be established by the president. if he desires to invoke the authority. and he may thereupon approve a voluntary agreement or program or conduct of activities of the committee if he finds it is in the national interest. from that point on. the committee would function as an autoous body for this purpose. the amendment would give the president standby authority. which he could in turn delegate to any officer or agency of the united states. such as the secretary of the treasury. the amendment is a classic alternative to the kind of unique tax which is provided in the bill. the interest equalization tax. . the amendment exempts from the antitrust laws acts by u.s. persons which occur while authority conferred on the president by this act is in effect. if such acts are pursuant to a request by the president and found by the president to be in the national interest. under this authority. the president or the secretary of the treasury could prescribe guidelines regarding the overall value of new foreign securities that may be sold in any one year to u.s. residents without undue jeopardy to the u.s. balanceofpayments position. in turn. the capital issues committee. that could be created under this authority would advise the treasury of the advisability. in their judgment. of the sale of individual new foreign securities. such a capital issues committee would be composed of investment bankers. underwriters. and other key representatives of the u.s. financial community. as well as representatives of the general public and the treasury. the secretary of the treasury. or his designee. could appropriately act as chairman of the committee. the first question asked about this matter is. is there a precedent for it. of course. there is a very clear precedent. that precedent exists in the committee called the voluntary credit restraint committee. established by the federal reserve board in march 1951. under the provisions of section 708 of the defense production act of 1950. the federal reserve board was delegated authority by the president to develop a voluntary program to restrain domestic credit. this was at the time of the korean war. the federal reserve board. in close consultation with the voluntary credit restraint committee. developed a program for voluntary credit restraint and issued a statement of principles. it was the committees primary responsibility to establish criteria for distinguishing between essential and essential credit at the time of what was tantamount to a national emergency. the committee issued a series of bulletins covering various kinds of credit. and specifying the kinds which it would allow. the national committee also set up regional committees to deal with the same problems in various sections of the country. was the committee on voluntary credit restraint effective. the answer is that it was. we find the first clue to its activities in the federal reserve bulletins of july 1951. in which it was stated: through voluntary cooperation of thousands of individual financing institutions under the program. progress has been made in the restriction or postponement of credit  essential to the ecoy at this time. * * * while it is impossible to determine precisely the volume of credit that has been denied. a very large number of loan requests. including several sizable ones. have been delayed or refused by lenders acting voluntarily in accordance with the principles of the program. in ember 1951 the federal reserve bulletin reported again that: the voluntary credit restraint program has been one of the factors contributing to the abatement of inflationary pressures during the late spring and summer of 1951. the federal reserve bulletin of march 1952the service of this committee having ended in may 1952. following about a year of operation. something like the period of time which the proposed tax is expected to remain in effectdeclared: at the outset of the program. which was without precedent in the countrys financial history. there was widespread skepticism as to what might be accomplished by a selfregulation effort in the highly competitive field of lending. this has been supplanted by a recognition that the program has proved practicable. workable. and effective as a supplement to national and regional committees. consisting of representatives of financial institutions which extend to all parts of the country. have provided lenders with criteria which have assisted them in differentiating between those credits which are essential and those which are . as a result. the need for credit restraint in the interest of a sound dollar has become more widely understood that probably could have been accomplished by any other means. unlike the measure presently under consideration. the level of capital outflows due to the sale of new foreign securities could be effectively controlled by the capital issues committee. that it would  be a departure from established united states practices is evidenced by the voluntary credit restraint committee. to which i have referred. at present the u.s. government exercises control over such international financial transactions as those involving aid and department of defense. unlike the interest equalization tax proposed by the administration. the capital issues committee would be a standby operation and would be established by the president only if our balanceofpayments situation again reached a eritical status. also. such a committee could be dismantled at will. this would  be the case with the tax proposed by the administration. because the tax would remain in effect until the end of 1965. whether needed or . and would have to be repealed by law in order to abolish it beforehand. it would apply across the board. matter what the interest might be in respect of the issue. except in respect of generic exemptions. which. incidentally. take the heart out of the tax. and provide that canada shall be exempt. undoubtedly the exemption will be extended to japan.
this is a delegation by the congress of the taxing power of the congress to the president on a standby basis. this is breaking the line on a principle which many senators have been so thoroughly committed to defend against. namely. giving the executive standby authority to tax anything. or to use the taxing power of the congress.
i should like to cite more of the figures in the prospectus. the exact evidence is the best. i quote from the prospectus dated june 3. 1964: the company has operated at a loss in each of its last 3 fiscal years and has never paid a dividend. as of december 31. 1963. the companys current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $203.003. and it had a deficit in retained earnings of $127.625. i point out. too. that what i was arguing a little while ago about experience was in the field of mass transport. the reason that i also made reference to the military experience with helicopters was to demonstrate the great importance of this breakthrough in transportation with respect to its military application and to point out. also. the helicopters important role in military activity. especially in vietnam. the argument concerning the helicopters transportation capacity has been made by the senator from washington . i think it is sound. as cities spread out. there will be more and more need for this kind of transportation. hours will be saved in automobile travel. for example. in the new york area. a vacation home is one that is as far as 100 miles away. some are even farther away than that. in western areas. i think that is even more true. that is desirable. very soon. it will  be possible to get into new york through kennedy ot newark. it will be necessary to use airports much farther away. my guess is that it will be as much as from 50 to 70 miles away. a number of them are  being discussed. that will make helicopter operations infinitely more important.
 to determine how the unused quota numbers should be allocated among the various categories of applicants and gives to the *o 0 congress the power of veto by concurrent resolution. some 51.000 quota numbers were left unused in the fiscal year just ended. once again. we must resort to aher urgently necessary. last minute stopgap device. which should have been made unnecessary by enactment of the long overdue. overall quota system reform which has been promised for this session. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be permitted to remain at the desk for 2 days to give senators who might wish to cosponsor the bill an opportunity to do so.
 standby authority. to impose at his discretion. a tax upon the credit system of the united states as it is used abroad. if i were  here to see it. i would  have believed it. i would have felt that it was inconceivable that something like that should have happened. but here it is. and without egh opposition to warrant a rollcall or an effort to reject the conference report on this ground. senators ought to consider this situation very seriously. this measure is to expire in 1965. withstanding all the assurances given to the contrary. once these programs are started. it is very difficult to stop them. i have doubt that an effort will be made to extend the authority. i hope congress will study the record in light of what is being done and will take heed that with this kind of uniced measurein spite of the efforts i have made to bring it to icecongress is transferring to the executive its jealously held power to tax. which it has heretofore so zealously guarded.
it is a fact that veterans organizations and veterans have  always agreed with the bureau of the budget and the veterans adininlstration. indeed. sometimes they have been sharply at odds. i think that this bill makes some sense to a majority of the committee as the senates position. i k that the senator would join me in inviting those who upon consideration feel that they are dissatisfied to express themselves strongly to the conferees and to the rest of us who will still have to approve the conference report.
i believe this congress will go down as the "education congress." we owe a great debt of gratitude to the senior senator from oregon. on many matters he often finds himself challenged by a majority of the senate. as i do. too. when it comes to education. however. i think he has shown such a delicacy of leadership in terms of exactly what could and could  be done that the whole country should be grateful to him. this achievement. which has often been effectuated by him. withstanding his own deeply held convictions on many occasions to the contrary. because of the vast requirements of american education. makes the adoption of the report a sort of summing up of the accomplishments of this congress in this field. it should be deeply gratifying to the senator from oregon.
. i send to the desk three measures designed to make broad reforms in the international monetary system and to deal with the grave problem of our balanceofpayments deficits. the first is a bill which would reduce the gold requirement against both federal reserve deposits and federal reserve es in circulation. in the one case from the present 25 to 10 percent. and in the other case from the present 25 to 15 percent. the administrations bill would eliminate the 25percent gold reserve requirement with respect to federal reserve deposits only. i believe we must face it far more realistically than the administration contemplates.
. i shall  go into the basic details for the actions which i have described. the failure of the administrations remedies to deal effectively with our balanceofpayments problems has been underscored once again by the latest report on the state of our balance of international payments. according to preliminary reports during the final quarter of 1964. the overall deficit in our international payments shot up to an annual rate of $4 billion or 50 percent above the actual deficit for 1963. and double the average for the first three quarters of 1964. the size of the u.s. treasury gold stock has declined to $15.187 billion as of january 20. 1965. the ratio of gold certificate reserves to federal reserve es and deposit liabilities  totals 27.8 percent. down from 29.5 percent at the end of 1963 and from 32.2 percent 2 years ago. our gold supply fell by $125 million in 1964 and officials estimate the loss of aher $500 million worth of gold in 1965. the outflow of private capital also continues at an unacceptably high rate. offering convincing proof that the administrations measurethe interest equalization taxhas been ineffective. our balanceofpayments deficit is caused by a variety of reasons: a high rate of private capital outflows. increasing imports. u.s. foreign ecoic aid grants and credits. military aid. and the need to maintain a large military establishment overseas.
. with further reference to the legislation we have just acted upon. as my colleagues k. new york state is the second largest producer of class i fluid milk in the country. i am. therefore. very much concerned over the reduction in funds in the administrations budget for the vital special milk program. funds for which are included in this bill. the 1966 budget request for this program is $100 million. while the fiscal year 1965 appropriation was $103 million. senator holland. the chairman of the agricultural appropriations subcommittee. the senior senator from wisconsin . along with many other interested senators. have worked to insure that sufficient funds have been provided each year for this essential program. i want to assure the distinguished senator from florida and my colleague from wisconsin that i shall continue to work just as hard as in the past to insure that necessary funds for the special milk program are included in this years department of agriculture appropriation bill. the record of committee hearings on house joint resolution 234 reveals that the fiscal year 1965 estimate of realized losses for the special milk program is $305 million. i would like to make it clear that any reduction in funds for this program would  only impose a penalty on lowincome families. but might also end up in losses for the government if purchases of surplus milk were necessary at 75 percent of parity. i hope that the appropriations committee will do all possible to insure that sufficient funds for the special milk program are provided in the fiscal year 1966 agricultural appropriation bill.
with all due respect to the senator from ohio . i do  believe that anyone will be robbed because he bought u.s. bonds. i do  agree with that comment. . this is  the kind of matter in which one engages in sharply exacerbated debate. but i believe that it is important that we understand the merits of the controversyif indeed there be one. if we are really going into it. we should do so in the interests of the people and in the interests of a wise policy for our nation. federal reserve es have increased regularly by an approximate figure of $1.2 billion to $2 billion a year. in varying amounts. let me ask the senator this question: if. according to the basis on which credit is expanded by the federal reserve system. namely. on the basis of production of goods and services in the united states. it is necessary to expand federal reserve e issues to support ecoic expansion of the united states. and those e issues press against that ceiling. namely. the ceiling of the 25percent gold cover. as they threaten to do. should we refrain from issuing the currency. should we cut back on commercial and industrial operations and  employ the people who have an opportunity to be employed. would the senator from colorado tell me whether it is possible for us to do this.
the present gold reserve requirement does  represent the security of our currency. as is obvious from the fact that we have $15 billionsomeodd in gold which serves today as reserve against $53 billion in federal reserve es and deposit liabilities and against which we have assumed over $28 billion in shortterm liabilities to foreign governments and individuals as well as international and regional organizations. there is also the outstanding debt of the united states. if my memory serves me correctly. i believe this comes to a rough total of about $400 billion. if we are going to depend on this $15 billion in gold to insure confidence in our currency. the united states will be washed up quickly. if i may state my views briefly. what gives us confidence in our currency. first is the production of goods and services in this country which is responsible for 50 percent of the production of hard goods in the world. second is the fact that we have a governmental mechanism in the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banking systems which prevents us from printing currency. because currency and credit must be directly related to the production of goods and services.

i may  agree with any one of the senators proposals. but i certainly think it is fine when senators who oppose seek creatively to find alternatives and propose them. i am glad to see this constructively critical approach by the senator from texas. i have also ed his feeling about the poll tax and that of the senator from mississippi. which i can understand. and i will speak on that matter later. it is most helpful when senators dissent in a certain matter. when there is a great national problem involved. put forward their own ideas as to how they think those problems should be corrected.
. those of us who are proponents of the bill have found. in recent days. so much concentration of attention on the issue of the poll tax which. interestingly egh. is eliminated by bills pending in both this and the other body. that we thought it might be useful to discuss the matter again. to make our position clear on the record. and to underline the fact that elimination of the poll tax would represent a really tangible and practical element of progress in the field of civil rights. it is interesting to me that we have acted cautiously with respect to this problem in the past by adopting a constitutional amendment which eliminates it only as to federal elections. but that we  find this half measure does  really cure the situation. for all practical purposes. the voter is still called upon to pay the poll tax. i believe that it is fair to call the poll tax an anachronism. it is difficult to see how it can be defended by anyone except on the basis that the states should be permitted to do whatever they please in terms of defining as a qualification something which is  a qualification. or in terms of clinging to every vestigial institution. whatever it may be. including the poll tax. which places restrictions upon the voting right. as a constitutional lawyer. it is my judgmentand i put into practice what i teach in theory. by introducing legislation to eliminate the poll tax by statute on previous occasionsthat the poll tax can be eliminated by statute. this is central. i believe. to the theme of the majority on the judiciary committee which supported the amendment. that the poll tax in fact represents a burden on the voting right and an abridgment of the voting right within the context of the 15th amendment. and that as it has worked out it represents discrimination in favor of those who are ecoically able to pay and against those who are ecoically unable to pay. (at this point mr. tydi took the chair as presiding officer.)
i shall  endeavor to debate the senator at this moment. but the senator from arkansas might enlighten us if he would tell us the reason for the elimination of the poll tax by the state of arkansas by a constitutional amendment. the argument made to the people of the state must have been persuasive to induce them to do that.
. may i ask the senator from arkansas whether he believes that the reason for the elimination of the poll tax was the fact that it was considered impractical to use the poll tax in state elections since it was barred in federal elections by a constitutional amendment.
i refer to the helicopter appropriation. which is of interest to new york and a number of other areas of the country. as i understand. the senate conferees sought to insist on the senate amendment. which allowed $942.000. the house conferees refused to take it. so that it is a matter in disagreement. i understand the house voted it down by a vote of 228 to 144. is this a question which could be raised in the independent offices appropriation bill for fiscal year 1966. am i correct in that.
if it is agreeable with the senator. i should like to make a few statements. this is the first time that i shall have commented upon the substitute filed by the senator from montana and the senator from illis which is popularly kn as the leadership substitute. first. the substitute is further evidence of the seriousness with which the leadership in this body has taken the views of the socalled liberals who have taken the position that it is high time. in the interest of the nation. that we have a really effective voting rights bill. we have had the acts of 1957. 1960. and 1964. the old line of leaving it entirely to the eventuations of court proceedings has  seemed to work. so we have had to do something else. in my judgment. the substitute is a material improvement over the bill sent to congress by the administration. although in effect it "leapfrogged" the bill reported by the committee. the senate has full power to seek to amend the substitute if it can be whipped into shape. and then to accept it. in lieu of the bill that came from committee. or. if the senate can effectively amend the substitute so as to suit it. it has the right to reject it. then we shall again revert to the committee bill. to which amendments will lie. and that bill can be put in shape. i believe it is the duty of those of us who desire to bring about the result within a reasonable period of time. in view of the distinguished auspices under which the substitute is presented to us. to address ourselves to it. and to do so promptly and with what i hope will prove to be good effect. the things that i think are eworthy as well as the things that give us concern are the following: it is eworthy that the socalled 60percent escape clause has  been taken out of the substitute. this is most gratifying and represents. again. what we all feel about the senator from illis [mr. dirksenj. he is  a slave even to his own ideas. but may be persuaded. either in the interest of harmony or of the basic substantive questions involved. that some other course is the right one. i believe that this has helped greatly in our consideration of the measure. the second thing that i think is important is that there has  been an acceptance. obviously. of the triggering mechanisms which are contained in the bill as it came from committee. this. again. represents a basic question of principle. which has  been accepted upon reconsideration by the leadership. to the effect that in order to have an effective law. which will at long last bring the right to vote to so many people who have been denied it. it is necessary to have mechanisms which will take effect within the control of the attorney general and the governmental machinery of the united states. subject to court review. but  subject to original authority on the part of the courts. that. i believe. is a distinct gain.  i should like to mention the disadvantages. the first and obvious one is the reversal of the provision which allowed the attorney general to require that an applicant attempt to register before the local authority. first. as the bill  reads. such an attempt is required unless waived by the attorney general. much as i prefer the former. i would  necessarily. if everything else fell into place. niggle about the latter. therefore. subject to the rest of the bill being put in reasonable condition. i should  think that that would represent a major problem. however. i regard the poll tax question as a major problem. and i regard the poll watchers question as a major problem. as to the poll tax. as it is  provided for in the substitute. we are deprived of a finding by congress as to the facts. i am one of those who believe that the facts justify the finding that the poll tax has been used as an instrument for abridging the right to vote. if congress is to leave it to the courts. either under pending or new cases. or even directing the attorney general to institute cases. it still means that he would have the burden of proof and must demonstrate affirmatively. absent a basic finding of fact by congress that it is of such nature that on its face it abridges the right to vote. so i do  agree with the strong feeling of many that the poll tax should  be eliminated. when we consider that what congress thought it was doing. it did  in fact accomplish when it passed the constitutional amendment with respect to the poll tax. i never say. and i shall   say. "i told you so." we are just about where we began before we dealt with the constitutional amendment. passed it. and had it ratified by the necessary number of states. the poll tax still exists. and exists substantially in the states that want it. i do  believe we ought to handicap ourselves. therefore. by avoiding an opportunity to remove the poll tax based upon a congressional finding of fact. i sincerely hope. as we move along in the effort to amend the substitute. that probably the primary question. the most controverted question with respect to the bill. may be resolved in an affirmative way by congressional finding and the elimination of the poll tax. and that the right of review by the courts may be included. i. am the first to agree that that should be. so that the situation may be protected in the event decisions occur which go against our point of view. withstanding our finding of fact.
. i am grateful to the majority leader for allowing me to precede him. although he could claim priority to the floor. the distinguished senator from massachusetts has made an eloquent argument concerning a number of the major questions which are before us. i shall  in this presentation duplicate. so far as i can avoid it. anything that he has said. partly because it would waste the time of the senate. but. even more importantly. because it would derogate from the degree of excellence which has characterized his presentation. i should like to deal with a few other matters in respect to the bill. first and foremost. let us have our eye on the objective. for it seems very clear that the poll tax has been a materially inhibiting factor against voting. the four states which still have the poll tax and which would be subject to the law. if this amendment were adopted. are among the six states which have the lowest percentages of voting participation in the nation. of the four states which have the very lowest percentages of citizens of voting age actually voting. three are poll tax states. the other one is only slightly higher in the ranking than that. so it seems to me that the first thing we had better keep our eye on is that the lowest ranking states in the nation in terms of voting participation. by and large. are poll tax states. second. and very important. is the size. in proportion to general population. of the negro population in those four states. again. that is a critically important factor in considering what we should do about the poll tax. finally. the feeling of congress. the feeling of the courts. and the feeling of the country seems to be one of general. universal agreement about. one thing. that we do  want to deprive anyone of his voting right. it was most interesting to me. as i read the debates incident to senatorial action on the 24th amendment. which was adopted and became a part of the constitution only a short time ago. that there was a feeling on the part of all southern senators and all thern senators--everybody. including those in the middlethat the one thing we did  want to do was to inhibit the right to vote. there is an eloquent statement by the supreme court which is well worth remembering in that connection. in the case of harman against forssenius. the recent virginia case. in which the court repeats what it said in the case of reyds against sims: the right to vote freely for the candidate of ones choice is of the essence of a democratic society. and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. so point  1 is that the poll tax states are among the lowest in terms of voting participation. point  2 is that there seems to be a universal feeling on the part of the country that the right to vote is the one thing we can all agree that we want to sustain and preserve. we come  to the 24th amendment. which seemed to bespeak the broad consensus of the country that the poll tax should be done away with. but the 24th amendment has  done away with the poll tax. that is precisely one of the most critical points for consideration at this time. withstanding the ponderous machinery of a constitutional amendment. withstanding the feeling that the poll tax should be banned in respect to federal elections. it was then said that it was unnecessary to apply the ban to state and local elections. so the poll tax persists and is an abridgment of the right to vote. even after the enactment of the 24th amendment. that is a serious situation. because many people like myself argued. long before the 24th amendment was considered. that the way to deal with the poll tax was by statute. that if it were dealt with by constitutional amendment. it would be necessary to deal with it across the board. the constitutional amendment should have eliminated the poll tax for state and local elections as well as for federal elections. it seems to me that having learned our lesson. after being led down what appears to be. without any criticism of its proponents. the garden path of the 24th amendment. it is high time for us to have the courage to face our responsibilities and . at long last. ban the poll tax. lock. stock. and barrel. root and branch. as a lawyer. i k it is  necessary to prove everything that one might be able to prove in order to prevail in a case. so it is egh. withstanding so much other evidence which exists. to say the following: whatever has been the case until recent years. the record is irrefutable that in recent years the poll tax. like the literacy test device. has been used as a means for perpetuating the abridgment or denial of the right to vote. egh instances. in the cases. the decisions of the courts. the findings of the federal civil rights commission. the findings of the attorney general. and the facts published in the press. have been demonstrated to make a solid. factual case that the poll tax. in the way it has been administered and in itself. represents an unconstitutional abridgment of the right to vote. if one proved hing else. and incorporated in a congressional finding what i have just stated. which is exactly what is done by the amendment. he would have egh upon which to base a poll tax ban. in that respect. i should like to refer to the recent case sustaining the constitutionality of the civil rights act of 1964. the case of katzenbach against mcclung. which reads. in part. as follows: where we find that the legislators. in light of the facts and testimony before them. have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce. our investigation is at an end. substitute for the word "commerce" the words "the voting right as guaranteed by the 15th amendment." and the sentence would then read: where we find that the legislators. in light of the facts and testimony before them. have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of the voting right as guaranteed by the 15th amendment. our investigation is at an end. so if we do hing but establish this factual basis and ban the poll tax on that basis. it seems to me that we would be proceeding upon perfectly sound constitutional ground. * it is well kn that i joined the senator from massachusetts in proposing this amendnient to the .committee on the judiciary. i did  do it lightly. but i did it in pursuance of an opinion.  arrived at then and there in the committee. but entertained by me for years. that the poll tax could be eliminated by legislative action of congress. in 1960. i proposed exactly that as an amendment to the civil rights bill then being considered. 37 senators agreed with me at that time. in 1962. i made a similar proposal in respect to the proposed 24th amendment then before the senate. and at that time 34 senators agreed with me. it is highly significant that the house of representatives passed a ban against the poll tax on five successive occasions prior to the -time when it joined in the proposal to submit the 24th amendment to the states. it seems to me that we are dealing.  with a problem that someone just recognized. but with a matter with which we have been struggling for years. and which we have even disapproved by constitutional amendment. but which still eludes us. it is for these reasons that i believe that a ban. and hing else. will do. that is why this amendment frankly and directly faces the issue by undertaking to legislate a bana ban  against taxes but against enforcing taxes with the denial of the right to vote. a highly pertinent question was asked the senator from massachusetts by the senator from kentucky lmr. cooper]. the question was this: if we claim that a literacy test is abused and used as a means for inhibiting the right to vote and therefore seek to prevent its use for that purpose. but do  ban it generally. why do we feel that the poll tax. which is similarly used as a means to abridge the right to vote. must be banned entirely. i believe the answer is this: in the first place. a tax must be equally applied. therefore. it is difficult to deal with the ban of a tax in particular subdivisions of a state. let us say. it presents real problems and may involve other aspects of the constitution. assuming that we deal effectively with the basic protection against abridgment of the right to vote. a second point in that respect is even more important and persuasive. for when we are dealing with a literacy test. we can say honestly that we are dealing with a qualification for voting. in my judgment. the congress has the power to override the states mal constitutional authority to establish qualifications for voting when the exercise of that authority has. in our judgment. resulted in abridgment of the right to vote under the 15th amendment. that is what we should establish. but. in my judgment. the poll tax is  a qualification for voting. it is an exercise of taxing authority which is designed and intended to abridge the right to vote. we are  dealing with a constitutional qualification. but with the exercise of a taxing power for the unconstitutional purpose of abridging the right to vote. therefore. in order to strike at the poll tax in an appropriate manner. we must eliminate it.- we can base our argument on whether a qualification is being reasonably used. because it is  a qualification. that is the great difference 6etween the way in which a literacy test is treated in the bill and the way in which a poll tax is treated in the bill. it is critically important that this be made clear to all.
i agree with the statement of the senator. the point i have just made with respect to the poll tax  being a qualification. but being rather an exercise of taxing power for an unconstitutional purpose. properly rests on both the 14th and 15th amendments. if the taxing power were to be used in order to abridge the right to vote on grounds of race or color. regardless of how the tax was administered. we would still have a course of action that would be contrary to the 15th amendment. if the taxing power were used in such a way as to prejudice irremediably the ecoic wellbeing of a class of citizens. whether white or negro. there would be a violation of the 14th amendment involving the denial of the right to equal protection of the laws. i have already stated the attitude of the court with regard to the acceptance of a congressional finding. as. for example. in the case of the public accommodations title of the civil rights act of 1964. based upon the factual proof. it seems to me that there would be a violation of a combination of both the 14th and 15th amendment. and we would have a firm constitutional basis for the ban of the poll tax.
. this brings me to the last point which i shall make this aftern. regarding what is being done in the mansfielddirksen substitute bill and why that is  sufficient to deal with the situation. an examination of section 9(a) of the substitute bill shows two things: first. the poll tax obviously was on the minds of the drafters. this was entirely due to the arguments. debate. and evidence presented before the judiciary committee. we could  sweep the issue under the rug.  could we forget it. the 24th amendment was on the books and there was excuse because it had  done the whole job. the poll tax was still being exacted for state and local elections. with just the same net effect on negro voter participation as before. congress had to do something about it. it would be a disgrace to do hing about it in a voting rights bill .
i am delighted to hear that. i welcome it. it is a very fine thing. i still feel. with all due respect to the senator. that it does  invalidate the point that four out of five states have  done so. withstanding so solemn an act as the 24th amendmentand i am the first to give the greatest credit to the senator from florida for originating that amendment. piloting it through the senate. and having it adopted. i am  in any way derogating from that achievement. i only say that of the five states which had a poll tax. four still continue to enforce it. that therefore it is  an extreme argument to maintain that. in the main. the situation remains the way we found it. i would be the last to deny that the 24th amendment means something. and was of some help. as the senator properly states. we believe that the poll tax has  been successfully eliminated in arkansasand arkansas has been taken out from under the billbut it still persists in the four other states. as to alabama. ± welcome very much the fact that it would even save the litigation which we are contemplating. either under the pending amendment or under the substitute bill. if the state of alabama itself eliminated the poll tax. hing would make me happier. but i still say that it constitutes argument against adoption of the ban . for this reason: we have dealt with this question of timing in regard to civil rights time and time again. it seems to me that by . after the civil rights acts of 1957. 1960. and 1964. congress has come to the conclusion that in an area in which it can act in this field. it should act and  wait for the long periods of time required for the affected states to act under the internal dynamics which might occur in those states. it may be that over long periods of time such a process would work. but the inhibition to voting which is represented by the poll tax. as part of the total pattern of inhibitions to voting by negroes which exists in these areas. makes it. in our judgmentwith all respect to the right of the senator from florida to disagree with meunwise in the interest of the nation to wait any longer before we deal with this subject. (at this point mr. holland took the chair as presiding officer.)
. as i was saying as to the comparison between the pending amendment and the substitute bill which is before us. the bill does  even make a finding of fact with respect to the poll tax. all it does is take account of the fact that some evidence was produced before the judiciary committee. and upon that evidence it asks the attorney general to go to court. it says to the attorney general that he is to institute in the name of the united states actions for declaratory judgment or injunctive relief against the enforcement of the poll tax. it does  even give a court the benefit of a congressional finding. and yet implicit in what it is saying in section 9(a) is a congressional finding. otherwise. why do we have to tell the attorney general what to do. it seems to me that there is an implication also that if we are  ready to make the finding. we are  convinced about the situation. first. there is an absence even of a finding in the substitute bill offered by the majority leader and the miity leader with respect to the poll tax. i do  see how we can get away from that. after the attorney general testified that it would seem to him proper to make a congressional finding that the poll tax is being used to abridge the right to vote. secondly. if we make such a finding. we should have the courage of our convictions. having made a finding which justifies the bar. we should go ahead and impose the ban. and that is what we seek to do in the amendment. finally. we say that we are  proceeding in an arbitrary way. in our amendment we ask the attorney general to move promptly to obtain injunctive relief to prevent enforcement orand i emphasize thisthreatened enforcement of the poll tax in violation of the ban congress places on it. therefore. congress will make its factual finding and will have the courage of its own findings. and will then get a prompt judicial determination as to whether what it did was right. in the event that that determinationand our amendment even deals with this possibilityshould go against us. we then put into effect the machinery with respect to the payment of the poll tax which was originally in the administration bill. with respect banning a requirement of payment of more than the current years taxes. it seems to me that we could  possibly be more reasonable and fair in this regulatory scheme. we have taken every consideration into the compass of our amendment and have provided for it. and we have had the courage of our convictions. it is for those reasons that i hope very much the senate will support this long overdue and highly desirable amendment.
. as i heard. the attorney general indicated that there was a finding of fact in the leadership substitute that the poll tax was used to abridge the right to vote. with all respect. i do  find that. i read from page 14. on which it specifically states. lines 8 to 10: in view of evidence presented to the congress that the constitutional right of citizens of the united states to vote is denied or abridged in some states by the requirement of the payment of a poll tax as a condition of voting in state or local elections and to assure that such right is  denied or abridged in violation of the constitution. the attorney general shall forthwith instituteand so forth. it seems to me that that is  a finding of fact. it is hing but the recital of a fact that evidence has been presented. but it does  find. on the part of congress. a fact. i call attention to page 2 of the amendment of the senator from massachusetts . which does find a fact. it is contained in section 9 (a). and reads: congress hereby declares that to prohibit the collection of a poll tax or other tax payment as a precondition of voting is necessary to secure the rights guaranteedand so forth. i am  trying to tax the majority leader. because. as he has frankly stated. he is  a lawyer. but i would like. through him. to put the question to the attorney general. we have until monday to do it. the question is. does the attorney general sincerely contend that there is a finding of fact in the leadership substitute. if he does. i do  find it.
. to supplement what the junior senator from massachusetts has just stated. i refer to the record of my previous efforts to have this matter dealt with by statute. on february 2. 1960 and on march 27. 1962. i moved the senate to eliminate the poll tax by statutory amendment. on both occasions. the socalled amendment was before the senate. on february 2. 1960. my motion was tabled by a vote 50 to 37. on march 27. 1962. it was tabled by a vote of 59 to 34. i point that out because it bears so heavily on what we are attempting to do here. at that time. i pointed out that the poll tax was  a qualification. qualifications come after the poll tax is paid. i pointed out that it is a tax. it is a tax burdening the right of an individual to cast a vote. that is unlawful under the 15th amendment. congress has the right to eliminate the poll tax by statute. that. in essence. is the argument which we have made here. the breedlove case has been cited. the breediove case is  an authority. the question was  raised in that case. in view of the timing of the decision. we did  get into the mainstream of the civil rights decisions until 1954 which indicates that the factual basis has  been laid for the courts to find that such a statute is constitutional. i thought we should have that statement to complete the answer to the argument made by the senator from mississippi.
as a practical matter. we have made the distinction very clear in the amendment that we are dealing with a poll tax as a prerequisite to voting. other than the four states involved. states have head taxes.
in the first place. 1902 is a far cry from 1965. it is a small question of 63 years. there have been many iniquitous practices in voting in many parts of the country. including my native state. which have occurred in modern times. the period around 1890 and through 1902 was a period when the poll tax and other means to restrict the voting right came upon the scene. it was very unfortunate that it should have come at that time. it marked a new attitude on the part of the south toward the negro franchise. i k that the senator from texas feels very strongly about the voting right. i understand his views about the poll tax. but that historic point must be made. finally. our contention is  only under the 15th amendment provisions with respect to a direct factual showing of inhibition in voting. but also we think that practices have been shown to be widespread egh to justify the congress in acting. even if they do  occur in many places in texas. some have contended that the head tax is an imposition of a burden amounting to an abridgment of the right to vote. and also violates both the 14th and 15th amendments in and of itself. if used as a prerequisite for voting and an ecoic standard. i think the record should be complete on that score.
i do  believe that what we are doing would have any effect on a property qualification for voting in local bond elections. frankly. i would  be prepared to engage the senatorin any discussion of the law on that subject without king exactly what it is we are talking about. but i do  believe that anything that we are attempting to do in banning the poll tax would deal with that question.
. the fact that the poll tax in that particular state was being used to abridge the right to vote under the 15th amendment would have to be proved at least in every state. so we would have at least four major litigations. but we might have a great many more based on varying sets of fact. that. it seems to me. is the absolutely decisive point in respect of both the finding and the ban. so i sum up as follows: we have borne the burden on the facts. we have borne the burden on the law in terms of constitutionality. and we have demonstrated that what is offered to us will  do the job. would it  be the crowning anachronism if. having sought to do something about the voting right. which everyone agrees ought to be safeguarded and preserved. we omitted the removal of this impossible anachronism of a poll tax. i do  see how we can fulfill our obligation if we fail to do that and say that we have enacted an effective bill to safeguard the right to vote. i hope the senate will approve the amendment.
. my deep and longstanding interest in the remarkable ecoic progress of puerto ricoand i speak as a senator who represents more than 600.000 americans of puerto rican origin who make their homes in my statehas been quickened by my recent appointment to the united statespuerto rico commission on the status of puerto rico. therefore. i was very much pleased to have brought to my attention a statement containing some truly impressive statistics and comparisons. gathered by the resident commissioner of the commonwealth of puerto rico. the hoable santiago polancoabreu. regarding the great and increasing role that puerto rico plays as a customer of the united states. according to these statistics. in the fiscal year 1964. the purchases of puerto rico from new york state alone amounted to an estimated $141 million. generating directly about 16.000 jobs in the state. from the mainland united states as a whole. puerto rico bought almost $114 billion worth of goodsranking after canada. japan. the united kingdom. and west germany. as our fifth best customer. i ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed in the record.
it will have. we k the problem that arises in some states from discrimination in voting. the state of vermont. however. is collecting roughly $1 million or so in taxes based upon the right to vote. that state could very easily levy a capitation tax upon every vermonter who votesbut  as a condition for voting. vermont could collect exactly the same amount of money with little difficulty and without in any way running afoul of what we might deal with here in terms of litigation by the attorney general. the pending amendment would distort everything that we are trying to do in the bill in relation to the poll tax. that would be done so that vermont would  have to amend its law which imposes a capitation tax on individuals. and uses it as a condition on the individuals right to vote.. that is really what we are asked to do. and we might as well realize it. i do  believe that is fair to the people of the united states. we are trying to protect the right to vote. the amendment is shooting at a very small target. which can very adequately be dealt with by the state of vermont itself. well within the context of the bill. thereby depriving us of a very major weapon in the struggle against the poll tax where it is used in order to deny or abridge the right to vote. that is what i believe the proposal amounts to. i hope that the senate will  take the amendment lightly. with the attitude that "the senators from vermont are agreeable and distinguished senators and we love them dearlyand i join in that sentimentso let us do it for them." that is the way a great many things happen in the senate. unless other senators do what the senator from michigan . the senator from kentucky [mr. cooperl. and i have been trying to do.
i see hing whatever that would prevent the state of vermont from levying a sanction on a person who does  pay a tax. in new york citizens are required to pay a fee in order to obtain a drivers license. why could  drivers be required to pay x dollars in addition in order to obtain a drivers license. the tax carries with it the point that if a man has voted. he has incurred a liability for the tax. the process is perhaps a very good way for the state of vermont to raise revenue. i do  see why vermont could  obtain its money very effectively and efficiently and in way come under the inhibitions of the law. if we would leave the language in the bill exactly as it is  written in the bill.
. i wish to sum up. for the benefit of senators who may have been absent from the floor when the matter was first considered and debated. the situation we face with respect to the pending amendment. the pending amendment would attach to section 9(a)-the section  dealing with the direction to the attorney general to contest the constitutionality of the poll tax as a precedent to voting in state or local electionsa restriction that he should bring such actions only in cases in which the purpose or effect of the levying of the tax as a condition to voting would be the denial or abridgment of the right to vote on the ground of race or color. that would restrict the attorney general to the bringing of such cases only in situations in which he alleges that the 15th amendment is being violated by means of the poll tax. as a practical matter. we can stop the court from ruling that something is unconstitutional on any ground contained in a suit which is properly in court. however. this section deals with the direction which we propose to give to the attorney general. it seems to me that we should  restrict the authority of the attorney general to the bringing of suits in which the poll tax is made a condition to voting. it is possible that the courts may decide that the poll tax represents. on ecoic grounds. a tax on the right to vote. and therefore. contravenes the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. the courts may also decide that the poll tax represents a denial or abridgement. as a factual matter under the 15th amendment. of the right to vote on the ground of race or color. it does  seem to me. as we are attempting to deal with whether poll taxes are constitutional. that we ought to restrict the kind of litigation in which the attorney general should engage in to test this matter. this. it seems to me. becomes especially important because of the very vigorous struggle which was waged on the amendment to ban the poll tax. a great many senators opposed that amendment. they made the argument that if a ban on the poll tax were voted into the bill. it would delay. rather than accelerate. a constitutional test through a suit of the attorney general. it was pointed out that the attorney general. because of the provisions of section 9(a). would then move into court to deal with the poll tax as a condition to voting generically under all sections and all constitutional questions. it was further pointed out that. therefore. a decision would be arrived at with the greatest celerity. whereas a ban of the poll tax would raise individual questions in the individual states or political subdivisions and thereby tend to delay a court test. if we were to include this amendment in the bill. we would be eroding the very thing upon which we may assume that at least some senators relied in voting against the poll tax ban. we would be fractionalizing the litigation brought by the attorney general. the attorney general could sue only in cases in which we could specifically demonstrate that the poll tax had the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on the ground of race or color. that would raise a factual question in every case. it could raise the question county by county. as the report of the u.s. civil rights commission indicates. we would therefore break down completely whatever validity exists in the argument that through one broad approach to the question. there would be a prompt court decision and the question would be settled. as i indicated before. and shall repeat for the benefit of senators who were  present. this is all done. according to the two senators from vermontboth of whom we all respect highlyto preserve the exact manner in which the state of vermont has been levying this tax. it seems clear to me that the tax can be levied upon those who do vote as a capitation tax. perhaps other conditions may be set. one of the senators from vermont pointed out that a condition for obtaining an automobile license is the payment of this tax. that is a rather effective way to collect the tax. if there must be some modest amendment to the law of vermont. how can that be compared with the serious question raised here. i believe that in the attempt to obtain one comprehensive decision from the u.s. supreme court as to the validity of the poll tax under the applicable provisions of the constitutionwhich would include the 14th and 15th amendmentswe are aiming at a very small target with a very big gun. we should most respectfully ask our friends from the state of vermontwhich certainly is among the leading states of the country in terms of dealing equitably and justly may 1.3. 1965 with the issue of discrimination and segregationto make a modest change in their statute. vermont is one of the great states in the union. the state of vermont is  using its law with a view to denying or abridging the right of the negro to vote. vermont can make a change in its own statute in order to accommodate a broader purpose. a fundamental and basic attack upon this issue could be by means of section 9(a). and  by means of this amendment which would cause a proliferation of suits and thus destroy the fundamental purpose sought to be attained. which is one broad determination on a major issuethe constitutionality of the poll tax as a condition to voting. it is for those reasons that i feel the amendment should be defeated. with all due respect and affection for my colleagues. the senator proposes to make a very material change which would be deleterious and prejudicial to the objective which we sought to attain and which remains to be attained by the provision in the bill. in the struggle to deal with the anachronism of the poll tax at long last.
i would  say that he would. because we are dealing with a definition of what is meant by a denial or abridgment of the right to vote. it is doubtful that the court or the attorney general would move in cases of the character mentioned. it is rather doubtful that the attorney general would move in any case involving vermont in that connection. if i were the attorney general. i would  do it. i do  believe it has any relationship to the basic intention here in passing the bill. but by including the amendment we would be channeling the kind of cases that might be brought. resulting in a proliferation of cases. brought in such a way as to impair reaching the areas where the payment of a poll tax has been used to deny the right to vote. withstanding the direction of congress. it is still the attorney general who must make the case. i do want congress. in dealing with a specialized situation. which could. at worst. be dealt with by state law to destroy the only thing we have left in the poll tax area which has some fundamental direction to the attorney general as to the kind of case we want to reach. for that reason. i hope senators who favor the bill will vote against the amendment.
. i shall first address myself to the essence of what we are trying to do and why. and then deal with the specialized interest of certain senators who feel that their states are peripherally affected by the proceedings contained in this record and by the poll tax provisions of the bill. first. on the essence of the matter. let us remember that we were defeated in our effort to ban the poll tax. if we were to ban the poll tax. states which have a beneficient poll tax. such as vermont and perhaps coloradoalthough i do  believe that colorado would come within that definitionwould then change their laws in order to collect the same tax. except that the right to vote would  be conditioned on prepayment of the tax. in vermont. for example. payment of the tax could be a precondition to obtaining an automobile license. in that case. we would be dealing with a revenue situation. i have always had grave doubts as to whether revenue situations in states such as colorado and 18 other statesas has been mentionedwould even come within the meaning of the term "poll tax." however. be that as it may. our amendment banning the poll tax was rejected. we are  talking about a different proposition. and it is that matter that i wanted to develop.
. i stated then and i state  that i do  believe that was encompassed within the meaning of the term "poll tax." in vermont. the situation is different. i thoroughly agree with the majority leader. as one who has been active in connection with the pending measure. i join in the statement that the poll tax concept excludes the kind of situation to which the senator from colorado has reference. there are some aspects of the question that i believe apply. even in my state. when the authorities undertake to install some kind of sewer or sanitation project in which the neighboring owner must join. it may very well be that they must agree to pay their part of the cost. i believe that we get into permutations which are quite apart from the poll tax issue. i believe that the words "poll tax" are used as words of art. the question of whether congress shall make a finding of fact with regard to the ban of poll tax is  under consideration. in order to make a finding of fact. we must have some basis of fact. it seems to me that the basis of fact is established by a composite of pending cases and findings which have been made before the origin of the poll tax. the purposes were frankly stated in states which adopted the poll tax. if we needed a declaration. we have one in the following statement issued by the civil rights commission prior to its definitive report on the results of its hearings on voting in the state of mississippi: the requirement of any poll tax payment as a prerequisite to voting in any election should be abolished. in view of the fact that poll taxes have been intended and utilized as a means of discrimination in violation of the 15th amendment. in the opinion of the commission. there can be reasonable doubt of the power of congress to enact such a provision as an exercise of the power expressly granted to congress to enforce the 15th amendment. reference can be made to the debate as shown in the record for may 7. 1965. at page 9920. and those that follow. in which case after case was cited in which allegations were made that the poll tax was being used to discriminate in voting because local officials do  have to take the tax. and if they do . a negro trying to pay it is denied the right to vote. i mention also the findings of the judiciary committee going back to 1953 to which reference was made in this debate in which it was found as a fact. after hearings. that the poll tax was used as a means of discrimination. i refer also to the citations made by the senator from massachusetts . the sponsor of the banning amendment. showing how the poll tax was endemically built into a situation which. based on ecoics. was discriminatory. in addition. i quote from the 1959 report of the u.s. commission on civil rights. which i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point as a part of my remarks. but first i quote from it: between 1889 and 1908. the former confederate states passed laws or amended their constitutions to erect new barriers around the ballot box. the most popular were (1) the poll taxand so forth.
the reason for using the figures for median income is that it buttresses that finding of fact. because where there is  that disparity in certain states. on ecoic grounds. the poll tax does  work to abridge the right to vote. but the very clause the senator referred to deals with denial or abridgment of the right to vote in certain states by reason of that fact. that gives the court a clue as to our selectivity. we were running across the board.  we are dealing with a finding of fact which has been made with respect to states where there is that disparity and where the original record of the purpose of having adopted the poll tax shows that it was for the purpose of restricting the right to vote. it seems to me that the finding of fact is so clearly selective that the courts will be selective. as we call upon them to be. especially because we have lost on our earlier attempt for a complete ban. i do  believe we can color that at all. we have lost on the basic proposition of a ban across the board. i therefore conclude that the finding of fact will enable the courts to act in situations in which basis the right to vote is being actually abridged or denied by virtue of the utilization of the poll tax and it will as was the intent of the ban upon which we lostresult in poll taxes across the board being banned. it may very well be that in some other state. other than in the four states to which i have referred in this discussion. the courts will find in fact that the poll tax does work as an abridgment of the right to vote in an unequal way. if it does. then the result will follow. but the result will follow anyhow. whether we said so here or . hence. the finding of fact buttresses the capability of the courts to act. but does . as would the ban. compel the courts to act. we have given sufficient evidence of our desire to be selective so that. in my judgment. the courts which pass upon the matter will be selective. i close by pointing out that this proposed amendment is  the optimum for me. perhaps that is why i am in the best position to speak. i believe and still believe that the poll tax should have been banned. that it is an anachronism in american life and an improper burden upon the right to vote. but i lost. so. . i am proud to interpret what is before the senate. and what is before the senate is selective in its character and quality. that is the way i understand it.
 of the united states. mr. shriver so informed me. i see other alternative than to have congress declare its intention on this subject. one of the jobs is bound to suffer. the one statement that i want to be clear on the record is that i am hopeful that the amendment may be accepted by the senator in charge of the bill. i want to state my feelings about mr. shriver. as a public servant. he is one of the best. that is the very reason why he should be given every chance to do the new job that he has accepted without being torn apart in an attempt to perform the old job at the same time.
 and of our aid organization to african ecoic development. to encourage african ecoic development through regional development institutions. including the newly created african development bank. and to maximize. to the greatest possible extent. the channeling of free world ecoic aid to africa through african regional development institutions on the basis of selfhelp and mutual cooperation. in proposing this amendment i want to make it entirely clearand this is evident from the statistics i cited previouslythat. in my view. the principal responsibility for free world ecoic assistance to africa rests with europe. with the united states taking a "miity position." differing in that way from the role played by the united states in latin america. in presenting the amendment. i made it clear to the senator from arkansas. that i would make my position clear on this point. african nations are making great progress in the field of ecoic and social development through selfhelp. despite great handicaps of low income. lack of infrastructure. illiteracy. and disease. examples cited by gover williams. assistant secretary of state for african affairs. during the course of testimony presented before the house foreign affairs committee on february 10 of this year clearly illustrate this: first. in recent years liberia. ethiopia. and nigeria have been able to increase their gross national product by 4 to 5 percent annually. second. agricultural production for the entire continent has risen 25 percent in the past 10 years. third. african exports have increased 45 percent in the same period of time. fourth. oil production in libya and nigeria has increased sharply in the last 4 years. fifth. the u.n. ecoic commission for africa is one of the most active and most effective of the u.n. regional bodies. its activities in planning for african development auger well for the future. for example: (a) the eca fathered the african development bank established last year. (b) the eca is cooperating with african nations in planning regionally integrated programs in such fields as transportation. telecommunications. and industrialization. by assisting the advancement of regional development institutionsthrough technical assistance. projects financed in cooperation with the african development bank. with international lending organizations. and with european nations we can make possible effective selfhelp and mutual cooperation in africa. we are doing that very successfully in latin america. i believe the time has come to direct the attention of the administration toward that concept in africa. i have submitted the amendment to aid and have redrafted it in terms which are satisfactory to them. i hope very much that the chairman of the committee. who has such a great interest in this particular area. may consider the amendment worthy and will take it to conference.
. i invite attention to the fact that this bill represents the culmination of the longstanding struggle to eliminate two excise tax problems which have affected our peoplefirst. one affecting the producers or manufacturers of luggage and handbags. and second. the fur industry. the excise tax has had a damping effect on those industries and an adverse effect on consumers. it is gratifying that. at long last. the wisdom of these actions has been recognized. when former senator keating was in the senate. he tried many timesas did ito rid the industry of these depressing factors. it has  been done. and done completelyand i am pleased with it. i k that the removal of these excise taxes will be of great benefit to the industries involved and will help the governments tax revenues much more by the stimulation it will give to the two industries than would result from the vexatious excise taxes which were imposed.
. i am a cosponsor of the pastore amendment and support it. i believe that the full faith and credit of the united states is pledged behind every coin. as it is behind every paper dollar. that is the reason why people use the coinage as they use paper dollars for exchange purposes. they do  use coins because they have specifically designated silver content. i believe that the arts. commerce. and industry would be well served by agreeing to the amendment.
subsequently said: . when the labor and public welfare committee considered the senate bill. s. 1566. which parallels the bill  being considered. i raised a point which i believe deserves some emphasis at this stage. as the committee report indicates. the purpose of both bills is to extend the juvenile delinquency act of 1961 beyond the end of the next fiscal year. the demonstration projects under this act have served as the basis for the heart of the antipoverty program. the community action program. most of those demonstration projects are  being shifted to the antipoverty program for funding. four are remaining as sources of research data under the juvenile delinquency act for at least the short run. the agency indicates that these remaining four will soon become antipoverty programs under the jurisdiction of the office of ecoic opportunity. and this is the result which the committee expects in order to avoid duplication of effort and administration. however. apart from the remaining four demonstration projects. the main function of the office of juvenile delinquency in the department of health. education. and welfare will be the continuation of its programs to develop trained personnel who can staff antipoverty and juvenile delinquency projects. the lack of such personnel is becoming more and more acute as the antipoverty effort gets underway. so that this function will become even more central than it has been. to date. the juvenile delinquency program has been funding some 12 training institutes. which have been set up at colleges and universities around the country. it is also financing curriculum development for such training. in the course of our committees hearings on this measure. it became apparent that many of those most directly concerned with the juvenile delinquency control field believe that these training functions could be expanded to fill a serious need if the funds were available. i received telegrams from a number of academic and social work sources indicating that there was a need for increasing the $2 million training budget which was included in the $6.5 million overall request in s. 1566 as introduced. upon inquiry. i was advised that in fact almost twice as much could be used for this purpose effectively. accordingly. i offered an amendment. adopted by the committee. which increased the amount in the bill for fiscal year 1967 and 1968 to $8.3 million each. with the additional $1.8 million earmarked for the personnel training program. since then. the house of representatives has passed h.r. 8131. which extends the program for only 1 year. rather than the 2 years in the senate bill. but which increased the authorization for fiscal year 1967 to $10 million. i have been informed by the office of juvenile delinquency that this increase will include the additional $1.8 million earmarked for the training program. which was the subject of my amendment. the increase above that amount is for some additional special demonstration projects. it is most constructive that the training function will  become a central one for this program and that the juvenile delinquency program. which i have supported actively since its inception. will be continued. i hope that every effort will be made to convert the talent and data resulting from this program to use in the antipoverty program.
he is obliged to withhold it at that time. or even to advance it. based upon the estimate of tips. he has to advance the amount of the withholding. because the income tax affixes at the same time the social security tax obligation affixes.
. enactment of the bill will be a historic breakthrough. therefore. i hope that when the amendment is taken to conference. the senator in charge of the bill will bear in mind that many of us view the situation with deep disquiet. and that at the very least they will make some other disposition of the idea. putting it into the supplementary package would be. in my judgment. the sound way to approach the particular problem. that is the package which is based upon a voluntary contribution by the beneficiary and the government. that would  only cut its cost. but would also put it where it belongs. on the voluntary side. over and above the minimal program for which the government is. for all practical purposes. the underwriter as financed by social security taxes. i point out. too. that this program. in its basic part. is substantially viable and is. in fact. producing an excess in social security taxes over and above its costs. except for roughly 2 million. who are  under the social security system. for whom the federal government pays the bill. i hope that the managers of the bill. when they go into conference. will understand that if they bring back some reasonable resolution of this problem of catastrophic illness. preferably on the side of the bill which this amendment unfortunately does  affect. there are many of us who will support it. however. we see the bill going out with this amendment on it with the greatest disquiet. it is my intention to vote " on the voice vote that will ensue.
. it is easy to be entertained by passionate argument. however. one ought  necessarily to be persuaded by it. i should feel very disheartened if i were to permit the argument made by the junior senator from louisiana to stand unanswered. matter what follows. we have heard some rather astounding doctrines. one such doctrine deals with taxes. it has been said: "it is up to the individual to do what he wants to do." that is a rather unheard of proposition to be uttered in the senate of the united states. are we encouraging citizens to avoid their tax liability. or are we writing laws to enforce the payment of taxes. there is aher proposition which i have heard advanced here which i must say is rather el.
that is  strictly accurate. the employer pays wages. every time he pays wages. he must tell the internal revenue service what the employee has been paid. so it is  correct that everything we report is within our own control.
. i understand we are anxious to get on with the business of the senate and have the house cover the rates. but let us get some idea of what is involved. as i understand the amendment of the senator from florida. the social security tax rates are increased about onetenth of 1 percent. in general.
. i ice that. with relation to the struggle we carried on in the senate on the question of cash tips. there was a compromise. i ask the senator how the conferees expected that the social security funds would be affected by the fact that the employer is excused from the social security tax liability on such tips.
that last expression is very important. i k the employees would want to k and establish for the record that the additional benefits which they would receive by virtue of the social security tax on tips would  be provided. withstanding the free ride given to the employer.
. one of the most difficult and often frustrating jobs in government is that of a trade negotiator at the current kennedy round negotiations in geneva under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. bargaining sessions often are complex. highly technical. and lengthy. progress is slow and often uncertain. however. the results of these sessions are crucial to the expansion of world markets for both industrial and agricultural products of all trading countries. for his effective service in these vital negotiations. i wish to commend representative thomas b. curtis. of missouri. one of the four u.s. congressional delegates to the kennedy round and a colleague of mine on the joint ecoic committee. representative curtis recently returned from geneva with a thorough and optimistic report on the progress of the talks. which has helped to cast congress in a new role under the trade expansion act. in his column. roscoe drummond has also commended representative curtis for his contribution. and i ask unanimous consent that his column in the july 14 edition of the washington post be placed in the record at this point.
. $8 million was provided by appropriation in the last fiscal year for these activities. the senate committee has  cut that $8 million to $5 million. indeed. the senate committee improved upon the house figure by $1 million. the house committee had cut the request to $4 million. it still represents almost a 40 percent cut on the part of the subcommitteea cut  only from some budget bureau request. but from what was appropriated last year. the evidence found in the transcript of the hearings. given by authorities from the department of health. education. and welfare. at pages 750 through 764. indicates that the department spent what they were given last year. and that the department has demands for a good deal more money at the present time. dr. keppel testified. and i shall read part of his testimony because it is so important. it reads as follows: senator smith. if you dont get this money. what are you going to do.
i wish to reply to the comments which have been made. as follows: first. the senator from arkansas states that the committee tried to go more than halfway. second. that it is uncertain what the program contains. and let us see what the program can do before we appropriate more money. third. the budget bureau cut them from $15 to $8 million. as to the budget bureau cut from $15 to $8 million. that seems to me to be a steep cut. and then to be cut by 40 percent more in the senate. let that much stand if it is to be cut that steeply. as to "trying to go more than halfway." let us remember that what i am trying to do is to restore it.  to any budget request. even if the cut by the budget bureau was to last years appropriation. but it seems to me that is a rather hard rock proposition to tie to. the point i wish to talk about most is. "let us see what the program can do." we have seen what the program can do in the sense that the money was brought out after last year. the schedules which they filed show that their requests are materially increased over last year. so at best we will have cut down on the program . with the difficulties which have been mentioned. they k as much as i do about desegregating southern schools. suppose we spend $3 million for school people to back each other up and give each other a comprehension of the techniques and the strength required to desegregate schools in hostile communities. is that  worth it. how could we better spend money than to do it this way. instead of doing it under what these very same gentlemen have called coercion of law. which they hotly oppose for that reason. this is the element of the law which is constructive. this goes to school districts which wish to desegregate and which wish to get the best technique. what could be more constructive than that. how can there be a better opportunity than that kind of route. when this proposal was discussedand i remember it very well as an element of the civil rights act of 1964it was exactly what was said with respect to the institutes. with respect to technical assistance. and with respect to the inservice training. that we would have a new situation. to create given areas where we did  have the arm of the department of justice to start the suits. but where the areas themselves needed some assistance and help in getting to the point where they could themselves desegregate. referring again to dr. keppels testimony. we first cut down the program by 40 percent. unless we accept the amendment. there will be given them a million dollars to distribute. but to distribute on the backs of things already skimmed down to the bone. as he himself testified. i read from page 763 of the record. as follows:
. i ask unanimous consent that. at its next printing. the name of the senator from pennsylvania may be added as a cosponsor of the bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1954 to include the expenses incurred by employers in providing training and retraining programs for their. employees and prospective employees as expenses which qualify for the investment credit under section 38.
i did  hear the senator refer specifically to the u.s. travel service. in which i have a very great interest. as does the senator from washington . i iced the amount was cut from $3.200.000. as proposed by the senate. to $3 million. i realize it is fruitless to try to do something about it at this stage. but i rise toprotest would be the wrong word to use. but to call to the attention off my colleagues the fact that we are really missing a tremendous bet in this area and are engaging in what is a terribly wasted opportunity by these rather mi cuts. american tourists abroad are spending about one billion and a half dollars more than foreign tourists spend in this country. when the senator from washington sponsored the u.s. travel serviceand it was the first real effort to do something to deal with that situationwe created an agency which everybody admits is being very well operated. it covers only half of the problem. i am trying to have it extended to include domestic travel. laying that factor aside. for fiscal year 1966 usts requested an increase of $500.000 to increase the level of the u.s. effort to include foreigners to visit the united states. and thereby to reduce the deficit in our international balance of payments. which is accounted for by the socalled tourist "gap." the house refused that request and left usts appropriations at the fiscal year 1965 level. $3 million. to the senate. usts asked that we allow at least a $345.000 increase in its budget. the senate approved a $200.000 increase for the next fiscal year. however. the conferees finally agreed with the house and provided only $3 million for this agency. it seems to me we are being shortsighted to hold the appropriation down to the same appropriation for the fiscal year 1965. i k the senate provided more than is provided in the conference report for this item. and that is to the credit of the senate. i would appreciate any comment on the matter from the senator from arkansas.
as a result of the efforts of the agency there has been a material increase in tourism into the united states. i think the agency has more than adequate justification for its existence. on a budget that has reached $3 million only in fiscal year 1965. the usts has been largely responsible for increasing for foreign travel to the united states by 17 percent in 1962. 22 percent in 1963. and by over 30 percent in 1964. i would say to the senator from arkansas. and through him to the executive department. that with the encouragement the chairman of the subcommittee has given. i would hope the agency concerned. the department of commerce. the presidents office. and the bureau of the budget would show a little fight on this expenditure. it is well worth fighting for. i agree with the senator from arkansas that we have to fight for it. sufficient results have already been achieved to show that the agency requires a decent appropriation. i hopeand i am encouraged by what the chairman of the subcommittee has saidthat the executive department will look into the matter. there is a $1/2billlon imbalance in our payments due to the socalled travel gap. it is inconceivable to me. with the marvelous country we have. and the wonderful accommodations for tourists. that we can materially increase the progress we are making in attracting people to our country.
lest there be any mystery about this matter. i have an amendment which relates to the power of the president to suspend by proclamation the operation of the tax. it is important because if the balanceofpayments situation does  require the application -of the tax it becomes crucially important to american investors all over the world that they should  be subject to the tax merely because we have machinery to lift it. this is a mobile situation. the amendment also would give the president the power to reimpose the tax. there is desire to cut off executive authority. i understood that this amendment was something that i had to clear with the treasury. because the subject is something that we can deal with in the senate. as coming within our province. the amendment which i was asked to clear with the treasury department relates to a quite different matter. it relates to the acquisition of debt obligations arising out of certain lease transactions by american banks involving mainly aircraft. that is the amendment which i understand was agreeable to the treasury department. however. i will recheck it with them. i hope. therefore. that we can. as the senator from florida has expressed it. dispose of both amendments. i certainly shall cooperate to the extent that i can to achieve that end.
i agree with the senator. i am talking about surface indications. which are deceptive. that is why i want to give the president flexibility. in the face of the objection of the senator from delaware. i am thinking and i should like to consider the matter a little longer and hear other points of viewof the possibility of restricting the extension of the tax to 1 year beyond december 31. 1965. in addition. under the law. the president may also exempt individual countries. i pointed that out to the senator from delaware. it may be that a 1year extension plus the flexibility  in the law will serve the basic purposes i have in mind. that will. however. create the problem that the administration may have to ask for a repeal of this tax. but trying to get a congressional act repealed is pretty slow. and i would prefer that the president have the power. i believe that it would be in the national interest in a situation of this kind. i do  want to seem doctrinaire. i have laid my thoughts on the table to elicit a response from such thoughtful senators as the senator from ohio.
. i compliment my colleague the senator from indiana. on the care and attention which he is giving to this very grave problem. which concerns the ecoic condition of the world. i agree with him that we should  necessarily have a sharp recession and depression. though some form of correction in a free ecoy is always necessary. it is our duty to cushion its effect on the individual. i am strongly for that course of action. with the use of unemployment insurance. social security. manpower retraining. and the many other forms of help which we will make available and are making available to place a concrete base under the ecoy and to see that person in this country suffers. however. essentially. if we were wise and able. we could anticipate the swings and materially deal with them so that they would  have the sharp effect that they are always in danger of having. i believe. laying that aside. that they are far from perfect . we face a grave ecoic situation with respect to the british pound and the british ecoic situation. which could rock the world and bring us on a collision course with aher depression. i feel very much flattered that the senator approves of what i have done. but. above and beyond that. i welcome a strong ally such as the senator from indiana in what must be a most considered course of action which would take. in my judgment. a great deal of support from outside of britain to help in this very grave crisis in which our oldest. and in many ways. most productive ally. finds itself enmeshed. by means is it true that britain can help itself a great deal. however. it will need help from others and from the united states. it seems to me that the united states would help itself as well as the rest of the free world by a vivid cognizance of what is at stake. i hope that before very long. with the help of such distinguished senators as my colleague the senator from indiana. there will be a consensus and a crystallization of what the united states needs to do in terms of helping the united kingdom.
. i submit an amendment to section vii of the higher education act of 1965 . which is scheduled to be considered by the senate tomorrow. the housing and urban development act of 1965public law 89117--established an interest rate ceiling on college housing of 3 percent. my amendment applies the same formula to loans made under title iii of the higher education facilities act of 1963public law 88204. the amendment is effective after enactment of the higher education act. presently loans are charged an interest rate of 37/ percent. $120 million was appropriated for these loans for the current fiscal year. my amendment therefore would equalize the interest rate charged for construction of classrooms and other college facilities with that  charged for dormitory rooms and college housing. the office of education informs me that it has objection to the amendment.
. much attention and energy has been directed in recent years toward efforts. to strengthen the fiscal capacity of state and local governments to deal with significant problems of primary concern to them. the increasing need of local governments to remain financially viable and able to meet their fiscal responsibilities within the context of federalstate matching grant programs has highlighted the importance of insuring that local governments maintain sufficient sources of revenue. the socalled heller plan which calls for the redistribution of a certain percentage of federal tax revenues to the states according to a predetermined formula is one very interesting method of strengthening the states and local governments capacity to handle their own financial problems. i have been working on the outlines of such a formula and have been giving serious study to the question of the extent of the federal supervisory role. such a formula for redistribution of federal funds to the states ought. i believe. to take into consideration both the needs of the state. the size of the states own efforts to meet these needs. and the relationship of the states revenues to its overall needs. in its 1965 report. the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations concluded: the division of revenue sources among federal. state. and local governments does  match their relative revenue requirements. the states. and more particularly local governments. are disadvantaged in comparison with the national government. the disparity between their relative resources and revenue requirements. moreover. is  likely to decline. the effect of state tax and expenditure policy has many ramifications varying from its capacity to deal with necessary social services to the location of industry and ecoic development within its state. the stimulation of new fiscal capacity on the part of the states by use of the heller plan is. i believe. deserving of new and intensified efforts. i ask unanimous consent to include in the record at this point an article on the heller plan entitled a "republican opportunity" appearing in todays new york herald tribune.
point of departure has already been amply discussed by proponents of revenue sharing. the federal government. under conditions of high employment. will collect more tax moneys than it can wisely spend. the state and local governments will be spending more money than they can raise through efficient measures of taxation. both problemsthe embarrassing affluence of the federal government and the pressing needs of state and local governmentscan be neatly solved through a program of federal revenue sharing. in the senators thoughtful proposal. 1 percent of the current income tax baseabout $2.5 billionwould be deposited in a trust fund. the proceeds of the fund would then be allocated to the states. each year 80 percent would be distributed on the basis of population and 20 percent would be divided among the 12 or 15 states with lowest per capita incomes. the federal grants would be used only to support programs in the fields of health. education and welfare. this constraint would leave the states and localities ample freedom of action. while precluding the support of programs such as highway construction that are already heavily funded by the congress. the revenue sharing plan was first proposed by walter w. heller. former chairman of the council of ecoic advisers. but the president. seemingly piqued by a premature leak. has maintained an air of chilly disdain. it would be ironic indeed if this important proposal. the brainchild of a democrat. should become the property of the opposition. [from the washington post. sept. 22. 19651
. i send to the desk a bill to establish a taxsharing formula to distribute to the states and through them to local governments a portion of federal tax revenues. i ask unanimous consent that the bill lie on the desk for additional sponsors until close of business monday next. october 18. 1965. unless the senate adjourns sine die before that time. and that it lie on the desk until the senate does adjourn if sooner.
s council of ecoic advisers. it has since been endorsed by a task force of ecoists headed by joseph w. pechman. of the brookings institution. it was supported by the republican govers association last july as well as by numerous conferences of local officials. but concrete plan has yet been formulated as to the precise allocation of federal funds for a wide range of state activities. despite its complexity. i believe congress should have before it  a carefully drawn proposal embodying this plan so that it may be fully considered by congressional committees during the period between sessions and may be the subject for hearings early in the second session. state and local governments face a severe crisis. while the future with its demands for new services is rushing in on them. they remain victims of a financial revenue base which is years out of date. in the past 18 years. total state and local government expenditures have multiplied six times over. state and local outlays for education alone increased from $3 billion at the end of world war ii to $22 billion last year. in the past 10 years. these expenditures.  totaling about $87 billion per year. have risen at 8 percent per year. twice as fast as the gross national product. in contrast to this. the federal government made cash expenditures during fiscal year 1965. excluding costs of national defense. of $66 billion. the sad fact is that the present resources of state and local government are  sufficient to meet the expanding needs caused by exploding population. rapid urbanization. and advanced techogy.  is there any indication that this situation will correct itself. indeed. almost every imaginable tax resource has already been subjected to increasing and sometimes undesirable pressures. state taxes alone have gone from $4.9 billion in 1946 to $24.2 billion in 1964. an average increase of over a billion dollars a year. in 1965. property taxes increased 7.3 percent over the previous year. sales taxes went up 8.7 percent. corporate and individual income taxes rose 7.5 and 6.3 percent respectivelyall in 1 year. in 1964. state tax increases siphoned off onethird of the $6.5 billion federal tax cut. despite warnings from ecoists. a bewildering variety of consumption. payroll. and service taxes have appeared at the local level from detroit to oakland. fairbanks to mobile. los angeles to baltimore. over 40 cities have recently imposed motel and hotel taxes in an effort to shift some of their tax burdens to residents. in a frantic search for additional revenues. new hampshire has instituted a statesponsored sweepstakes on horseracing. the end is  in sight yet there is evidence that traditional taxes have already reached the limits of desirable expansion. dramatic proof of the growing disparity between government responsibilities and government resources is found in the increase in state and local debt. from a $15.9 billion level in 1946. public indebtedness at the state and local level almost doubled by 1952. since that year. state and local debt has tripled. an average increase of more than $41/2 billion per year. state governments. which can tap a wider variety of revenue sources than local authorities can. have been active in using these sources. between 1946 and 1963. less than 14 states instituted a tax on cigarettes. while general sales taxes were added as a source of funds by 13 states. at the same time. four states added an individual income tax. of course. virtually all states have also increased rates on previously tapped tax sources. the financing of local government expenditures has been a problem of at least similar difficulty. these governments rely almost exclusively upon property tax revenues. while the postwar increase in property valuations has swelled the property tax base. there has still been a steady need to raise the property tax rates themselves. interstate competition to attract new industryand similar competition among localitieshas undoubtedly hampered efforts to add to current revenues. particularly in the case of corporate taxes. states and localities generally offer some form of inducement to attract new corporations to their areas. with the longrange objective of creating new job opportunities and increasing the overall tax base. and this competition tends to restrain local governments from increasing tax rates. in the face of heavy demands placed upon state and local governments. the increase in their taxes and borrowing has been insufficient to prevent them from becoming gradually more dependent upon financial assistance from the federal government. the bulk of federal assistance in the form of grantsinaid programs has grown from a total of $884 million in 1946 to approximately $11 billion in 1965. in 1964 the federal expenditure of $9.8 billion represented approximately 16.7 percent of total taxes and other general revenues raised by state and local governments. compared with only 7.3 percent in 1946. grants to help support public welfare programs and to help build public roads and highways have shown the sharpest increase over the postwar years. and together they totaled some $7.5 billion in despite their achievements to date. state and local governments will continue to face a wide variety of additional public needs. and they do  want to curtail their responsibilities. they have doubled their employment over the past 13 years and increased their budgets many times. obviously. problems of water and air pollution. overcrowded schools. and substandard recreation and housing facilities. as well as inadequate health care exist. in our vast and diversified country. these services can often be most effectively provided only through programs run at the state and local level. thus. the immediate problem is to develop intergovernmental relationships that will enable state and local governments to carry out their vital role. ination and experimentation will be needed in future federalstate cooperation and in planning and budgeting public programs if we want to get maximum benefit out of every dollar spent. under the plan i introduce today. new york whose 196364 state and local revenues amount to $7.445 millionthe second largest in the nationwould receive $202 million. alaska. with state and local revenues during this period amounting to $89 millionthe smallest in the nationwould receive $2.6 million. similarly. california would receive $213 million and arkansas. $47 million. through this plan. for example. new york would receive a 31percent increase in federal aid. california. 17 percent. ohio. 20 percent. alabama. 39 percent. colorado. 16 percent. and kentucky. 37 percent. it may be argued by some that state and local governments will  use these federal funds wisely or that they will use them to reduce their own taxes and expenditures for necessary programs. experience of the past. however. indicates that such fears are groundless. a large proportion of total state and local outlays over the past years have been used for educational. health. and welfare purposesan indication that local governments are cognizant of the needs of their people in these areas and are attempting to meet them. grants made to state and local governments under a plan such as this will enable these bodies to operate more independently. local officials will be free of federal domination. and the spread of a growing federal bureaucracy may be halted. state and local governments will be in a stronger financial position. and a better fiscal balance will be achieved between federal. state. and local governments. . let me direct one word to those who may feel that the sort of taxsharing plan i propose would mean further incursion on state prerogatives. of course. there is always a possibility that this can happen. but. the choice we face is  between state dollars and federal dollars. but between federal dollars bound by strings and conditions and funds which are relatively unconditional and can help buttress the capability of state and local governments to carry their responsibilities and  to abdicate authority to the federal government due to financial inability to discharge it. for. we have to look to the days and years ahead when the demand for more and better local governmental services will increase. critics on the one side of the political spectrum are suspicious of the states and seemingly convinced of federal "infallibility". critics on the other side are suspicious of washington. but mutual suspicions should  produce a deadlock. for this country can be governed well unless government is imaginative and active and responsible and works at all levels in a federalstate system. i feel that the proposal embodied in the bill i introduced today can help prepare our governmental system to meet needs of the coming decades. and can help us to put cooperative federalism into practice for the benefit of all our people.
. israel is the country most often cited as an example of how our foreign aid program has worked to help change the face of a nation. ambassador john kenneth galbraith. in an article which appeared in poreign affairs in april 1961. said it well: one country that has shown great advance since the war. including great capacity to make effective use of aid. has been israel. it is singularly unendowed with natural resources. it has oil wells. few minerals. insufficient water. and  much space. but all of the four elements mentionedhigh literacy and a highly educated elite. the sense and the reality of social justice. an effective government. and a strong sense of purpose--are all present. so there is rapid progress. israel has indeed made good use of our aid. it has built a country that could serve as a model to its neighbors. if only those neighbors would transform their continuing hostility into peaceful cooperation. israel does serve as a model to many of the new nations of asia and africa. who look to her for guidance and technical khow because they k that many of their problems were once israels problems and that these problems can be surmounted by modern skills--and in what can only be called record time. we recognize israels pheenal accomplishments and we salute her. but this is  the time to turn away with compliments for a job well done. although israels ecoy has prosperedher currency reserves have increased to about $700 millionthere is aher side to the picture. israels foreign currency debt rose in 1964 from $919 million to $1.097 million. a debt burden that. per capita. is the highest in the world. and despite rising exports. her trade deficit is still about $450 million a year. israel is faced with a security problem that is unique and seriously threatens her ecoic viability. she is surrounded by hostile nations who are busily stockpiling armswhich they receive either as gifts or at discount prices. israel pays top prices for the arms she must have to protect herself. country gives her arms. country sells her arms at a discount. it is a hard fact of life that israel can ige the hate of which she is the target or the vulnerability of her position. she must arm herself to deter the aggression that otherwise might overwhelm her. and so the resources that could go into creating soil out of sand and settling people on reclaimed desert must perforce go for arms. it is astonishing to realize that in a country as small as israel. 60 percent of the land is uninhabitable. israel needs this area.  desert. it can afford to let it lie fallow. it needs the land to settle refugees who still look to israel for a havenfor farming. for industrial use. this will be possible only through irrigation. and in this connection. i want to stress that our cooperation with israel in a desalting project may well be the answer only in israel but in many places throughout the world. we are  extending to israel 20year development loans at 3.5 percent interest. if we continue making these loans. that country can continue to build. and if we continue selling her our surplus foods for israel pounds. she can continue to increase her imports from us. there has been a lot of talk in congress about the waste of counterpart funds. but israel has used these funds well. she has increased her imports from the united states and we have been a beneficiary. the near east report of october 4. 1965. contains an analysis of israels ecoic problems and what our aid has done to help her ecoy. this article. i believe. makes it clear that premature termination of our aid can be a serious setback to a country which still faces difficult ecoic hurdles. and i therefore ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the record.
s ecoic report and budget within the next few days. in view of the administrations unwillingness to appear before us on this issue in december. i plan to question the secretary of the treasury. the chairman of the council of ecoic advisers. and the director of the bureau of the budget. with regard both to their position on the federal reserve boards action of december 3. and on the subject of .ecoic policy coordination in general at that time. i believe that the committees republican membersand i am sure many members of the committees majoritywill be equally interested in hearing what the administration witnesses have to say on these vital issues. i hope that appropriate arrangements will be made among members of the "quadriad." that they will promulgate regulations for the purpose. and that thus this resolution will be unnecessary. but i hope it will point the way to a very necessary reform of what seems to be a large loophole in the coordination of ecoic policy within our federal government.
 has offered great plans but he is  giving the american people the program to meet those plans. yet it is well within our competence to do so. the way we are going to really win in vietnam is by winning over people in terms of education. health. and housing in order to give them a vested stake in what we are trying to accomplish in vietnam. even purely on the basis of national security grounds. it is worth our doing so as we juxtapose the amounts we are spending for war purposes in vietnam. i ask unanimous consent that a table indicating our ecoic assistance to vietnam in fiscal year 1967 and two previous fiscal years. as well as two editorials from the new york times and one editorial from the washington post on the new foreign aid program may be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
 johnson in his budget message requested legislation authorizing $150 million for the programs under the mass transit act for fiscal 1968this amounts to a 1year extension of the program at the same figure authorized for fiscal 1966 and 1967. i believe that neither the amount to be authorized  the 1year extension requested is actually egh. i am informed that demand for funds has exceeded the amount available in each year since the program was begun. the 1year extension does  give state and localities a long egh commitment of federal support to enable them to make comprehensive plans for .the future. accordingly. my proposal would amend the urban mass transportation act of 1964 to authorize appropriations through fiscal year 1970 and at the same time the amount authorized would be increased to $300 million through fiscal 1970. this amount would include the operating deficits program. a gradual increase to $50 million for fiscal 1969 is authorized for research. development. and demonstration projects. i am informed that at least three statesnew york. california. and pennsylvaniaare certain to make requests for funds amounting to more than the 12 /2percent limitation which any one state may receive under the present law. i intend to increase the limitation to 15 percent in the case of any state in which more than twothirds of the maximum grants have been made or obligated for projects and where the secretary determines that there is a substantial need for such an increase in order to carry out existing programs. this language is similar to that used in the urban renewal section of the housing act of 1949. as amendedsection 106(e). those who would see the transportation problemin particular the commuter situationas strictly a problem confronting the theastern section of the nation fail to see what i believe to be the significant national ramifications of this problem. for many. the commuter problem at this time is only a distant din. but as this nation continues to grow. i can tell you most assuredly that the problem will reach all sections of the nation. you may be sure this problem of urban transit will arise in atlanta or in san francisco or in other metropolitan areas in the future. this is the time for the legislators of all states to join with those of us who are presently immersed in this problem to enact legislation which will  only rid us of these recurrent urban transportation crises but will also prevent such problems from arising in the growing metropolitan areas. we must stay ahead of the growth of our urban transit needs by developing a farsighted comprehensive plan for urban mass transit through the setting up of regional mass transportation authorities. i believe the federal government. with one hand. must temporarily help the commuter railroads to stay alive. while with the other hand. it must give longterm aid so that these railroads may establish a more secure ecoic position through a capitalization program designed to modernize their facilities. i urge my colleagues to study the problem and to join with me in supporting this important legislation. i hope that this bill will be the subject of hearings along with a bill of the senator from new jersey which is  before the committee on banking and currency. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a resolution adopted by the common council of the city of syracuse. n.y.. favoring the enactment of legislation to establish a taxsharing formula to distribute to local governments a portion of federal tax revenues.
. my amendment proposes to include within the existing 7percent investment credit for new equipment and machinery. any money which is invested in a training program for workers which is approved by the secretary of labor. such training programs may encompass only the following categories: where the training is necessary for the national defense. or the training is necessary to replace skills of the individual which have become obsolete because of automation or techogical change. or to replace the skills of individuals dislocated because of changes in the national defense program. such as. for example. the shutdown of the brooklyn navy yard in my state. where thousands of people have been let out. in these cases. if the employer complies with the criteria established by the secretary of labor for a manpower training program. then the amounts which the employer expends in that respect would. along with. or in place of. his new equipment investments. be entitled to the 7percent credit. the estimated loss of revenue which would result. as closely as i can get it. would result only from the fact that there would be some modest increase in the use of the 7percent tax credit in cases where it is   fully being used. the tax  aggregates something in the area of $850 million to $1 billion. and at the very outside. the estimate of the amount involved here is $125 million.
ultimately it may. but in the meantime it is  allowable as a tax credit. that is the whole point of the amendment. the estimated revenue cost i have given is the outside estimate. because it was given to the senator from vermont in connection with the bill which he has introduced which seeks an additional 7percent tax credit for manpower training. . the employment and manpower subcommittee has been holding hearings this session and last on the real problem which faces us that. somehow or other. even with such programs as the manpower development and training act. we have  adequately tapped the resources of the private sector with respect to manpower training. that our need for manpower training is unusually great. and that we should. therefore. encourage it. i believe the incentive credit is the way to do this. especially as the 7percent equipment credit has  been fully used. it was expected at the time of its enactment in 1962 that its potential tax loss was approximately a billion and a half dollars. but the actual credits have run in the area of $850 million to a billion dollars. it is at least as important to have trained personnel in the country as it is to have modern and effective machinery. moreover. this amendment does  in any respect diminish our tax situation. because this is a 7percent credit which could be availed of only up to the maximum limits already in the law. all that the amendment does is expand the usefulness of the credit to include action in this critically important manpower training field.
let me make a counterproposition to the senator from louisiana. because we both k how these bodies work. this is a desirable tax proposal. we k this from the emous response which we have received from the business community. i believe that the senator is somewhat sympathetic to the belief that it would encourage very considerably additional manpower training. we could handle this in one of two ways. we can proceed. as the senator suggests. to a hearingand the senator would give me some assurance. i am sure. as to a reasonable hearing because sometimes these things become long deferredand cooperation in seeing that the necessary facts are produced. the fact is that this matter has been around for months and has  even got departmental reports. therefore. perhaps the better course would be for the senator to take it to conference. i will understand perfectly if. as a result of the conference. the senator would drop it. because we can get agreement with the house. at least. it will force the treasury department and labor department. and others. to lay the facts on the line quickly. if it is dropped in conference. then i am sure the senator will ho his indication to me that we will get a rather early hearing and be able to get to it. on the other hand. if it should be accepted in conference. and the departments really find there is merit to it. or may very well change it. we can work this out to their satisfaction. and to the senators satisfaction as well. at least it will be in being. and we will get action. in view of the fact that the amendment does  involve diminution of the existing tax or increase the existing tax. i make that alternative suggestion.
if the attorney general had intervened in such a case. the attorney general himself stated at page 43 of the record: despite separation in the department of justice. it (sec. 204(d)) would cause some difficulty. . on that point. the evidence comes directly from attorney general katzenbach. . i refer to page 36 of the record. which shows that i asked him as follows: senator javrrs. mr. attorney general. if you were a business executive and a man sent his card in and said. "i am from the community relations service of the department of justice. tell me everything you k in confidence" how would you feel about it. attorney general katzenbach. i would think they had employed an idiot in that service. i would think anybody that came in and said. "tell me everything you k in confidence" would  be a very sensible way to approach it. that is the whole ball game. the fact is. if one comes in from the department of justice. he comes in as the representative prosecuting agency in antitrust. civil rights. and tax matters. businessman. and certainly man who harbors prejudice himself. is going to talk as freely as he would to a conciliating agency. when he is assured that what he might say will be taken in confidence. whatever ambitious tautology the attorney general may try to spin out. to wit. that there can be disclosure from the internal revenue service. et cetera. the fact is that these are matters which will  be given in confidence. the attorney general would destroy with the left hand what he receives with his right hand. i think the transfer would destroyand i say this advisedlythe community relations serivces.
. on yesterday the senator from minnesota introduced s. 3181. a bill which would exclude from taxable income certain reimbursed moving expenses. as american business has grown across the country it has accepted the responsibility of moving an employee and his family when it becomes necessary to change job locations. yet. the federal government has failed to do its part in that it imposes an unfair tax liability on a great part of these reimbursed expenses. under the present law an employee may be reimbursed without payment of any income tax only for his actual travel costs and those of his immediate family as well as the costs of moving household goods from the old to new place of employment. the- line is drawn at this point in spite of the fact that the expenses i have just mentioned do  come close to meeting the total cost burden to a moving employee. s. 3181 would recognize what i believe to be a more realistic approach to what should constitute taxable moving expenses by adding to the expenses which already receive taxfree treatment the following reimbursements: first. the expenses of a househunting trip for the employee and his or her spouse. second. temporary living costs at his new location while he and his immediate family await the arrival of their household effects. third. the fees and other costs of selling his old house. fourth. expenses attendant on the purchase of a new house. such as attorney fees and other closing costs. and fifth. the numerous items commonly considered as a lump sum or miscellaneous figure. including appliance connections. licenses. size adjustments. and other incidentals. when it comes to reimbursement for moving. federal employees are at a disadvantage compared to most private industry employees. the federal employee is presently reimbursed only for the cost of moving himself and his family and the expense of moving his household goods whereas the employee of private industry is usually reimbursed for the five items mentioned above as well. last week the house passed legislationh.r. 10607which would allow the federal government to reimburse a moving employee for these five items as well. i shall actively support this measure when it comes before the senate. it seems inconsistent to me that we should recognizeas the house has already donethat these five expenses should  be a burden placed upon the employee but yet continue to treat reimbursement for them as taxable income. certainly this present tax policy imposes an impediment to ecoic mobility and progress. it is estimated that american industry transfers some 400.000 families from state to state each year. the benefit of reimbursement becomes seriously diminished to an employee who must treat it as ordinary income. the supreme court denied a review to a taxpayer who believed that he should be permitted a deduction for reimbursement. but it should be ed that the attorney general stated in his brief that it was for the congress and  thb court to make any such policy decision. i propose that the congress should make such a determination and therefore i urge my colleagues to join together in rectifying this present inequity in our federal tax structure. i had prepared and intended to introduce a bill along the same lines but did  do so yesterday because of the religious holidays. i am very pleased to join in cosponsoring the measure introduced by the senator from minnesota which is being held at the desk for additional cosponsors. and i ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor.
. an excellent analysis of the growing crisis of skilled manpower shortage was adopted by the republican coordinating committee on march 28. 1966. presented to the coordinating committee by the task force on job opportunities. the report stresses two aspects of needed governmental action which i and other republicans consider to be highly important. one is eliminating racial barriers to employment. i have introduced s. 3092. along with senators case and kuchel. a measure to strengthen both the substance and the enforceability of title vii of the 1964 civil rights act. banning racial discrimination in employment. the other is an incentive tax credit for investment in manpower training and retraining. i have introduced s. 2343. which would broaden the existing 7percent credit for investment in equipment and machinery to include investment in manpower. and senator prouty and congressman curtis have also introduced similar measures. the task force report provides an eloquent statement of the need for these steps to overcome the growing shortage of skilled manpower. i ask unanimous consent to have the task force report. entitled "the human investment." printed in the record.
s top ecoic advisers. the socalled quadriad. it will be recalled that as a result of the feds action last december. the question arose as to the appropriateness of the coordinating mechanism that existed between the various ecoic policymaking organisms of the executive branch. subsequent to evidence developed during hearings held by the joint ecoic committee. of which i am the ranking republican member. on this subject in december 1965. i introduced a resolution which would put congress on record in support of better coordination between the federal reserve board and the administration. the resolution outlined specific ways how this may be done. i am pleased to say that to a large degree the objectives of that resolution are  being fulfilled. i commend chairman martin and the council for improving the communication between each other. a communication link which is extremely vital to sound ecoic policymaking and i urge them to continue their effort to improve this vital mechanism. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of my resolution. senate concurrent resolution 73 and my statement accompanying its introduction as well as an article dealing with this subject which appeared in the april 24 washington post be included in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
the success which the senator from vermont has had with a number of his amendments on the floor has further made an impression on the bill on behalf of the miitys views. i think this is salutary. although i may  have agreed with some of the amendments. which is irrelevant to the point. the pending amendment relates to a provision in which we made a creative improvement. we took a pilot program for relocation of the really needy unemployed. who could  get a job where they were. and experimented a little bit. and did  wait for the end of the experiment. by which time quite a few of the "patients" might have been "dead." but built upon the experience and tried to project the program effectively for a reasonable future. i have pride of authorship about the amounts involved. i am prepared to coincide with the views of the senator on the reductions. which still leave. in my judgment. an effective extension of a program which can be helpful and which has made a real contribution by being included in this bill. the amendment also meets the views of the senator from delaware in deleting the open end authorization and limiting the program to the period of fiscal years 1967. 1968. and 1969. the amendment is acceptable to me. and i hope very much that the senator in charge of the bill will accept it. and the senate as a whole.
the miity leader. on this side of the aisle. has served his country and congress well by inviting attention to this situation. regardless of whether i or any other senator agrees with him as to specific cuts in the pay bill. or any other matter of that character. there is always a duty to balance the books. and we are  doing it. that is what the senator from illis is pointing out. that is his central theme. with which i thoroughly agree. let me suggest to the senator from illis that he has put his finger on two points. in addition to the question of appropriations. which are critically important to the country. there is the the shortness of money. the tightness of money. and the high interest rate which is unjustified by the nations credit standing. and there continues to be a serious imbalance in international payments which is restricting our maneuverability in banking terms throughout the world. the swiss bankers. are pretty much writing the ticket for the united states. as they maintain the books. it is therefore to them that the dollar is weak or the dollar is strong. let me ask my colleague. as a responsible leader in congress. this serious question: it may be that we can raise taxes in an election year for political reasons. but political reasons must. occasionally. give way to the interests of the nation. as the senator and i both k. it is unlikely that the pay bill will  be adopted. that the water pollution bill will  be passed. or that the antipoverty program will  be raised. does the miity leader feel that we must give serious consideration to our responsibility. and to the word "responsibility" of congress and consider a tax increase. the president is way behind his duty  and has himself brought us. in my judgment. to this present situation because he has been unwilling to face the necessity for a tax increase 4 or 5 months ago. which we could have done at the rate of 5 percent across the board. which would have materially helped us with our situation. i submit to the distinguished miity leader this serious question as to our responsibility. with which i thoroughly agree. can we afford to lay aside the alternative of a tax increase. which is an element of that responsibility. because it would be politically uncomfortable.
what the senator from delaware says is perfectly true. and what the miity leader says is perfectly true. we do  initiate tax legislation. perhaps that is fortunate. for tax legislation is very complex. and can have many pitfalls for a committee. i have little doubt that if we demanded it. the treasury would prepare a tax increase bill for us.. but ido think itwould be exculpating the administration much too far. with all due respect. . to join in what the senator .from delaware has said about the fact that the president has taken a great deal of credit for getting these new programs through. and further to point out the tremendous amount of machinery available to the federal government which is  being used. essentiallyand i speak  as a ranking member of the joint ecoic committeewe have been using monetary and  fiscal policy to deal with our inflationary dangers. what the senator from illis is saying is that it is high time to employ fiscal policy. fiscal policy includes  only debt management and taxation. but also includes credit regulation:andother measures available to the president. i think the president had better take a hard look at some of these things which are politically unpopular. i think the time has come when we have got to be unpopular and raise taxes. on that issue. i feel exactly as does the miity leader. i will vote for.it and take my chances. i think it must be done. i say it is time to use the power to regulate consumer credit and the various other authorities which the federal government has heretofore invoked in war situations. for that is what we are in. as the senator from vermont has said. those who feel we are following the right course in vietnam have got to be ready to face that music. too. the country today is at war. but it is  acting -that way in terms of its fiscal affairs. i think we should be grateful to the miity leader. with his emous prestige. for ringing that alarm bell today. and i think we ought to follow through and make it meaningful. the president will act. as we k. if there is an indication of concern in the country. such concern is very highly justified. the present tightness of credit could bring on a recession. or worse. senator aiken said you could get loans for 500 houses. you can. except fha money. private money is  obtainable. i talked to one of the biggest insurance companies in the united states this morning. they have money to lend in 1966 at all. and very little for 1967. that is. generally speaking. the state of the money market. -interest rates are  at 53/ percent for prime money. they could easily go through the 6 percent ceiling for this country. it is ridiculous. and could be ecoically suicidal.
a number of us are very much interested in both air and water pollution and the process of using some form of tax abatement to accelerate the mal process of research and development and the use of new facilities. i e with great interest that the committee in its report recommends a possible hydroprecipitator as a suitable subject to study. would the senator tell us something about the committees thinking on that subject.
. i ask unanimous consent to place in the record a copy of a recent article in the chicago news american of july 10 concerning the new federal rent supplement program and how it has affected the life of one new yorker. i commend this article to those who question the workability of this new program. it seems to me that in the example of the cambrelen family may be seen the beginnings of one of the most effective programs which the federal government has initiated in many years. i wish to e also that the city of new york has granted a 100percent tax exemption to the buildings in the project discussed in the article. this demonstrates the need for intergovernmental cooperation of this sort to really make the program valuable.
. i wish to support the senator from pennsylvania . i do  think he should be discouraged. because the times are catching up with the vital issues and problems involved. the senator from connecticut is to begin hearings with relation to what is to be done with respect to the cities and their problems. in my opinion. there are four or five issues which will determine the next election: vietnam. the high cost of living or inflation. riots in the streets. the civil rights struggle. and what to do about our cities. unless we have the brains and the experts to be assigned to cope with the managing of the problems and provide the means for doing so. we will be charged with bankruptcy and failure in the congress. we k that only trained people can cope with these problems in the cities. in new york city. even with the local pride we have. we had to reach out to philadelphia and new haven for experts. this is true of other cities. so we need  be chauvinistic about it. if we do  provide the funds we can have the personnel to administer the new program. we must keep pressing for it. there may be frustrating defeats. but sooner or later it will catch up even with the house of representatives.
 that persons within the federal area are afforded substantially the same rights. privileges. and taxsupported services as persons  within the area. this certification is revocable by the certifying agency if it is determined that the state is longer maintaining the requisite standards for certification. the agencys decisions regarding certification would be subject to the review provisions of the administrative procedures act. the bill would also guarantee the right of any person to initiate proceedings in a federal district court to prevent the collection of a state tax where the requirements for certification have been violated by that state. this proposal would serve to alleviate the injustice created by state taxation of persons whose rights are  protected by that state. it is also one means of encouraging all states to insure equal protection of the law to all persons.
that is exactly right. all these people have got is $50 million. our original intention was that they should have $300 million a year. when the participation sales act was passed  long ago. this particular agency came in for the sale of about $800 million of its paper. as a part of that $2 billion mass of paper which was to be sold. the only difficulty is that because of the very sharp difference between the interest rate on the paper which this agency has in hand3 percentand the going interest rate. which is almost 6 percent. the federal government is very reluctant to let any of this paper be sold. the sufferers are the colleges. because there is just money in the basket. all the money they have obtained has been the small amount of repayments received from past accumulations on loans. there is $200 million in such repayments at the disposition of the budget bureau. they have  even retained that. the bureau of the budget has allowed them $50 million of that amount. that is all there is. they have lowered the boom on all applications after january 31. 1966. as of that date. there are some $300 million of applications pending. i understand that. if they had continued to receive applications. they would today have approvable applications in the amount of $1.100 million. so big is the demand.
the senator is correct. i realize all of our financial problems. we have to balance the needs at a time like this. hence. i have  gone haywire as to the amount. i seek to have $300 million authorizedand that is pretty much a classic figurefor the next 3 years. rather than to go to any extremes and secure a much larger amount. under present conditions the institutions would be better off to have the interest rate raised across the board. they have got 3percent money. but they have money. in other words. they have a 3percent interest rate on this money. but money is available to them at 3 percent. hence. it is of use whatever if they can get the money in any way. we are really lowering the boom on college housing construction. except to institutions of great wealth that. can raise the money either by endowment or by borrowing it on investments. however. the small colleges are being hurt the most in this situation.
the first and most important element is practicality. because of the very high interest rate structure. it becomes much more expensive for the federal government to resell this paper at the 3percent rate. and it becomes counterproductive. . in other words. one reason why i believe that this paper is frozen and is  being put on sale is the gap which the federal government would have to meet in terms of money. this creates an immediate budget situation. i do  believe the colleges are being done a favor  by an academic 3percent rate being retained.
we should agree as to what the fiscal situation is in fiscal 1967. the senator said $300 million was available in fiscal 1967. i would like to question the senator on that point. my understanding is to the contrary. i wish to review the matter with the senator.
 i am sure the senator is . the senator from maine is one of the most reliable members of this body and the last man who would want to confuse anybody. however. i wish to suggest that the facts are  too clear. i understood that they had $300 million for the fiscal year 1966. that was the first year of the program. they borrowed that money from the treasury at the 3percent rate and loaned it out.  there comes 1967 when. because we had passed the participation sales act of 1966. the authorization was canceled out with the full expectation that the paper would be sold and the money would go into the program. . things happen and that is  so. does the senator want to let them go back to the basis that they did before. to the treasury. where they are sure of getting the money. but for a higher rate of interest.
i do  think that is so at all. i think the director of the budget has told the senator the truth. the director of the budget is under a duty to serve the united states on the sales of the participation certificates to the best of his ability. the director of the bureau of the budget expects to sell the certificates. and i would be the first to condemn him if he sold them improvidently. whatever he said. the fact is that he can guarantee it. matter what the senator says or matter what i say. what he might do. if he chosebut he does  choose to do sowould be to release some of the $205 million which results from repayments on the college loans. he has only chosen to release $50 million. he will determine to sell the participation certificates when. as. and if he thinks it is in the best interest of the country to sell them. however. there is hing inconsistent between that proposition and the amendment. because the amendment is intended to make the money available when the law takes place. the institutions could go to the banks and get the money at a higher interest rate. and i make this statement advisedly. but in my judgment it would be worth more to the institutions if they could get the money at a slightly higher rate than to have the 3 percent provision on the books when they can get the money. many of these private institutionsand most of them are private--can borrow the money. the only people who can borrow the money are the states. and some of the states are in pretty bad financial trouble. california has just borrowed money. incidentally. at a higher interest rate than is provided for in my amendment. they borrowed money at the rate of 4.85 percent. however. other states are holding back. my amendment is designed to find a way to actually get money flowing without in any way crossing up the budget bureau on the sale of participation certificates. i seek to get things going until such time as the other activities can take up the slack. that is why i said to the committee that. when they get into conference. they may write such provision as will carry out the intention of the senate.
on the investment tax credit point. i am very worried about that for this reason: in fairness. that credit could  be taken off immediately. it would have to be phased out. because many people or corporations undertake capital investment on the expectation of an investment tax credit. so there would be lost the immediate impact of taking it off. what worries me is  that so much in itself as the fact that we would need measures of great immediacy. if they were  put into effect. they would  bring about the objectives that i have expressed as being desirable.
. the letter in part reads as follows: wethat is. the majoritybelieve that the leadership and the appropriate committees of both houses should take action to bring before the congress proposed legislation to effectuate the recommendations made last march by this committee in order that the objectives of the employment act may be more fully achieved * * * under the circumstances. our energies should be directed to the work of the legislative committees. for hearings by the joint ecoic committee would be more likely to delay rather than to expedite action at this late stage in the legislative session. we of the miity thoroughly disagree. we think the action of the majority members of the joint ecoic committee in refusing to hold immediate hearings on the present state of the ecoy is one more example of how the administration and its majority forces in congress are playing hide and seek with the inflation issue. we wanted partisan hearings for the purpose of guiding the administration and the congress and restoring the confidence of all segments of the american people in the administrations fiscal and monetary policies. it is all too plain that there is a certain amount of needling with respect to a tax increase to finance the vietnam war. a temporary. acrosstheboard tax increase. of somewhere between $5 and $10 billion is necessary. it is absolutely essential to the ecoic health of this country and to finance the rising costs of the vietnam war. we of the miity recommended in march 1966 that the current ecoic situation requires fiscal as well as monetary restraint. there is substitute for it. there is a money panic as well as an interestrate panic. it is appalling that the administration is  willing to face the music at the present time. but is willing to wait until even more drastic action is necessary. since the administration was only too willing to take full credit and responsibility for the beneficial effects of the tax cut in 1964. it must  understand that it must accept blame and responsibility for any damage done to our ecoy by its policy of indecision and delay until after the elections. this policy is all too plainly illustrated in the uficial leaks. the uficial comments of high treasury officials and the trial balloons floated on the front pages of our newspapers almost dailyevery day some new suggestion is made. some new scheme. apparently in the hope that public relations devices can somehow keep our ecoy afloat until the last poll closes on ember 8. in the reply to the republican request for hearings received this morning. the majority says that this is  the time for study. but for action. i agree. but action on what. the administration has given congress hing to act on that would in any way effectively deal with the inflation that exists today. the majority said that this action should take place in other committees. committees with legislative responsibility. this begs the question. because these committees do  have before them any administrationsponsored legislation that can effectively deal with the current situation. the majority said that this is the time for the congress to act on recommendations made by the joint ecoic committee in march. but the remedies proposed by the committee in march are longer sufficient to meet the current grave situation. i am deeply regretful that the joint ecoic committee refused the request of the miity. the intention was to hold those hearings in a partisan way. i believe the country would be better served by holding those hearings. with or without the hearings. inflation is the greatest domestic issue. the country is scared. that issue ranks with the vietnam war as the  1 issue. it is going to be the issue in this election. with all due respect. i think it would be better for the administration to face up to the issue rather than to avoid it. it is the view of the miity that it would improve the situation to have hearings. whether the johnson administration or the committees democrats want to admit it or . we are in the midst of a serious inflation which the administration must deal with . every day of delay only aggravates the situation and ultimately will require stronger fiscal remedies. under secretary of the treasury joseph barrs testimony before a house committee suggests that. after months of indecision and delay. the administration may be willing to admit what has been evident for months to manythat it can avoid a tax increase and continue to rely on monetary policy to contain inflation. the administration has tried and failed to walk a fine line between avoiding inflation and promoting high employment. with the result that it may achieve neither. a new policy approach is clearly required. there is every evidence that an inflationary psychology is rapidly spreading through the ecoy. and. indeed. that our inflation is becoming as bad as that in europe in its days of inflation.
i have read the prepared speech of the senator from delaware. unhappily. i was  in the chamber to listen to it all. i think it was an excellent speech. quite in character with the senator from delaware. whom we all respect so much. while i may  agree with all seven points. the fact is that here is. again. a willingness to face reality. it is said that the president is  doing many of these things. as the senator ks. i. too. am for an acrosstheboard tax increase. the senator fixes his at 5 percent. i have suggested the possibility of 7 percent. the important thing is that we would be getting at it. what i wish to ask the senator is: is he inclined to agree with me that those who may be counseling the president that it would be bad politics to advocate a tax increase . perhaps are counseling him unwisely. because in an emergency of this kind. with concern over inflation. it seems to me that the people want some realism. some effective action taken. and the kind of decisiveness which they expect their president to have. therefore. it might be the path of political wisdom. as it were. to "come clean" with the people and tell them what needs to be done. in order to have a measurable effect on the inflationary sweep. and make it a reality with a tax increasewhich is so long overdue. let me also say to the senator from delaware that i like very muchbefore he commentshis retirement bond idea. that could be an attractive proposition for many people. the e bonds. of course. are popular. .the retirement bond idea might turn out to be popular. also. and induce the public to invest at a fair interest rate. considering present conditions.
. it seems to me. from the ecoic point of view. that a far more logical argument could be made that a rise in scale for farmworkers will bring in more farmworkers rather than fewer. the real argument made is that farmers will  pay the increase. even at the risk of letting the crops rot in the ground. considering the price of food today. i most respectfully submit that this is certainly a doubtful thesis. as i see it. that is the net effect of this argument. we have a reasonable increase in the minimum wage. already outstripped by the cost of living in proportion to the productivity of the country. in agriculture there are represented a modest segment of those affected by the increase in the minimum wage. we have gone through all kinds of pay raises. and we have given exemptions to handicapped workers. fulltime students. local workers. and children. they defeated in conferenceand it broke my heartany hope of doing anything more about child labor. we have child labor provision in this bill. except the provision prohibiting "patticularly hazardous" agricultural employment. so children can work. it seems to me under all the circumstances that to ask for a modest minimum of 30 cents an hour less than they get for industrial and service workers represents a pretty fair settlement that we got from the house. i wish to close as i began. senators should remember when they vote that this may be the only vote and that the question will be the interests of 36 million to 37 million american workers. i believe that the agricultural segment has been fairly and liberally treated in the bill when all of the features have been taken into consideration.
i am entirely in favor of this measure. i am drawing on my recollection . but i believe that it is a fact that contributions made by individuals to unicef. such as those received on the famous "trick or treat" tour that the children take at halloween. whereby a good deal of money is collected for unicef. and which is a marvelous demonstration of the childrens feeling for it. are  tax deductible. is the senator to tell us whether that has been checked into at all.
i believe that they are  tax deductible. and i should like to use this occasion. when we are establishing a point of ho to unicef. to make aher point which. perhaps. will do that organization as much good as ho. though ho is great. they can certainly use more money. many such voluntary contributions in this country are tax deductible. and i believe that more contributions for this extremely deserving cause. the united nations childrens fund. could be obtained if we would give it some degree of tax exemption. i do  see any reason why it should  be a complete tax exemption. i hope very much that some consideration may be given by the administrationwho would have to request itto this matter. we have been after them for a long time. and i shall keep after them. but i suggest and urge. at this point. that that be done. as well as doing unicef ho. let us also do it some good. i thank the senator.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a memorandum entitled "the investment tax credit: an inappropriate fiscal tool for shortrun stabilization." prepared by the miity staff of the joint ecoic committee. also an article published in the september 1966 fortune magazine. and some editorials on this subject.
. i ask unanimous consent. with the consent of the respective sponsors of the bills. that i may be made a cosponsor of s. 3769. the federal water pollution control act. and s. 3000. a bill to permit states or other duly constituted taxing authorities to subject persons to liability for payment of property taxes on property located in federal areas within such state. at the next printing of the bills.
. i have -worked out in committee with the senator from arkansas the necessary compromise. and it is a rather considerable compromise on the amount to be provided with respect to treatment facilities in title vi of this bill. the figure was doubled from $7.5 million to $15 million and it is  entirely satisfactory to me. in cooperation with the department of health. education. and welfare. and other authorities. we have prepared a substitute for title vi of the bill. which. in our judgment. is desirablei do  use the word "essential". but it is desirableleaving the money figures the same. but tightening up the language giving more fiscal controls for the federal government. balancing out the role for the states. and so forth. that language is satisfactory to the agency which will administer the act. and the language would. in our judgment. make a very much more finished product. but as i thoroughly agree with the senator from arkansas . with whom i have had the most cordial relations on this matter. it would be difficult to ask him on the floor. and at this writing. to take what is a very comprehensive rewrite of title vi in terms of authority. though  of money or intent. i have  agreed with senator mcclellan to offer this simple amendment which is  pending in order to spell out the clear intent of the bill. in addition. if it is considered desirable in conference. i would hope that he would add such parts of the proposed substitute for title vi on the administrative aspects of the matter. as would be useful. the senator from arkansas is gracious egh to say that i will be a conferee on this matter. too. in order to work it -out intelligently. thus. for the purpose of debate on my amendment. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the original amendment which i prepared may be printed in the record. but. of course. i stand by the amendment i have offered and hope very much that the senator from arkansas will see fit to accept it.
senator cooper. who is necessarily absent from the senate today. has asked me to bring about the correction of what is obviously a typographical error in the committee report. which otherwise might cause unnecessary concern in his state. the item appears in table ii at page three of the committee report. in the list by states of estimated grants under title i of the bill. and in table v at page 18. "estimated grants under title i." comparing the administration proposal and the senate bill. obviously. the figure for kentucky under the column "fiscal year 1967" in each case is completely inconsistent with the other figures in the tabulation. obviously. it is an incorrect figure. could the chairman of the committee give us the correct figure for estimated fiscal 1967 grants under title i for the state of kentucky. in lieu of $13.042.933.
and mr. dominck to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate insists upon its amendments to the bill entitled "an act making appropriations for military construction for the department of defense for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1967. and for other purposes." requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. stennis. mr. proxmire. mr. yarborough. mr. symington (ex officio). and mr. saltonstall to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also annced that the senate agrees to the amendments of the house to a bill of the senate of the following title: s. 3460. an act to authorize the secretary of the interior to enter into contracts for scientific and techogical research. and for other purposes. the message also annced that the senate had passed bills of the following titles. in which the concurrence of the house is requested: s. 84. an act to provide for reimbursement to the state of wyoming for improvements made on certain lands in sweetwater county. wyo.. if and when such lands revert to the united states. and s. 2358. an act to authorize the secretary of the interior to sell reserved phosphate interests of the united states in certain lands located in the state of florida to the record owners of such lands.
. i have asked for 5 minutes which the senator from delaware. with his customary courtesy what he has stated with respect to his intentions is how i feel with respect to the bill. i. too. shall vote for the bill. but i think i reflect the sentiments of many of our members when i say that. in voting for it. i vote for at least something in an effort to take care of a bad situation and. in my judgment. a decision which must have been decided upon at this time because of the time situation. namely. prior to an election. there is question that the legislation will  materially improve the situation with respect to inflation. the authorities agree. even apart from the exceptions. that the legislation will  take effect for from 9 months to a year. by that time we may wish we had never done this. because we may be in a recession. rather than in an ecoy which needs dampening. what should have been done early this year was to have an acrosstheboard temporary tax increase to finance the war in vietnam. this is a "soak business" proposition. it may be more palatable politically. but it is  going to do the job. it is  going to take out of the buying stream more than $11/2 to $2 billion. a 11/2 to 2 percentage point increase in taxes on individuals and 21/2 to 3 percentage point tax increase on corporations would have taken out of the buying stream $5 1/2 billion to $71/ billion. and would have made a measurable difference. this measure is  going to aid in the fight against inflation. those who feel as i do in this respect have alternative but to support this measure for what it is worth. but we must emphasize that it is  worth very much. in addition. we need to review our agricultural price policy. this is a foodandservices inflation period which we are experiencing. at the same time. we are boosting the agricultural price level by government policies hung over from aher day. finally. let me say that we are suffering idinately from high interest rates and tight money. the administration did  institute a voluntary credit restraint program. which we did in the korean war. the suspension of tne investment tax credit. which was given priority by the administration will be but the mildest kind of palliative. we must devise a temporary increase in taxes across the board. our people are willing to sacrifice for vietnam. we must have voluntary credit restraints. organized as they were during the kooctober 14. 1966 coin rean war. we should have an agricultural price policy which will meet the inflationary thrust of the cost of food to the housewife. if we took all those measures. we would be striking a blow for a sound ecoy. and against inflation. what we are doing is restrictive and a mere palliative. it is the best we can do under the circumstances. in view of the policy of the administration. but we will rue the day we did so little and so late. i ask unanimous consent that a statement i made on inflation in the senate on august 16. a memorandum prepared by the miity staff of the joint ecoic committee. and a column written by henry c. wallich in the october 3 issue of newsweek may be made part of my remarks.
. we fail to commemorate the extraordinary heroism of such men who. routinely. risk life and limb to protect the public. a disaster of this scale. however. calls to mind our emous debt to these brave men. as their senator. and as an individual. i express my deepest sympathy to the families of these firemen12 widows. one of whom is also the daughter of a fireman killed in the line of duty. and 32 children. i ask unanimous consent that a new york times article concerning the tragedy. be printed at this point in the record.
 for signature into law. it has had the support of both the national association for retarded children and the council for exceptional children. the principal organizations in this field. the bill authorizes an appropriation of $7 million for fiscal year 1968. $12 million for fiscal year 1969. and $15 million for each of fiscal years 1970 and 1971. these federal funds must be used to supplement the level of state and local expenditures for mental retardation facility operations. this measure is. in effect. an investment in rehabilitation. mentally retarded children can be educated to be useful citizens. in many cases selfsupporting. and in most instances to be free of the need for expensive institutional care. if adequately rehabilitated. between 75 percent to 85 percent of the mentally retarded can become selfsupporting. and between 10 percent and 20 percent can become partially selfsupporting. the remainder will remain completely dependent. more important--and incapable of measurementis the effect this rehabilitation will have on parents and family to whom the necessity for institutionalization is a shattering experience. and the meaning to the retarded themselves also can be measured in moneyit is the difference between being a whole human person and being an impersonal statistic in an institution. three out of every 100 children born are destined to be mentally retarded. mental retardation is the major cause of disability among the young adults. aged 21 to 35. who receive assistance under the federal program for aid to the permanent and totally disabled. while communities are spending more than $650 million annually for treatment. education. and training of the mentally retarded. these services fall short of the need for special training and care that is required. they require the staffing assistance provided by this bill. the mental retardation facilities and community centers construction act of 1963 would be further amended by the measure i introduce today to include the cost of acquiring sites as part of construction costs for mental health centers and mental retardation facilities. experience has shown that the original act was  broad egh to cover critical situations. especially in urban areas where land is expensive and often difficult to obtain. in urban areas. this shortcoming represents a serious deterrent to the public and private agencies desiring to provide buildings for services. the provision to correct this situation follows the pattern of the amendment to the vocational rehabilitation act adopted by the 89th congress. while recognizing that the matching formula in the present law is inadequate. i have refrained from including corrective language in my bill at this time. however. when this 90th congress considers renewal of the present statute. it is my intention to press in committee for reform of this and other inequitable allocation formulas. under present law. the federal share of construction projects varies from 331/3 to 66% percent among the states. thus. an organization or community with modest resources would receive the minimum federal share if located in a highincome state and. conversely. a welltodo community or organization would receive the maximum federal contribution if located in a lowincome state. this obviously is unfair and demands correction. i urge all who are concerned with the wellbeing and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded to join in this effort to bring to these unfortunates the care and training they require and which. all too often. overburdened state. local. andl private agencies are unable to provide.
 missed a great opportunity in his state of the union message in failing to propose legislation providing for the sharing of federal revenues with the states. he did. of course. make the declaration: * * * only a total working partnership among federal. state. and local governments can succeed. but declarations are  egh. he failed to e that the relationship between washington and other levels of government in this country today. in terms of real taxing power. more closely resembles that of a patriarch to poor relatives than a partnership of equals. the interchange of ideas and services so essential to a genuine partnership will  be possible until the states and local governments have the financial resources to inate. to initiate and to pay for programs designed to meet the individual needs of their people. this can be done without money. and many states are already using their taxing powers to the fullest extent possible. in my judgment there can be genuine partnership between the federal and local governments without some well designed program of federalstate revenue sharing with a minimum of strings attached. the bill being introduced today is designed to accomplish this in the most meaningful and equitable way. so that the poorer states will have an opportunity to improve their services and that the socalled richer states will have the resources necessary to meet the overwhelming problems of their urban complexes. there has been growing support. both inside and outside of congress. for legislation to distribute a portion of federal tax revenues to the states with a minimum of federal controls since i first introduced a distribution formula based on the hellerpechman proposals in 1965. in that year. the ripon society. a group of republican activists at harvard. and the republican govers association were among the few groups to support such an idea. but in recent months. representatives and senators of both parties have either introduced revenuesharing legislation or have declared their intention of doing so in the near future. as an example. two of the cosponsors of this measuresenators baker and scott also plan to introduce programs of their own incorporating certain additional inations. in 1966. both the bipartisan national govers conference and the national league of cities called for the sharing of federal revenues with states and local governments. nevertheless. in view of the administrations failure to act in this field. i am pleased to see the initiative taken by members of my party. including representatives goodell and reid of new york. republican support for this idea should be based on the record of those state and local governments which can show accomplishment and should be motivated by our desire to enable other levels of government to meet the growing needs of their residents by themselves. many republicans in congress believe that an effective revenuesharing program would be a major step in this direction and i hope we can successfully convince the majority and the administration. the problem facing state and local governments is essentially this: while their expenditures have risen steeply in the postwar period. their present and foreseeable resources are  adequate to meet the expanding demands for greater services. the increased costs of education or the complex problems of development. unless legislation is enacted giving states and local governments a share of federal tax revenues with a minimum of strings and with maximum freedom to spend it as they see fit. the trend will continue inexorably toward more grantinaid programs. with increasing federal intrusion into decisionmaking at the state and local levels. the strain on state and local government finances is illustrated by the 125 percent increase in total debt outstanding for state and local governments over the past decade while the federal debt increased by 14 percent. the outlook for the future is  very encouraging either. a study recently published by the joint ecoic committee estimates state and local government debt. totaling about $100 billion in 1965. will reach $145 billion in 1970 and almost $200 billion in 1975. the states undoubtedly will increase their sources of revenue from property taxes. sales taxes and individual income taxes. the question is can they increase these taxes without limit. state and local tax revenues increased from $23.5 billion in 1955 to $51.6 billion in 1965. interstate competition to attract new industryand similar competition among localitieswill undoubtedly hamper efforts to add to current revenues. particularly in the case of corporate taxes. states and localities generally offer some form of inducement to attract new corporations to their areas. with the longrange objective of creating new job opportunities and increasing the overall tax base. this sort of competition tends to restrain local governments from increasing tax rates. in the face of heavy demands placed upon state and local governments. the increase in their taxes and borrowing has been insufficient to prevent them from becoming gradually more dependent on financial assistance from the federal government. between 1955 and 1965 federal aid to the states increased by 252 percent. the bulk of federal assistance in the form of grantsinaid has grown from a total of $884 million in 1946 to approximately $11 billion in 1965. in 1964 the federal expenditure of $9.8 billion represented approximately 16.7 percent of total taxes and other general revenues raised by state and local governments. compared with only 7.3 percent in 1946. grants to help support public welfare programs and to help build public roads and highways have shown the sharpest increase over the postwar years. and together they totaled some $7.5 billion in 1964. it may be argued by some that state and local governments will  wisely use federal funds under a revenuesharing plan or that they will use them to reduce their own taxes and expenditures for necessary programs. experience of the past. however. indicates that such fears are groundless. a large proportion of total state and local outlays over the past years have been used for educational. health. and welfare purposesan indication that local governments are cognizant of the needs of their people in these areas and are attempting to meet them. grants made to state and local governments under a plan such as this will enable -these bodies to operate more independently. local officials will be free of federal domination. and the spread of a growing federal bureaucracy may be halted. state and local governments will be in a stronger financial position. and a better fiscal balance will be achieved between federal. state. and local governments. . let me direct one word to those who may feel that the sort of taxsharing plan i propose would mean further incursion on state prerogatives. of course. there is always a possibility that this can happen. but the choice we face is  between state dollars and federal dollars. but between federal dollars bound by strings and conditions and funds which are relatively unconditional and can help buttress the capability of state and local governments to carry their responsibilities and  to abdicate authority to the federal government due to financial inability to discharge it. for. we have to look to the days and years ahead when the demand for more and better local governmental services will increase. critics on the one side of the political spectrum are suspicious of the states and seemingly convinced of federal infallibility. critics on the other side are suspicious of washington. but mutual suspicions should  produce a deadlock. for this country can be governed well unless government is imaginative and active and responsible and works at all levels in a federalstate system. i feel that the proposal embodied in the bill introduced today can help prepare our governmental system to meet needs of the coming decades. and can help us to put cooperative federalism into practice for the bjenefit of all our people. the issue of revenue sharing involves a struggle between those who want the federal government to earmark everything and those who want to leave something to the states. provided there is something in addition. in other words. the federal funds provided are added to the states resources and are spent largely at the discretion of state and local governments on the basis of their priorities. i am with those who believe that with the safeguards written into this billand i am the ranking member of the committee on labor and public welfare which handles most of these programswe are better advised to begin the process of some form of federal revenue sharing with the states and localities. letting them. as they progress in showing their ability to discharge their responsibilities. get a greater and greater share of federal tax revenues rather than being tied to the grantinaid idea which. up to . has been the best we could do. i do  believe that the grantinaid program has given us the optimum efficiency or the optimum return per dollar expended.
. i join this year with my colleague from vermont and with dozens of other members of the miity in both the senate and the house in sponsorship of this measurethe human investment act. last year. though i certainly supported the intent of this bill. i introduced together with the senator from indiana my own bill. s. 2343. to grant a tax credit for employer expenses incurred in connection with certain types of training. i chose to introduce a separate bill because i felt that it was important to link the taxcreditfortraining proposal closely with the then existing credit for investment in new machinery and equipment since the logic underlying the two credits is basically identical. because the investment credit is  suspended. because i think that a tax credit for training should be enacted without regard to whether a similar credit exists for costs of new equipment. and because i think that it is vitally important that those of us who support this approach do so with a maximum of unity and force. i am joining with the senator from vermont this year on the refined and improved human investment act. there is some indication that this year the tax credit proposal may receive a more sympathetic hearing from the administration. secretary wirtz. in a speech at catholic university on ember 16. 1966. encouraged the "fuller exploration and development of ideas we have so far only toyed with." stating that among these ideas he included "the repeated proposalsrepeatedly. so far. found wanting in some respectfor using tax credits to encourage enlarged employer training programs--as well as increased capital expenditures for equipment." i would encourage the senator from vermont. and i am sure he will agree. to take the secretary up on the suggested "fuller exploration" and to request from him specific suggestions as to what kind of a tax credit approach he would find acceptable. i strongly believe that we have great unfulfilled responsibilitles in the job training field and that we have commensurate unused resources for such training in the private sector. surely. we have at last progressed beyond the belief that somehow the tax system should  be used to help match those responsibilities and resources. we must use the weapons available to us. and there is reason why the tax system should  be used to accomplish necessary social purposes.
. the department of health. education. and welfare has  as yet. i am advised. formulated its policies with respect to reallotment for the next fiscal year. fiscal year 1968. which begins july 1. 1967. i hope that the department. in reaching. its decision. will operate openly. consulting with and informing both the appropriate congressional committees and the states. *rather than just make its own unilateral decisions. and deprive the states which need it. like my own state of new york. of the reallocation which has been traditional with the operation of the department. the situation demands less than that.
. hearings over the past year in both the executive reorganization and intergovernmental relations subcommittee of the government operations committee have made all of us more aware of the existing problems of our federal system. i have for many years recommended a greater use of regional and metropolitanwide planning and am pleased to be a cosponsor of senator scotts proposal. the comprehensive planning and coordination act of 1967s. 799. the proposal would make federal matching funds available for the establishment of regional planning agencies with grants of up to twothirds of the cost of planning activities of such agencies. in addition after fiscal 1968. any application for federal assistance by an agency of state government would be accompanied by the comments of the comprehensive planning agency of the state government. i ask unanimous consent that the recent remarks of richard murphy. legislative assistant to senator scor. before the national legislative conference of county officials. on february 27. 1967. be placed in the record at this point. i believe that mr. murphy has presented an excellent statement of the problems together with the projected solutions of senator scotts proposal.
s failure to propose legislation in this area has provided republicans with a major issue. i am very pleased to say that we have seized the issue. and also that we have put forth specific and detailed proposals to implement it. unless legislation is enacted giving states and local governments a share of the federal tax revenues with maximum freedom to spend it consistent with protective conditions precedent against abuse. the trend will continue inexorably toward more conditional grantinaid programs. with increasing federal intrusion into decisionmaking at the state and local levels. in my judgment. there can be genuine partnership between the federal and local governments without some welldesigned program of federalstate revenue sharing. the bill being introduced today. and those that have been introduced before this year. are designed to accomplish this in the most meaningful and equitable way. so that the poorer states will have an opportunity to improve their services and so that the socalled richer states will have the resources necessary to meet the overwhelming problems of their urban complexes. the choice facing the states and local governments today is  between more state dollars and federal dollars. but between federal dollars bound by strings and conditions. and funds which are relatively flexible in use and can help buttress the capability of state and local governments to carry their responsibilities and  to abdicate authority to the federal government due to the financial inability to discharge them.
the situation is such that i think a motion to table is the only thing that is appropriate to the occasion. but i do  want to cut off debate. if the senator wishes to debate it further. -i will stay my hand further. it seems to me that. with this approach. we are getting into thick ground and we do  k what may come out of it. this is a tariff measure. we have had many tax amendments considered. i suppose that could be justified on the ground that this is a tax measure.  we are into tariffs. i do  k what more critical area we could get into. i am  the policeman of the senate. but since it is a measure which affects consumers and foreign trade. it has given me cause to raise these questions. because i have a great interest in those two matters. i think an effective way to deal with it would be to move to table and let the senate decide the question. and see if it wants to stop the charade which the senator from rhode island has called this action. or whether it proposes to take this kind of action.
. i had an amendment at the desk which related to the problems of the handicapped. there was a very splendid analysis of that situation by dr. rusk in the new york times about a week ago pointing out the way in which the united states was considering emous amounts of money but was  giving some tax consideration to the handicapped. as it did to the blind. my only purpose in seeking to propose the amendment would be to ask the senator if he would give me a hearing. evenif it were a brief hearing. and the leader will table anyhow. in view of the backing which this proposal has. i hope that the senator will give us a reasonable opportunity in the future to consider the matter.
. i am hoed to be a cosponsor of the amendment. however. i think politically that a showing of an intelligent application to our jobs far outweighs the feelings of some people concerning the size of the salary or the number of assistants. we serve as 100 senators with the fate of the world in our hands. and we render our best judgment. that is why the people sent us here. they expect us to use our best judgment and to stand up and defend ourselves against those who oppose what our best judgment dictates. that is the type of amendment offered by the senator. and i am very hoed to support it.
. i shall  go over the arguments that have already been made. i think i have made my pres"entation as clearly as i am capable of making it. we have had senators present who have heard the arguments. however. in conclusion. i wish to say one thing. it seems to me a little amusing that senators think it is absurd that senators can vote yea or nay. up or down. on the detailed merits of a 100page or 150page revenue billand they have done it time and time againand that they do  think they have the capacity to vote yea or nay on the overall fairness. if they have to. and to render a veto on some factual decisions made by a special board about railroad workers. i hazard the guess that there are as few tax experts in the chamber as there are labor experts.
. for the past 3 days. the subcommittee on fiscal policy of the joint ecoic committee has been holding hearings on revenue sharing and its alternatives. we had before us some of the outstanding experts in the field of state and local fiscal problems. and the record being established in our hearings and the staff studies released concurrently are a major contribution to focusing public and congressional attention on the fiscal problems of the states and local governments. and on the limitations involved in our existing federal categorical grantsinaid programs. basically. these hearings raise the question whether the trend toward greater centralization of the disposition of public expenditures at the federal level is a good or a bad thing for our federal system. and if so. how this trend can be arrested while continuing to meet our vital domestic social needs. perhaps centralization is an "irreversible trend of history." as one writer put it today. but let us explore this question and the possibilities of the federal system with the greatest care. i ask unanimous consent that the excellent testimony given before our subcommittee this morning by dr. walter heller. former chairman of the council of ecoic advisers. and by joseph pechman. director of ecoic studies of the brookings institution. on this vital subject. be printed in the record.
. i point out that this country is  standing still. the population increases something like 2 or 3 percent a year. the gross national product increases in excess of thatsomething like 7 or 8 percent a year. i have just had brought to me the gross national product figures. for 1966. on an annual basis. the gross national product increased 8 percent. for 1967. it increased between 6 and 7 percent. the tax take increases. and the needs of the country increase. we are grown men. and we have to recognize it. so the idea of coming in here and suddenly saying. "i do  k where to cut. so slash it across the board." i do  think it is fair to us or to the country. as i said a moment ago. while i have the greatest respect for the views of the senator from delaware. i believe in this instance we would be unwise to act in this fashionafter a committee heavily weighted with people who have a very sharp eye to ecoy has reported the bill unanimouslyby agreeing to the amendment of the senator from delaware. i join with the senator from alabama in expressing the hope that the amendment will be rejected.
congress. last year. the alliance was authorized for $697 million and at $750 million for fiscal years 1968 and 1969. they had a right. when they read it. to rely on it. we can cut the appropriation threequarters and it would mean hing at all. in terms of latin america. as would cutting the authorization. that is all i am really arguing. that is the temper of latin america. and those of us who worked there very ardentlyat least i feel that wayunderstand that. and that is why i think the authorization request is critically important.
. with those assurances. which i think are important. i shall  stand in the way of passage of this bill. i agree with the senator that new financial techniques always require new methods of financial control. and i will be the first.to say that the. senator from new jersey and the senator from california may very well have come abreast of a very real problem in this regard. of course. we still have the problem of mergers and -consolidations. and we have the problem of exchanges of stock. whether as a result of merger and consolidation or otherwise. but i gather that the point of the senator from new jer- the funds made available under section 2 of sey and the senator from california is this act shall be limited to 25 per centum that this is at least a beginning in keep- of the available funds to any single project. to 90 per centum of loan guarantee. and. ing up with getting adequate represen- with respect to all loans. the degree of partation and adequate information on the ticipation prudent under the circumstances part of the stockholder. who could con- of individual loans but directly related to ceivably be imposed upon. without deny- minimum essential participation necessary ing him the opportunities which result to accomplish the purposes of this act. from the competive bidding for a block sec. 5. the plan provided for in section 3 of stock of a given company. of this act shall set forth such fiscal con-
if the senator from kansas and the senator from delaware will stand by for a moment. i should like to say. while we are talking about taxes. that i do feel there are other things in addition to what they have committed as a retrenchment of expenditures that we have a right to ask for. and one of them is the closing of tax loopholes.
one of the big ones is oil depletion. which remains at 271/2 percent and costs $2 billion to $3 billion a year. many people question whether that much is needed. there are other loopholes such as joint returns. and so forth. also. many of us want to see a system of national priorities. i believe that the agony of the cities is as real and as pressing as the war in vietnam. i am ready to support both. that does  mean. however. that we have to carry it in every other direction at maximum intensity. including space techogy and everything else. so that i think the administration needs to do a great deal toward putting its house in order. i am  afraid to vote for a tax increase if my people feel that they are getting a fair break in terms of the ecoy and in reducing government expenditures. where hardheadedness dictates that it will be consistent with the national interest. closing loopholes. and setting up national priorities. until the administration does this. my guess is that it will  get its tax increase.
. the senator will ice that the last sentence of the recital in the report about this matter. which was included at my insistence. calls for a survey by the foundation and the submission to the appropriations committee for consideration in the next budget of all significant efforts on financing. public and private. going on . with a view toward considering the restructuring of the whole program. it seems to me that the strongest argument for the position of the senator is that until we do take a good hard look at it. the restructuring is in consonance with everything else being done. we should  rock the boat in this critically important area.
. although i am a cosponsor with the senator from pennsylvania of the original bill which is sought  to be amended. it is my judgment that the scheme adopted by the senator from vermont sharpens and makes even more specific the private enterprise job which i had in mind in effecting several amendments to the bill in its original form which i worked out with the senator frdm pennsylvania. i think that the senator from vermont has rendered us all a valuable service by sharpening and committing specific sums of money for that purpose. in many respects. this amendment proposes incentives to private industry like those i sponsored under section 123(a) (8) of title i of the act. and extends those incentives to something beyond a pilot program in size. he has limited the program to 1 year. i think that program is more important than that limitation. therefore. it shall be my intention to support the senator from vermont. and i hope very much the majority of the senate will do the same. i have examined the needs closely and i am more than ever convinced that jobs must be our first priority in attacking the problem of poverty. this bill would provide those needed jobs.
s case for a tax surcharge. should conditions continue to warrant it. the country is facing extremely difficult ecoic conditions today. even if a tax surcharge were passed. the fiscal year 1968 budget will have the largest administrative budget deficit since world war ii. even with a tax increase. prices may rise as much as they did last yearwhich recorded the highest rise since 1957. inflationary psychology is taking hold. cost pressures are increasing with wage demands far exceeding the  defunct wageprice guidelines. the new settlement reached between ford and the united auto workersan estimated 7percentayear increase in wages and benefits--confirms the seriousness of our situation. and interest rates are again heading toward the historic highs that were reached in 1966. whether a tax surcharge will be enacted or . high interest rates are going to be a fact of life at least for 1968. if  longer. clearly. the repeated and serious errors of judgment in the design and the execution of ecoic policy in 1966 have contributed to our present predicament. our ecoy is in trouble and restoring balanced growth is bound to be a painful and prolonged exercise. i support the mundt amendment because i believe. under present circumstances. it is. in respect of appropriations. the best way out. at the same time. i reaffirm my belief that the federal government. in close cooperation with private enterprise and state and local government. must accept responsibility for remedying major national ills. i believe that even under present circumstances of extreme fiscal stringency caused by vietnam. these major national problems. including those involving our cities and the poor. must be dealt with effectively. i believe that if modest cuts are made across the board. and we begin to work on making our tax structure more equitable and give serious consideration to a modest tax increase effective some time early next year. we will have dealt with the countrys fiscal situation in a responsible manner. should the steps i outlined be taken. we would still be left with a budget deficit of close to $15 billion. i believe that considering the costs of the vietnam war-$2 billion a monththis country could live with a deficit of that size. but a higher deficit under existing ecoic conditions is unacceptable. therefore. facing the facts of life. i shall vote to support the mundt amendment.
could we fill out the factual situation. perhaps it would help everyone. that is the reason i am speaking. because i have it clearly in mind. and i think that i am right. we have already reduced appropriations below the budget by roughly $2 billionplus--
three billionplus. the resolution to the pending bill may reduce it aher $2 billion. that would mean $5 billion from the appropriations. i realize that is  yet what the senator has in mind. as to expenditures. the budget called for expenditures of approximately $135 billion in which. roughly speaking. some 70 percent or better are out of current appropriations. and 30 percent. roughly. in round figures. out of previous appropriations. the proportions may be somewhat different. as i understand what the senator has in mind on this resolution. if the aggregate cut in appropriations below the budget. those already imposed and those to be imposed. it would aggregate $5 billion. the senator. withstanding- the reduction in his resolution. would consider that that met congressional intent.
in the early part of this fiscal year and those appropriations which carry over in terms of expenditures. on that basis i understand the senator from illis clearly and i think the senate does as well.
i realize how hard the senator from washington fought for the two programs as they passed the senate. i saw him in committee. although i did  sit in conference. i have had a blowbyblow description of everything he did. i would like to make it clear. first. that whatever has resulted in conference is due to him. so whatever i say is in way attached to the diligence. the good faith. and the effort of the senator from washington. he certainly did everything he could. what i would like to make clear is this. here we are again with what is definitely a wrong sense of priorities when we have a deep and pressing problem which is before us as the  1 problem. namely. the problem of the cities. the tremendous population shift which has taken place to the cities and is going on  has  yet been remotely recognized in legislation which has matured here in the congress. here in the model cities program was the really first comprehensive. businesssense idea of how to mobilize the full resources of government upon a given target. with the greatest possible coordinated result. and we have the worst fight made that has been made on almost any program. and the fight originates in the other body. which is referred to as the peoples representatives. because they are supposedly closer to the people. and the amount is cut from $262 million to $237 million. with respect to the rent supplements. again the same thing. only 25 percent of what was requested within the budget is granted in the final conference compromise. i could  let these items go by without calling the sharpest attention to the completely wrong end of the telescope view which is represented by cutting these two programs. which promised much for the cities. but which yet were cut to ribbons. ever. after the most herculian efforts by the senator from washington. before they could become law and have appropriations provided for them. also. i think a bad mistake was made. and i protest it. in striking out the provision relating to metropolitan expediters. i think the systems management idea on both sides. that of the receiver and the giver. is critically important to the success of a coordinated program in the big cities. in which every member must k i have a great deal of experience. so. more in sorrow than in anger. i say we are  as yet showing the understanding of the priorities which the national interest requires. it is most deplorable and regrettable that such tremendous cutting. and in my judgment in a discriminatory way. should have taken place with respect to these programs which are so peculiarly adjusted to the problems of our cities. namely the model cities and the rent supplements programs. i am grateful to my senate colleagues on the conference committee for preserving what they have. i k hing would be here for those programs if they had  done what they did. led by the senator from washington. i can only pledge to my constituents. and to the millions of others who live in the cities. which face such intolerable situations. the indefatigable and continuing effort to get within the schedule of the nations priorities such programs to meet those problems. of which these deserve the highest priorities and are really deserved by the american people in view of the situations which they face in the slums and ghettos in america.
. on the part of the miity. i rise only to confirm what my colleague has stated that this is a bill arrived at in the fine spirit manifested in the committee in respect to all matters on health. education. and welfare. on an entirely bipartisan basis. the report has set forth the detailed provisions which are contained in the bill but i should like to comment on just one or two matters. first. the size of the problem. it is estimated that three out of every 100 children born are destined to be mentally retarded. so that with the birth rate in our country what it is. this is roughly speaking around 3 million a year. thus. we have a very serious problem involving many childrenand a problem of great interest to the nation. second. as we are  making a great effort in respect of selfhelp. it is very important to e that the communities of the country are spending $650 million a year for treatment. education. and training of the mentally retarded. although these services and facilities are so far short of what is needed. it represents a very considerable commitment of effort by the states. municipalities. counties. and other political subdivisions in the united states. the senator from vermont and i. as our individual views on page 18 in the committee report indicate. take great pride in bringing the mentally retarded program abreast of the other programs in which we have provided  only facilities but also staffing. that was  the case in the mental retardation program. although we had provided such staffing at community mental health centers and sheltered workshops and rehabilitation facilities. we had  provided it for the mentally retarded. the provisions of section 4 of this bill inaugurate a system of grants for services in the community mentally retarded centers through the years 1968. 1969. and 1970. reaching a maximum of $14 million in fiscal year 1970. this program carries on after fiscal year 1970. due to the timelag and the actual taking effect of the money. into 1973 on a diminishing scale of participation. the participation begins with the 75 percent federal grant percentage and diminishes down in the third year to.30 percent. thus giving inducement and taking into account the fact that the local communities will do more in this all important field. we are respectfully aware that the support to which the senator from alabama has referred. from so many of the outstanding organizations in the field. is completely warranted and that the bill eminently deserves unanimous approval of the senate. which i hope it will obtain.
there is one. the correction is that it is directed at a rate of expenditure for the fiscal year 1967. we can pay anybody. we can do anything. we can fund any project except what is included in the total funding for the fiscal year 1967. in addition. we could  start a new project. we could only fund the continuing projects. with those two critically important qualifications. that is what we are contending for. that includes the compensation of the workers in headstart and in other poverty programs which are today being dismantled because the work. ers are  being paid.
there is one in this chamber whose approval i value more than the senator from delawares on such an issue as this. i repeat that the financial community of this country is really deeply concened about the future of this country and of the world in terms of the possibility of an ecoic depression or recession if we do  show our determination  to defend the dollar. that is why i made the recommendations i did.
this bill. which deals with age discrimination in employment. deals with some of the concerns of american business that the legislation would be open ended. these amendments are expressly designed to fix reasonable standards for regulations. subject to the administrative procedure act. limitingat the request of the senator from colorado -the amount that can be appropriated for any fiscal year for administration. so that there may be assurance that the bill will be tight and well considered. keeping also in mind the practical problems of administration. and will answer some of the concerns which have been expressed about it. . this is one of the most desirable pieces of legislation with which we have ever dealt. concerning. as everyone ks. a very grave problem in american community lifethe employment of older workers. i hope very much that the senate will act affirmatively. as requested by the chairman of the subcommittee .
. i shall  seek to repeat the arguments in opposition to the amendment which have been so eloquently made by senator pastore. who has done such fine work in this field. or by senator clark or by senator holland. but. rather. to address myself to aher argument of the senator from delaware which strikes me as being critically important on this issue. the argument is that because of the fiscal condition of the country. and because we have  "oted a tax increase. we must make this drastic reduction. we must bear in mind that such a drastic reduction would drive a great number of children and adults out of these programs. it would close down and deny opportunity to 135 rural community action agencies. despite the urgent claims that it is the rural poorand i agree with thatwho need a great deal of help from us which they have  received. is it the essence of the argument that. because we have  passed a tax increase. this money should be taken out of the backs of the poor. because we have  done what we should do. it is  the military effort. it is  the agricultural subsidy program. it is  the supersonic plane. it is  mass transit. it is  the subsidies to the airlines and the airports. and it is  other programs we have passed in the senate which should suffer. but the argument is that the poor of the united states should pay that bill.
. that we are dealing directly in the bill with more than 50 million schoolchildren. we are  an appreciable way down the road. especially when one considers the drying up and eroding away of taxing sources for our schoolchildren. but this. at least for poor children. represents the beginning of a coming of age. it is the largest education aid bill yet passed. i do  k of any better way to spend our money. except for survival. than in this kind of effort. in my judgment. it represents a comprehensive national acceptance of the responsibility for the education of our children with families and circumstances that are subpar in ecoic terms. that is the big thing. as to the details. we did have a tremendous row about the formula in title i. this is natural. well over $1.2 billion is involved in the current fiscal year. title i represents the heart of the program. the fundamental principle which i think was generally accepted is that the states shall have at least what they had according to the 1967 fiscal year distribution. this gives them the basic floor. above that the poorer states will begin to reap their greatest benefits based upon the average of national per annum expenditures on education rather than the averages in the individual states. that is  entirely equitable because there is standard of effort built into this formula. there should be. but it is  built in. it is a very difficult thing. one of the alleviating factors. however. is that the house accepted the incentive grant program of $50 million of which the distinguished senator from colorado is the author. it is an extremely desirable and worthwhile amendment. indeed. it does somewhat help us with the formula. which is  entirely fair. but the basic principle is that once the fundamental base has been met. the states below the national average in per capita education expenditures will benefit more materially than states spending above that average. in addition. i am still  sure that we are absolutely right about the billion and a half dollar cutoff figure contained in the conference compromise. from then on the formula which gives the greater advantage to the socalled poorer states will operate without any floor whatever in terms of guarantees to the other states. second. in respect to title iii which relates to supplemental education centers. educational parks. and so forth. we had a tremendous struggle over state versus federal control. the house clearly prevailed on that. there is use gilding the lily. but we did get some money in federal control for 1 year and a continuation of projects thereafter. it will depend on the funding of those projects in fiscal years 1968 and 1969 as to the capability for following this up. but at least it was a compromise. i think. in this case. that the other body prevailed far more than it should in the best interests of education. but. in any case. it was done and we have to be satisfied with it. title v also presented a very important and creative opportunity for us because it is the first time the local educational agencies were mandated to receive their share of federal funds to help them as we are helping to strengthen the state educational centers. we mandated that 10 percent of the funds appropriated must go through states to the local educational agencies. i had the ho to be the author of that amendment. and i think. generally speaking. it is a very constructive contribution to the bill.
if the senator will permit me. i will say that to make that distinction would take me longer than to make the speech. but without being facetious about it. i think that. by and large. the difference lies in how one votes on social welfare and international programs. i believe that this broad description is a fairly accurate standard. but.  has failed to face the issue of the priority which is required for the cities domestically and the priority which is required for the prosecution of the war.  have the people been advised that a tax increase isessential to the carrying on of the warfor some fear. perhaps. that that would detract from support for the war. the american people k how to face reality. and unless they do in this situation. the sacrifices and the unpleasant measures which face us will  be taken. i may  go along with senator williams in every item he has included in his bill. but i close. as i began. with the statement that it is very extraordinary and very indicative of the state of the country that two men like ourselves. of very great experience in this field but perhaps with differences in philosophy. should have come to sub-. stantially the same conclusions without any consultation with each other. if one really is going to do what needs to be done for our country. sacrifices are required. and sacrifices exist in budget cutting. in priorities. in closing tax loopholes. and in a tax increase. the degree to which our figures are in accord is also quite remarkable. i e the presence of the miity leader in the chamber. and i wish to say something about my own party. i believe that my party. as the miity party. has an emous contribution to make to the country at this time. what is the use of a miity party if it does  rise to the occasion when the occasion cries out for action. as this occasion does. that is what the party is there for. it is  supposed to follow the easiest and most pleasant line. but it must assume that the people have character. maturity. and understanding. as we. of very different shades of ideology in our partysenator williams and ihave expressed ourselves so frankly today in these terms. whatever be the political attractiveness or unattractiveness of doing it. i hope that this may represent a base for real forcefulness on the part of my party in the senate and in the house. i say to my leader and to senator williams that i .would like to see our party take heart. and. taking text from what has been said in the senate today. mature its own thinking. so that it can approach the american people with a program that is  safe. but that is right. and i believe the american people are waiting for that. this is a great service we can do for them. i believe that if we can benefit the country . it is far superior to any superficial political advantage which might be gained from the administration falling on its face. as it is very likely to do in many fields. due to the existing situation both at home and abroad. i express that hope to my leader. i do  look for answers this aftern. because it is too important a question and too deep. however. from presentations such as we have made today. from such divergent points within our party. there should be a proper incentive within our party itself to mold a body of opinion and perhaps even a party position which is essential to the interests of our nation at this particular time. in these very difficult waters in which we are sailing and with the very grave dangers which surround our country.
. as many of our colleagues k. senator yarborough and i are presently engaged in an effort in the appropriations committee to gain supplemental funds for summer jobs and antipoverty programs. the situation around the nation is serious. as certainly evidenced by the findings of the commission on civil disorders. and local program administrators are looking forward with dismay to a summer when they will have less money for special projects and summer jobs than they even had last year.
i thank the senator. and i thank him for working with me. the senator has said something about headstart which i would like to talk about. as to its desirability. senator clark. author of this program. is chairman of our subcommittee. in the main committee i am the ranking miity member. senator prouty is the ranking miity member on the subcommittee. i think they will bear me out that in all our negotiations with the other body with respect to the antipoverty program. headstart has been the favorite of all the favorites. there has  been a word of dissent as to its usefulness and desirability. indeed. one of the struggles which senator hill and i went through on the appropriation part of the matter was in avoiding earmarking funds for headstart. we had that problem in the authorization stage. too. there is such a strong feeling for the program that i think there is every desireand indeed senator prouty has been one of the champions of the causeto earmark the funds so that they may be spent for other purpose. therefore. it is certainly a program that commends itself on the highest level. there can be only one conceivable reason for the cut which has been made. and that is the ecoy proposition. but the leverage which is involved is so great and the critical nature of the problem with which we are trying to deal so affect the tranquillity and public order that i feel justified. matter what may be the ecoy considerations. in urging the senate to approve the modest restoration of $25 million for the 13.000 slots involved. the senate can see at a glance the emous leverage involved. let me give the senate an idea as to what the cuts mean in the way of contraction of these activities in critical areas. we are advised. starting with californiaand i see senator murphy on the floorthat in los angeles. calif.. the cut will be 12.3 percent. in st. louis it will be 10 percent. in oklahoma it is estimated to be 20 percent. in chicago. 8 percent. in detroit. 5 percent. in the state of mississippi there is a very high figure of 25 percent. because the program relative to the population is * very concentrated in the state of mississippi. in atlanta. ga.. it is estimated to be as high as 25 percent. in my own city of new york city there is expected to be a 14percent cut for every program with more than 30 children. these cuts may  be exact. to the exact decimal point. because they are estimated. and these matters tend to have a certain ebb and flow in the office of ecoic opportunity. but this is where the ax will fall. where we should be least willing to have it fall. considering the desirability of the program. its unquestioned excellence. the amounts involved as compared with the number of activities to be cut outin other words. the 13.000 places as compared with $25 million expenditure. the employment of 2.500 poor themselves in this extremely desirable activity. the fact that it is estimated that much less than half of all the children who ought to be served by headstart will  be served by it. it seems to me when we are looking ahead to a summer. for which we are trying to make timely provision. we ought to take up the slack represented by the unappropriated amount of $25 million. lastly. i would like to answer the question asked by the senator from colorado . although he is  in the chamber at the moment. he asked the question whether the impact of an increase in headstart would  come this fall. and whether the fact that it is funded for the summer the same as last year enters into it. what has happened is that oeo has shifted headstart money to the summer. and thereby maintains the same number of slots for the summer. but the money is to be taken out of the yearround program. and the yearround program will suffer. the fiscal year ends june 30. but that terminal date is only for new obligations. the actual expenditures for this new money will take place during fiscal years 1968 and 1969. if we give the added $25 million. it will be for the yearround program and will add 13.000 slots effective in fiscal year 1968withstanding the fact that some of the expenditures will come after the close of the fiscal year. that is the answer to the question of the senator from colorado with respect to the effect of this situation as it affects the termination of the fiscal year on june 30. so i feel this amendment is eminently deserved. the senator from texas and i made a very strong plea to the appropriations committee. we failed. the only reason i myself did  present the amendmentand i am very pleased the senator from pennsylvania has and i congratulate him for presenting itis that i have had my day in appearing before the appropriations committee on the job program. the senate has the power and the right to do what it deems wise and appropriate. and i think the senate would be most wise in this respect in doing what the committee. unhappily. would  do.
i think it is fair to say that the senate has complete discretion in this matter. because what is to be done by the $75 million and what is to be done by the $25 million are very different. both are a major contribution. in my honest judgment. to what we will face this summer. i felt very strongly about the jobs and about headstart. the committee agreed with us on the jobs and did  agree with us on headstart. but i think it is very important to emphasize to the senate that. in my own judgmentand i think i am a pretty wellinformed witness in this matterthese are both extremely important and extremely desirable. and that the senate. in my judgment. should really feel perfectly free to make its contribution to the effort to alleviate the problems we face. and that this would be a major contribution.
 should do. it is one of those hard facts of life. i would stand for a tax surcharge. plus a cutting of the expenditures. plus a restoration in the order of priorities. and that cut would be approximately $4.5 billion. and that is about the order of priority that the senator from iowa wants.
the first question i should like to ask the senator is: is it  a fact that the reason the president can cut expenditures below the items in the budget is that they are automatic expenditures. except for those concerning vietnam.
representing. as i do. a great state with several major cities. i am one of those who are identified by the senator from new hampshire as feeling that when the breath of hot summer is upon us. some of these resolutions could wilt. so. i should like to provide against that. i am going to make some suggestions. as a practical matter for it. but. is  the real deficiency in what the senator has proposed to us. because he has locked in the situationand he has as much brains as anyone. and he ks itand the situation is that the president will be cutting. and the appropriations committee. of which i am a member. can also cut the obligational authority. we can do that in any appropriation bill. as we often do. so we have egh control. but what we are doing is giving the president power and control which we have. and which we will have. and which we can exercise over and above what we do ourselves. this troubles me very deeply. for this reason: that if we should decide. in the .interest of high national priority. that we do want to do something about the situation. about housing. about jobs. the war on poverty. or the prevention and detection of crime. which is pretty hot business around here. then we should decide if we are going to allocate so much money for it. the president. etheless. within the limits of the $6 billion. can say. "ok. fellows. you gave me this authority. i am  going to spend this money." this goes to one thing that we have  discussed. if i may say so to the senator from delaware. we have discussed taxes and we have discussed expenditures. but we have  discussed priorities. the real nubbin. the real heart. of americas fiscal dilemma is priorities. we are going to permit the president to take hing out of space but allow him to eliminate. the appropriation for poverty. this proposal would  prevent the president from doing that. he would be able to cut out the whole amount-$2 billion. hing could be more outrageous. but by voting for this proposal the president would be permitted to do that. this problem deeply concerns me. it seems to me the proposal of the senator of louisiana . which has plenty of "bugs." at least preserves our power. along with the presidents power. it is true that the president does  have to spend the money we appropriate. but it is also true that we are  giving him a mandate as to the extent of the limitations of the $6 billion cut. matter how much we ecoize. this bothers me considerably. i wish to ask the senator whether. in his thinkingbecause he is a very thoughtful man and this has been a labor of great intellectual consequence. and i respect him emouslyhe gave consideration to that concept and what. if anything. we can do about it.
. i just wish to say to them that i hope that we realize the meaningfulness of this matter to people generally. we have had an emous -amount of maili am sure the senators have. i shall take the senators suggestion. but i just wish to comment to both senatorswho are so important in the conference. in the future work of the finance committeehow important many people in the country consider such an amendment. because there is much feeling that at one and the same time that they are going to pay a bigger tax bill. at least we should try to do away with many discriminations and inequities in the tax code. you never get rid of all of them. and you probably never will get rid of a majority of them. some effort in that regard is clearly indicated. in common decency to the millions of americans who feel much put upon when their own tax bill is going to rise materially. i am grateful to both senators. i am realistic about the legislative process. and i would hope very much that they would consider this as an expression of what the people really want. whether it finds its way in this particular measure. at this time. or in some other measure. this is something which is desirable on the part of millions of americans.
may i finish. . in proposing the modification of my amendment. which i will do in a moment. and in acting as i am. i am  trying to prejudge anything. the view of senators as to what should be included in a tax reform package will have plenty of time to manifest itself. i wish to make clear to the senator from louisiana that i am  adopting the argument of the senator from pennsylvania as part of the argument for this particular measure. so there is legislative record on that subject. i am perfectly willing to consider whatever the administration sends us. and then we will use our own wit and good judgment on it. it so happens that my own attitude on that subject was somewhat more favorable to the position of the senator from delaware than to the position of the man-. ager of the bill. but it is  material . the administration may recommend things which i will find very onerous and which the senator from pennsylvania will find very onerous. on totally different subjects. we all k that the matter has been studied for some time. as to what aspects of the tax code require modification. as a matter of fact. many of us believe that they have it on the desk . and that the only reason they have  sent it to us is that they want this 10percent tax surcharge. well. this is life. i believe that what the senator has suggested. considering the political realities. is probably the best we can get. therefore. i hope we will all save our time and tempers. instead of arguing about the details of tax reform. and agree that it is desirable to get a statement of the position. therefore. i modify my amendment in accordance with the modification i have sent to the desk. which i ask the clerk to read.
. outside of vietnam. from the national defense establishment would be available cuts in vietnam defense spending of $54 billion. that is in the budget outlay table on page 25 of the budget. overall defense expenditures for fiscal year 1969 are estimated at $79.8 billion.
 may  cut these items. however. he still would have some $87odd billion open to him to cut. of that amount. about $50 billion is for defense other than vietnam. the remaining amount under budget control would be something in the neighborhood of $31 or $32 billion.
the amendment covers it. but my chart does . and i am correcting the chart. my amendment covers it. it has one word. "education." i am basing my amendment on the budget. i have said so. that is my legislative history. the budget carries higher education.
i realize that. but i am just giving my budget figures. therefore. the aggregate figure which should appear on the chart is $7.8 billion. i ask unanimous consent that the corrected chart be printed at this point in the record.
. it had been my hope to be able to submit. as an amendment to the proposed legislation before the senate. the proposal i introduced on march 9 of last year for myself and the distinguished senator from missouri which would give the disabled an income tax deduction of up to $600 to cover transportation to and from work and to allow them the additional $600 tax deduction  given to the blind. this proposal. s. 1239. and its predecessor bills has had editorial support ranging from the new york times to the progressive farmer. cxiv538--part 7 endorsement from the aflcio. the vfw. the general federation of womens clubs. the national association of social workers. and the national council of churches of christ. and. in 1966. some 30 govers indicated to the joint handicapped council their support. regrettably. as has  become quite apparent. it is  feasible to submit s. 1239 as an amendment to h.r. 15414. the bill  before the senate. as had been my original hope. however. it is my intention to press my handicapped persons tax proposal as an amendment to the first tax measure to come before the senate where such an amendment would be feasible. what would be done through s. 1239 would be to help handicapped individuals to help themselves and aid them to achieve some personal independence from institutions. from overburdened families. and from local and state governments. such legislation is as harded and practical in ecoic terms as it is humanitarian. a practical bill to benefit those who have alternative but to be practical. the distinguished medical writer. dr. howard a. rusk. described. in a new york times article. the "inequities of our present tax system. which discriminates against the severely handicapped." the facts detailed by dr. rusk and the conclusions drawn argue eloquently for enactment of legislation similar to s. 1239. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
. third. it is very important to avoid a credit squeeze. which would occur if we rely solely on a tight money policy to reduce inflation. in the short space of 3 years heavy demands on the capital markets to finance the federal deficit accounted for an increase in prices and inflation of a total of about 10 percent. which is absolutely unheard of in modern times in this country. fourth. the fiscal year budget deficit of $20 billion is just unacceptable to the world in terms of the confidence in the american dollar. strengthening confidence in the american dollar is absolutely essential both to our export and import trade and to the raw materials which we must purchase in the world. without which the american industrial machine would grind to a halt. and if we have to overpay in dollars for those raw materials. that puts us even further out of competition in the export markets of the world and worsens our balance of payments.
fifth. we have undertaken. and quite properly. an implied commitment both at basel and stockholm and in the other countries which hold dollar surpluses in their international paymentswhereas we have been running substantial payments deficitsthat we would bring our fiscal situation under control. we asked that other countries and those other central bankers to hold our hands. the clear implicationand i am  privy to those secrets. and perhaps it was really very solemnly expressedat basel and stockholm was that within a measurable time lag. congress would take action to put americas financial house in order. this amendment represents such action. sixth. we must reduce our budget deficit to meet the growth of american ecoy to continue to grow with the minimum of inflation. we have been growing at the rate of approximately 60 percent of what we ought to grow3.3 percent. and  5 percent. finally. it is most illuminating to all of us that in political season and out. and though lateand it is late and the administration should be sharply condemned for thatetheless the president has consistently called upon the country. when he was thought to be a candidate and when he said he was  going to be a candidate. for this measure as the basic rock on which to build in physical and ecoic terms the country. i think the case is ironclad. i think it is as strong as it can be.
. i introduce a bill. upon which provisions the senate voted with respect to the recent tax bill. and which failed by only four votes. dealing with a commission to have constant surveillance over the reorganization of the federal government. i ask unanimous consent that the bill. which i introduce on behalf of myself and the senator from iowa . the senator from idaho . and the senator from illis . may be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.
i am sorry. . . i think we might just as well lock horns on that. as we have locked horns on the general issue of policy as to where this country is going. whether we are going to be fearful of the actions which the country requires. or whether we are going to be brave egh to take them. the senate has been brave egh. the house of representatives has . the issue has got to be fought out on this matter. just as it is being fought out on the tax increase and on the expenditure reduction
. i said exactly what i meant. and i think it took into account fully everything that has been said by the senator from florida. when i said that the spirit of house joint resolution 888 in my judgment. is being  violated. and that this was  holy writ that we had passed. and. second. that we were locked in difference with the house of representatives on the policy to be pursued for the future in terms of our being ready and willing to pass a tax increase and their  being ready and willing to pass a tax increase. moreover. we might just as well be deadlocked on the issue of these appropriations. since it would be too late if they were made later on the next supplemental appropriation. if they were made later at all. which i doubt very much. i think that probably all senators present would agree that if we do  force a showdown  as far as the job money is concerned. it does provide a bridge into fiscal year 1969. those funds are designed for the summer. and. therefore. they fall outside the letter if  the spirit of house joint resolution 888
. i wish to express my appreciation to the senator for his splendid part in this debate. let us remember that it was upon the senators motion that the $25 million was added for headstart. there have been other senators who have played extremely helpful roles in this matter. including. may i say. the senator from west virginia who was most helpful in our successful effort in the senate committee in gaining the $75 million for summer jobs. as to headstart. though it is a multimilliondollar programto wit. a $325million programit is being cut by about the 13.000 slots and the 2.500 jobs for the poor. i hope very much that the senate will listen to. the senator from pennsylvania. i hope also that the senate will reject. the conference report.
i thank the senator. i think it is fair to say that. whatever words were uttered. the spirit and heart of it is that we have a deep feeling that these matters are essential. and this is the moment in which to deal with the question. events will catch up with a new conference. just as is  happening in what was generally thought to be a throwaway proposition. an increase in taxes and a decrease in expenditures in an excise tax bill. the aftermath of the terrible situation the country is faced with will focus the attention of the president and the conferees on this matter. if we close the door on it. it may be 6. 8. or 10 weeks before we can act. much too late to take any action. that is the real nubbin of the situation. so i can agree that sending the measure back to conference will be of great uselessness. to the contrary. this is the time when we should be in conference. rather than close the door. as is proposed. and reject the whole senates position. i emphasize that fact. because i think it is a decisive element in inducing the senate to reject the conference report.
. a very responsible government official spoke. what he says is going to be looked and listened to all over the world. i agree that our situation is very serious. but i hope it is  emotionalism which dictated the rise in the discount rate to the highest since 1929. because it is going to be too taxing and too trying for many people. for people in small business and people trying to get home mortgages. and for the whole business and financial community. i have agreed with chairman martin that we must have a tax increase and an expenditure reduction. with the valiant co martin will take occasion to put the situation in focus and point out that we are in a grave dilemma and terrible crisis. without any question. but we are  facing a 1932 depression and that we can act. and that action of a vigorous character is available. which can right the situation. i join with him in the expectation that action will arise on the senatepassed excise tax bill. which is combined with a $6 billion cut in spending for fiscal year 1969 and a 10percent tax surcharge. i speak only because i hope very much the world will  take from mr. martins speech the impression that we are helpless in the matter. that congress is mindless and heedless of what is going on in the country. and. second. to say that the rise in the discount rate is hopefully  a response to emotionalism. because it is serious and worrisome. and that there will have to be action by the other body as the senate has acted to deal in a direct way with this crisis. much as i appreciate the concern of mr. martinit may have a desirable effecti do  think it should be taken as meaning that we are headed into a 1932 type of depression. i do  think so. i am sure mr. martin does  think so.that does  seem to be the opinion of the most astute experts in this country. i very much hope that the joint ecoic committee will take aher good look at the state of our ecoy in the near future to ascertain what the effects on the ecoy could be of the excise tax. the surcharge. spending cut package passed by the senate combined with the higher discount rate. such hearings would be vitally important to guide the fiscal decisions of congress at this time.
 is to submit to the congress proposals for a comprehensive reform of the internal revenue code. this is an important victory for the american people. at a time when they are asked to undertake new tax burdens. they are assured that congress will within 6 months have before it proposals which will do away with many inequities in the present tax code. and spread more evenly the burden of heavy taxes among the american taxpayers. there are many areas ripe for reform and at the appropriate time i will make specific proposals of my own. this measure contains aher set of amendments which. like the expenditure cut. very directly affects our antipoverty efforts. as the senate will remember. we passed last year as part of the amendments to the social security act a group of amendments which. in my view. set the welfare system back by several decades in terms of policy and administration. two of the most serious of those amendments were first. the freeze on the level of payments made to states under the aid for families with dependent children program. and. second. the requirement that payments to fathers under the afdcunemployed parent program could  be made unless the father had a certain period of attachment to the labor force. the effect of these provisions is  really to force more persons into gainful employment. as some members of the congress apparently thought. but is rather to shift the burden of steadily mounting relief costs wholly onto the states and localities. the bill before us improves somewhat on those previous amendments by postponing the effect of the freeze until july 1. 1969. and by barring a family from receiving afdc only as to those weeks when the parent receives unemployment compensation. but this is only postponing the effect of bad legislation rather than curing the problem which the congress itself created. and these postponements. while welcome. are  egh. for the states and localities are even  gearing up for the impact of the freeze. and many have already begun to trim the welfare rolls and deny vital assistance to new applicants. we badly need a thorough overhaul of the entire public assistance system. and i am hopeful that with the report of the heineman commission the congress can next year make major progress on this urgent task. this bill also contains a technical amendment to the title 19 of the medicaid program. which would delay the effect of one aspect of the changes made in that program last year. that is. the provisions allowing states to buy into part b of medicare. the congress may quite properly seek to coordinate those changes with other federal requirements. however. the medicaid amendment in this bill does  change  does it delay the major impact of last years bill on state medical assistance programs. it grants relief to those states which enacted broad and comprehensive programs on the basis of earlier federal legislation. these states have been forced to cut those programs back in compliance with severely limited standards for federal matching funds. thus. further attention to the health care needs of the "medically indigent" is urgently required. i want to express my concern over the provisions in the conference report dealing with industrial development bonds. i supported the amendment sponsored by senator ribicoff when it came before the senate because i have long felt that many of these bonds have been used to pirate industry out of my state and as leverage against unions seeking to organize. yet. i did caution the senate at that time that in dealing with a specific problem. we must be careful  to use such a broad brush so as to invalidate some of the most important state and local ecoic and social programs which use bonds to raise capital. when the problems concerning the new york state dormitory authority and the job development authority were brought to my attention during the debate on the ribicoff amendment. i immediately obtained from the treasury department an opinion stating that the taxexempt status of both the dormitory and the job development authority would  be impaired by the passing of the ribicoff amendment. in addition. i sought and am pleased to e the inclusion of an exemption for residential housing which will materially assist the continued effectiveness of the new york urban development corporation. i am still concerned about some of these activities which are carried out by the state of new york. i e that chairman mills yesterday said he would hold hearings on this industrial bond question as soon as the various govers came up with a specific plan. i hope that will be prompt. i feel quite certain that gover rockefeller will urge his fellow govers to act as soon as possible so as to protect some of our states programs financed through taxexempt bonds. in the meantime. at the request of gover rockefeller. i shall soon introduce a proposal to amend section 103 of the internal revenue code to provide exemptions for bonds such as those to finance the building and rehabilitation of blighted urban areas.  by any means will we have solved our fiscal problems with passage of this bill. in addition to reforming our tax code we must undertake a fundamental reassessment of our national priorities as the first order of business in the next session of congress. if the new administration will  undertake it then congress should appoint an independent commission on national goals. we must then streamline the operation of the executive branch with the aid of a hoovertype commission. there is an urgent need for some form of revenue sharing between the federal government and state and local governments. consideration should be given to minimizing politics in the determination of fiscal policy just as we minimized politics in the area of monetary policy by setting up the federal reserve board. time for action on the ecoic and fiscal front is . the alternative is inflation followed by a recession lest we are willing to impose wage and price controls on the american ecoy. i. for one. do  wish to contemplate this course of action and will vote for this conference report.
let me say to the senator from rhode island that i had idea of injecting any political question here. but it is a fact that the house conferees said repeatedly that if there were any budget estimate sent up on this thing. they would act upon it affirmatively. we did our utmost to induce the government departments to make their own presentation. as they did last year. on that section of the special request for $75 million. i submit to the senator from rhode island that the way this is pieced together. it gives the appearance that the same number of slots were being provided for in 1968 as were being provided in 1967.
i will do my utmost to do that. it did  always work out. the last time that happened between house and senate. it was. i think. an impossible condition. i think the senator ks that i am  partisan. it is very much out of character for me ever to be partisan about these matters. the administration is  going to stand or fall on what it does in this particular instance. but the facts are the facts. the facts are that the administration in 1967 did ask for $75 million. and that this is a critical matter to cities and was so recognized by the kerner commission. we have had similar request. indeed. particular help. from the administration in 1968. i repeat. the administration will  make or break on this particular issue. it is a fact. it is a fact that there was support from the republican members of the conference. any more than from the democrats. so. if that is politics. make the most of it. that is a fact. that i deplore. but it is a terrible fact. in view of the exigencies. and i think i am speaking to it because i k that without the senator from rhode island. it would  be in this bill. again. if that is a political fact for the administration. that is fine. if the senator from rhode island had  been with me. these provisions would  be in this bill and this thing would have been lost in -committee. i am the first to say so. other men of good will on the democratic side feel that this is the right thing to do. what i am trying to point out to the senate are the dreadful exigencies involved. i am supposed to k something about life in the cities. i have said on this floor many times that a $200 million package would give us at least something of an insurance policy with respect to tranquility in the cities. that would include summer jobs and headstart. that would be $100 million. it would include rat control. and money for starvation where there is such malnutrition as to be starvation. that is what this is all about. it is almost inconceivable to me that we can. in an exercise of reasonable statesmanship. get that much from the congress which. in my judgmentand i say i think i should kwill go a very long way toward dealing with what really is a nettling problem in the cities which demagogs and others who do  wish us any good pick up and use as incendiary material for arguments to point up injustice. move people to anger and to feel that there is hope for them coming from their government. which results in riots. i have said this a dozen times. and consider it my duty to say it again before i sit down. i wish to say that there will be more indefatigable. devoted. convinced advocate of the effort to do something about this than the senator from rhode island. i thank my colleague.
. this project is favored by the state of new york. it deals with full development of recreational facilities at this particular park. the bureau of the budget has given its approval. and i hope very much that the senator in charge of the bill will feel it proper to accord it the same treatment which has been declared as the policy of the committee.
. the reduction from $75 million to $13 million in the appropriation. for summer jobsfunds to be spent primarily to employ disadvantaged teenagersprovides shocking evidence of the failure to comprehend essential expenditure priorities. again. i wish to emphasize that there was involved  only the tremendously gifted leadership of the senator from rhode island. but also the senate conferees. even though they voted against me. they stayed with me. and i refer to the senator from florida and the senator from th dakota . i feel senators behaved very well in this matter. but it reflects a situation in congress which i feel must be called to the attention of the country. number of tricks with figuresengaged in even by the administration. and there was a flurry of that under the signature of one of the aides at the white housecan belie the fact that this summers job program will be at least 20 percent less effective than in 1967. it is alleged that the number of summer jobs available this year is the same as last year. but the fact s thatin the hours worked. in the duration of the program. in the level of pay and in the diversion of funds from other important antipoverty programs--this appropriation has depreciated the 1968 job program by at least 20 percent. i base this conclusion on the authority of the secretary of labors own testimony. it is inconceivable that at so critical a timea time when our domestic tranquillity may well once more undergo a grave challengethe message has still  clearly come through that summer jobs constitute a major part of the answer to tranquillity in the cities. in that regard. i repeat what i said before: $200 million. wisely appropriated in a rearrangement of priorities. would have given a thundering answer to those who would do rioting and violence in the cities. such as headstart and summer jobs. $100 million. the starvation program begun by the senator from mississippi . $25 million. rat control. for which we thank the senator from rhode island for getting some $13 million.
the reason i worked so hard on the question of jobs is that we have to do everything we humanly can. congress is making a serious mistake because the jobless rate for negro teenagers in the ghetto varies between 25 and 40 percent. this rate is at least 2 1/2 times that of white teenagers. this is the area where tension and friction arises. as the secretary of labor testified. at least 150.000 jobs more than the 294.000 jobs provided in 1967 are needed in 1968. the fact is that the reduced appropriation leaves 82.700 young men and women who would otherwise be able to work in the summer of 1968 unable to do so. the 17.300 jobs that the $13 million will add. while helpful. falls far short of the critical need. . that the national alliance of businessmen. the urban coalition. and many individual governmental leaders are doing emously fine work. but we are racing the clock with this tremendous dissatisfaction going on in the country and the hunger for dignity which comes from work. i can only conclude that this unfortunate resultthe seeming inability as the senator from rhode island says--as if it were a brick wall. in trying to arrive at the legislative priorities in expendituresreflects. in my judgment the inherent difficulty and delay in transforming the legislative process from essentially a rural to an urban outlook so that congress truly reflects the fact that 70 percent of all americans  live in the cities. this is a monumental struggle which is in the peoples hands to correct. i hope they will  wait until the march of time under the oneman. onevote concept will correct the situation. i do  believe we have that much time to spare. i have already given the tragic history of this situation. i began the effort to appropriate $75 million for summer jobs on february 21. 1968 and the struggle has continued ever since that date. on april 10. the senate sent the urgent supplemental bill to conference with the $75 million for summer jobs included. but we met the most stubborn resistance among the conferees apcxiv- 1240part 15 pointed by the house of representatives. furthermore. we had help from the executive department. which failed in 1968 to do what it had done in 1967namely. to request that $75 million be made available for special summer job funds. todays result. although pitifully inadequate. is still $13 million more than the house conferees would have provided. i attribute this resultand i k senators love to claim credit. and i am the party in interest to this oneto the talents of the senator from rhode island . a gifted negotiator who managed to produce this compromise. but the resulting rearrangement of expenditure priorities reflects little generosity and less sense. i thank my colleague for his indulgence.
. we are anxious to preserve the tremendous range of voluntary efforts by individual organizationssettlement houses. ymcas and ywcas. and many similar organizations. if this program is stratified into the states. nine states. for example. have neither constitutional  legislative provision to disburse these funds to private profit agencies. that is the type of situation which caused us to develop the plan we have in the bill. the plan in the bill. it seems to me. is entitled to far more weight than has been given it in this debate. the bill provides that the secretary shall approve a state plan if he determines the plan for that fiscal year does various things in respect of this program. which. in my judgment. in every case are desirable. including the participation by local civic groups themselves in the development of what shall be done with this money. a very important feature is that if the state is going to run it. the state has to put up money. that is why the buyin provision. which will expand the program. by states which avail themselves of it effectively. becomes extremely important.
 yet. in addition. . i have pointed out very clearly that this amendment takes account of whether or  there are funds. because it says " to exceed." there has been more than adequate money in the last 3 fiscal years. and that is all i am saying . if there is . then the amendment takes account of it. and the secretary of agriculture will be able to do less than $100 million or perhaps.hing at all on the amendment
i do  say that this particular provision is exclusive. for example. if -the children who can pay hing. who do  have any financial july 15..1968 co inability. do  absorb the funds available. that is  the end of it because the section continues: the funds may be used to finance such childrens participation in an eligible profit food service. to assist in financing the purchase of equipment needed to operate such programs. and  to exceed an amount equal to two per centum of the total funds used under substion (a) in any fiscal year may be used in such fiscal year to defray part of the adminisrative costs of the department of agriculture and state agencies in carrying out this section. i could  say it is absolutely exclusive. that is the portion the senator read.
. i have very great sympathy with the amendment which has been offered by the senator from colorado. although i did vote against it last time it was being considered and i shall vote against it today. i could  cast this vote however. without expressing my profound understanding of what is here sought to be done. i think it has to be done ultimately. i think it is a question of time. and as we handled the upward bound program on the basis of a change to the office of education effective fiscal year 1971. i would have hoped that we could have effectuated the transfer of the headstart program in the same way by making it effective in the 1971 fiscal year. i have tried to bring that about. but apparently this is  possible because of the different viewpoints between the various parties in interest.
that is correct. except that it is allowed to be drawn out of section 32 funds. then it would be thrown into the administrative arena. because the secretary of agriculture is then authorized to use these funds without appropriations action. provided he can pass muster with the budget bureau and the internal business which goes on in the executive department.
the senator from rhode island has already given us the key to that. it is a question of two steps versus one step. i want the senate to act deflinitively. in view of the large amounts which have been returned to the treasury. some $227 million in fiscal year 1968. we have an estimate that there will be even more money available in the next fiscal year.
. i am from the city which is most affected. i ask the senator: is it  a fact that hing will sooner break a policy than inflexibility and failure to take account of a real emergency. and that this air control problem is a real emergency. that is what it amounts to. we face an emergency. and we are trying to conform ourselves to it. i voted for the senators proposal of the $6 billion reduction and the tax increase. and i did it in good conscience. i have tried very hard. in the committeesand i am a member of the appropriations committeeto sustain that view. it has been pretty difficult for the committees. a number of us have had a pretty tough time squaring the sustaining of that principle with our various responsibilities. but it seems to me that if in this matter the senators wonderful program. in which i concurred it is likely to break the back of the very thing the senator wants.
ial politics and move forward on congressional hearings and action. i issue that call to the administration and to all members of the house and senatelet us join in a broad. bipartisan effort to create a national development bank to bring jobs and business opportunities for the poor of this country. this is one new proposal that need  await the outcome of the conventions and the election.
finally. although the limitation of senator sparkmans amendment did  prevaili wish it hadis it the senators intention. as the author of this and the manager of the bill. that the federal reserve board shall operate in this field to a greater extent than that specified in the sparkman amendmentthat is. about $2 billion.
so if the federal reserve board met with this rule. it would certainly  face any opposition from the chairman of the senate committee or from the manager of the bill. and it would be entirely consonant with the policy that the author of the amendment and the manager of the bill. in proposing it to the senate. ask be carried out.
mr. presider supplemental appropriation into law on july 9. provided in impacted education aid f law 874-"to remain av july 31. 1968." todays date. ey. $4.983.809 would have b for the state of new york. administration has seen fi lease this money for eligibl tricts in my state and throughout the nation. school districts have relied on these public law 874 funds since enactment of the legislation 18 years ago. and deprivation of these moneys result in a serious hardship on them due to the difficulties experienced in replacing the funds through local and state tax revenues. difficulty is also experienced because other federal education aid programs are being cut back. some by as much as half from the previous years appropriation. thus. the burden upon the local school district becomes even more difficult to bear. it  appears that these funds will  be released by the budget bureau. i trust. therefore. that the budget bureau will  see fit to hold back other moneys appropriated by the congress for the purpose of aiding elementary and secondary education so as  to seriously impair the progress of education in the communities and in the states. to do so would be really false ecoy.
. i have asked for this time for a very specific purpose. i believe that the arguments have been made very thoroughly by the senator from maryland. the senator from connecticut. and others. with respect to the details of registration and licensing. which i support and in which i thoroughly believe. what has  been answered adequately. and why i have asked for the the time to do so. if i can. therefore. is the disquiet among hunters and sportsmen. which i have found upstate in my state. in campaigning there. which is very real. but which is completely misplaced and misguided. what they fear is  what is in this bill. of course. they do  k that automaticity of license issuance is provided. and that registration just means filling out a postcard. as you do to say you are going to attend the next american legion meeting. but even assuming they k that. they are still afraid. of what. they are afraid of what we are going to do.  in this bill.  on registration and licensing. but what we are going to do with what they think is the precedent set by this bill. that is what the national rifle association and all the other lobbies are scaring them withthat we are going to confiscate weapons. that we are going to tax the issuance of the license. and that even if we tax it as much as an automobile. they think that is a crushing burdenperhaps they are right about thator that we are going to do something else which will interfere with their ownership and utilization of those weapons in the mal way. i believe that the more of us who rise on this floor and make it crystal clear that this is precedent for any such thing. that we do  have confiscation or taxation in the back of our minds. the more reassuring to such persons it would be. we are over 21 and if we like this bill we will pass it. if we humanly can. and if we do  like some other bill that somebody else brings in. that seeks to charge a fee or places some other encumbrance upon the mal use of a weapon by a hunter or sportsman. we will vote against it. after all. we kill many things here in committees. by filibuster. or simply by voting against them or tabling them. i feel that the real key issue  in this matter is the degree of such reassurance we can give. these men are  afraid of what is here. or should  be. but they are afraid of what it may lead to. and i think they are entitled to the most solemn reassurance that the chairman of the committee or the sponsor of any amendment can give them.
i am pleased that the senator is doing that. as a lawyer. i believe he is right in his opinion that it is  vital. this fear is so widespread and so unreasoning. that we should dispel it in any way we can. i say to senator brewster that the commitment by senator tydings. senator dodd. and myself that this amendment  be used as an opening for a tax or a fee is important. and the senior senator from maryland implies the same thing in proposing his amendment. that is what these people are worried about. that this is just an opening which we are going to move at a later date with a tax or a fee.
 indicated that the treasurys recommendations would be available to congress on request but that he would  endorse them or make them public. i understand his  necessarily endorsing them but they should be made public as the basis for intelligent debate and action in the coming year. i shall do all i can to bring this about as soon as possible. congressional action in 1968 on the tax surcharge. on spending reduction. and on tax reform was part and parcel of a single package. and it remains so in
. the commission to be established by this bill would be the counterpart in the executive branch of the joint committee on the budget in the congress. which was proposed by both the eisenhower and kennedy administrations. in the present congress. s. 537. to establish a congressional joint committee. was introduced by senator mcclellan and cosponsored by 76 members of this body on both sides of the aisle. including myself. it was passed last year by the senate for the sixth time and is  pending before the house committee on government operations. the increasing inability of the congress to deal effectively. under its long unchanged procedures. with the increasing complexity of the executive budget was highlighted by -the fact that the session of congress just ended required 12 months to handle even the routine appropriation bills. which under the reorganization act of 1946 are expected to be handled by july 1 of each year. it is this kind of congressional budgetary paralysis which the proposed joint committee was designed to relieve. and the joint committee would be a valuable adjunct to the improved executive budget techniques  being proposed. together the two bodies would assure that the constitutional authority of each over mid20th century budgets would be handled with modern. rather than 18th century procedures. one of the key contributions that the commission could make in the area of expenditure policy reform is to take a careful look at the uses of the budget by other developed countries as a tool of ecoic policy. countries. such as sweden. have made significant contributions to kledge in this field by successfully adapting their budgets to stabilize the business cycle and to utilize it to maximize ecoic expansion. without unduly inhibiting business and reducing the scope of private enterprise in their ecoies. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks an article entitled "the budget as a tool of ecoic policy." which appeared in the december 1963 issue of the oit.d observer. the official publication of the organization for ecoic cooperation and development.
if we dismantle this structure of international lending agencies or if we destroy it. we will reverse the very trend that we wish to encourage. and reverse the likelihood of our getting partners. especially among the industrialized countries of europe. it is extremely advantageous to us that they should come in as partners. if anything. we must increase. instead of reduce. the incentive for them to proceed in that way. in short. . increased participation by the united states in ida would  be a major factor in the u.s. balanceofpayments problem. it represents a critical element in american foreign policy. the measure proposed here today does much in having us go along the lines that we want to go. and it deals in a businesslike way with countries which we are dutybound. in the interest of peace. to aid. it is said that india gets a good deal of ida credits. why . we are determined to make india the free worlds showcase in asia. and a bulwark of freedom in face of red chinese expansion. i do  wish to be faced again. as a senator. with what i was faced with in 1948. when i had to face the loss of 400 million people and giving the communists the balance of power in the world. i would rather vote the money and the resources. within the limits which this country can do it. while there is time. i hope that the members of the senate. when they think about how they will vote. will pause to ponder this question: is india worth saving. or shall we let her go down the drain. it seems to me that when we begin to talk in such terms we begin really to appreciate why the expenditure of $312 million over a 3year period starting in fiscal year 1966 will  overwhelm us.
. i have outlined only a few of the many logs that are creating a logjam of malnutrition and are thus holding back the great streams of good health. mental ability. and human productivity from millions of american citizens. with this in mind. i cosponsor senator mcgoverns resolution. which will extend the committees life. to contribute to the objective that hunger and malnutrition will forever be eradicated from our midst.
subsequently said: . i wish to state to the senate that i have studied the amounts requested of the committee on rules and administration for the budget of the nutrition committee. at my insistence it agreed in a most solemn way. and i can assure the senate that it will confine its activities to 1 year to perform the ad hoc function for which it was designated. as the ranking miity member. and inasmuch as 54 senators supported the original resolution submitted by the senator from south dakota authorizing the committee. i must join with him in the expectationand i shall support him when the proper time comes--that all of it. be restored. we k that a prima facie case has been made on the existence of malnutrition. the preliminary report of hews survey team indicates egh instances of malnutrition. amounting to what in this country can be considered hunger. to justify the inquiry. the study will have great repercussions in the agencies of the united states dealing with the distribution of food. it is really a national scandal that. with our farmers doing the greatest job in the world in raising food and fiber. there are somehow or other pockets of poverty in our country where these shocking situations. have been proven to exist. i am satisfied that we can do the job in the space of 1 year. and i believe that the $250.000 is a reasonable budget request. considering the detailed and extensive studies which will be required. i join with the senator from south dakota in his strong feelings on the matter. expressing the expectation. although it is unusual. that the senate will act differently than the committee on rules and administration indicated it should. and i will do my utmost to bring that about.
 nixon. chairman mccracken of the council of ecoic advisers. secretary of treasury kennedy. and budget director mayo to deal with the prevailing inflationary psychology in this country in a fashion that would  bring about severe unemployment. a continuation of rising consumer prices would hurt millions of american wage earners. pensioners. and those on fixed income. an overheated ecoy would continue to undermine our balanceofpayments situation as a result of rapidly rising imports and of gradually declining or a stable level of exports. should speculators abroad suspect that we are  coming to grips with our inflationary problem. we could once again subject the dollar to speculative attacks with serious dangers to the world ecoy. so there are compelling reasons for taking steps to bring inflation under control. and. therefore. i supported the 10percent tax surcharge. i supported the reduction of spending caused by the williamssmathers amendment. and i believe that monetary policy should  run counter to antiinflationary fiscal policy. i am concerned. however. that fighting inflation may become a crusade.  only to our monetary authorities but to congressional leaders and private groups. at the cost of excluding or subordinating other high priority national goals such as maintaining maximum employment. ecoic expansion. and federal spending at adequate levels to deal with the problems that are giving us a dangerous crisis in our central cities. if we permit this to happen and lose our perspective and. as a result of honest error. we come to a situation of high unemployment and lagging ecoic activity. we would be doing this country great disservice and possibly irreparable damage. i speak . therefore. to alert us to this possibility. which could come upon us quite unwittingly. in the hope of conditioning our thinking. we should have this caution constantly in mind: that a recession can and should  be invited. because if it comes. its extent. acceleration and consequences could get away from us and lead to a depression. ecoic and monetary policy today is  an exact science. there are lags of unkn length before the effects of certain ecoic policies can be measured. ecoic data on which policy is based is far from complete. so. therefore. i urge the nixon administration and the federal reserve board to keep antiinflationary policy fluid and to take immediate steps to alleviate the undesirable side effects of tight money and fiscal policy while maintaining an overall policy of restraint until inflationary psychology has been dampened. and this. i believe. can be done.
to alleviate the undesirable sideeffects of high interest rates and tight credit on mortgage rates and on residential housing. i strongly urge that the federal reserve system begin to buy and sell the securities of fannie mae. gnma. and the federal home loan bank board and thereby perform a similar function for the housing industry that it does for the commercial banking systemprovide a flexible credit basis. i supported legislation proposed by senator proxmire and senator sparkman last year which would have authorized the federal reserve system to do this and thereby ease the credit squeeze on housing. and i will do so again this year. unless the fed does this on a voluntary basiswhich i urge strongly. we as a nation have set ourselves ambitious housing goals. and with good reason. our central cities are in decay and desperately in need of modernization and reconstruction. an overly tight monetary policy will necessarily run counter to this goal. and we should  let this happen. the rapid expansion of our ecoy over the past 3 years was only of marginal benefit to the hard core unemployed. deflationary policy may bring about less inflation. but it will also aggravate the employment problems of the hard core unemployed. of youth. and of miity groups. i. therefore. urge the nixon administrationand i will do all that i can as ranking republican on the committee on labor and public welfare to assist itto undertake a major governmentbusiness manpower training effort directed at these groups.  that fiscal and monetary restraint is slowing down overall ecoic activity. there are many approaches to accomplish thisdirect government spending programs. subsidies to training institutions. or tax incentives to firms who train such workers on the job. we should move along this front as rapidly as possible. there is a growing need to tie the federal reserve board more closely to the ecoic policy machinery of the executive branch and the congress. to a limited extent. this is already being done through the periodic meetings of the quadriadthe secretary of the treasury. the chairman of the council of ecoic advisers. director of the budget. and the chairman of the federal reserve boardwhich informally attempts to coordinate monetary policy with the fiscal and ecoic policies of the executive branch. congress. through the joint ecoic committee. is also overseeing monetary policy to a certain degree. as a result of recommendations made by the jec last june. the federal reserve board  provides the committee with an annual monetary report. which is considered by the committee at its annual hearings along with the presidents ecoic report and budget message. and quarterly reports on financial and monetary developments. i believe. however. that both these areas require more systematic approaches. on january 28. 1966. i presented a concurrent resolution to the senate which would improve on existing coordination between the federal reserve board and the executive branch by placing congress on record as favoring: regular meetingsat least six times a yearof the "quadriad". procedures which would require key administration ecoic advisers to keep the federal reserve chairman informed of any developments which would be needed to make possible the effective discharge of the boards responsibility. procedures requiring the federal reserve chairman to keep all members of the board fully informed about any. information received from the executive branch relevant to the execution of the boards responsibility. and ification of the president by the board chairman of any request from federal reserve banks to raise the discount rate. i shall reintroduce this resolution again shortly. i also believe that the annual and quarterly monetary reports being received by the jec from the federal re5:535 serve board should be formalized through an amendment to the employment act of 1946. which i plan to offer in the near future. on june 30. the 10percent tax surcharge will expire. should the fiscalmonetary restraint appear to be leading to an excessive degree of ecoic slowdown. congress and the president should carefully examine whether the surcharge should be extended. and if so. for how long and at what rate. it may be that this will be impossible to decide with precision. in that case the congress should give the president authority to vary the rate from 0 to 10 percent for a fixed period. say to the remainder of the year. president nixon made strong campaign commitments last year to do away. at the earliest opportunity. with the capital export controls imposed by the johnson administration. secretary of commerce stans told the joint ecoic commitr tee on february 27 that he is reviewing controls on u.s. direct investments which are administered by his department and that he favors their easing and eliminattion as soon as possible but that it was unlikely that this could take place in i would hope very much that these restrictions could be ended this year. for two main reasons. first. because we have  obtained significant concessions with respect to reforms in the international monetary system from our european friends in exchange for these controlsthe sdrs are still  ratified. the countries in persistent surplus are still unwilling to agree to a mechanism to aid countries in a balanceofpayments deficit position by lending some of these surpluses to them. they refuse even to discuss changes in the present fixedexchange system which has been under heav: attack in recent years. second. because it is becoming increasingly clear that restraints on direct investments result in loss of u.s. exports. i do  see how we can mount a major export expansion effort with any degree of success while we restrain the most significant element contributing to rising exportsoversea private investment. while it is true that we have experienced a trade deficit last year for the first time. it is also true that our private investments abroad valued at $80 billionbrought back $7 billion in dividends and interest and resulted in more than $125 billion in exports from those foreign based facilities. mostly for sale abroad. the u.s. council of the international chamber of commerce has developed strong arguments in support of ending controls over u.s. direct- investment abroad in 1969 and substantially easing the interest equalization tax and the restrictions over commercial bank lending administered by the federal reserve board. i support these changes in policy. there is a third danger from letting these controls continue. as arguments are developed in support of these controls by those responsible for their administration. we condition ourselves more and more to the use of controls which break down our natural distaste for controls in other areasvoluntary or mandatory quotas over imports. travel restrictions. wageprice controls. and so on. for the past 30 years we have constructed. at great effort. a forwardlooking commercial policy that looked with confidence on increasing international competition and the freer flow of capital and labor. there is grave danger both here and in europe that if we continue in this vein. we will fall back on restrictions in retaliation for the restrictions of others rather than to proceed to higher groundgreater monetary cooperation. greater willingness to let our ecoies adjust to each other. and through greater willingness to absorb each others exports and greater exchange rate flexibility. in the field of trade policy. we are also coming to a crossroads this yearwe have a choice between helping to create a trading system based on restrictions. quotas. tariff barriers or continuing on the road we have had so much to do with building of world trade liberalization. i believe the evidence supports the latter approach as being the more successful and productive and that is the policy i advocate. specifically. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an article published in last sundays new york times entitled "reserve under attack from friends." which shows that the federal reserve board has made plenty of mistakes itself.
also. i call to the attention of the senate the march 1969 issue of the monthly ecoic letter of the first national city bank. released yesterday. which in effect says that the probable cost of checking inflation raises the question of whether the cure is more painful than the disease.
. i certainly did  favor this restriction. it was one of the prices we paid for getting the bill. according to statistics for fiscal year 1968. cuban refugees are arriving primarily by airlift at approximately 4.000 per month. charging them to the annual allotment of 120.000 quota numbers per year. upon adjustment of status. would effectively reduce the number of immigration visa numbers available for other western hemisphere natives. as one who was a member of the judiciary committee at the time the immigration reform act of 1965 was considered. i can state that congress did  contemplate the extent of cuban immigration. for the cuban government did  liberalize its exit policy until after the bill had been passed. certainly we did  intend that fully such a large portion of this quota should go to a single small country. but neither would we want to bar the cubans who are essentially political refugees. accordingly i introduce for appropriate reference. on behalf of myself and the senator from michigan a bill to provide that cuban immigrants be admitted without being charged to the quota.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would establish a graduated minimum income tax. two new types of reports from the secretary of the treasury with respect to the cost of tax preferences. liberalize the general and minimum standard deduction to reduce the impact of the tax system on low- and middleincome taxpayers and would reduce the tax advantages presently accorded to minerals. especially for gas and oil. in order to provide a fuller explanation of the various provisions of the bill. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the full text of my testimony this morning before the house ways and means committee on this subject.
. i have been on the same committee with the senator from vermont for some years. the senator from vermont has constantly taken the position he has  taken with respect to the job corps situation. which has very largely developed along the lines he predicted. what the senator has developed in great detail and depth is characteristic of the fairness and preparation that have gone into his whole approach to the situation. because i k he would  say it himself. i should like to say that his solicitude for those who need training. and who should have training with the help of the federal government. is second to ones here. neither the sponsor of the resolution  any other senator. i k that his statement comes only after real study and with a design for doing a fine and better job. he is the primary author of the human investment act. which so many of us supported here. which is designed to attain the very purposes that i certainly think our committee is united on and which represents a different point of view from that of the sponsor of the resolution and those senators who have supported him. it is only fair to say that that proposal has as its objective the same effort to provide every young american. matter how he may have been situated before. the opportunity to acquire the skill and training which would enable him to share fairly and equitably in the tremendous productivity and power of the american ecoy. i congratulate the senator.
. this will do two things: it will insure that in the phasing out of job corps centers. the equivalenti emphasized that word "equivalent"-educational. vocational. and related training opportunities are provided for each trainee who wishes to continue that training. i emphasize again that word "equivalent." the amendment provides further that the aggregate of opportunities for job and related training under the federal manpower training program will in event be less in fiscal 1970 than for fiscal 1969. according to the table which has been given us by secretary of labor shultz. i ask unanimous consent that that table on page 225 of the hearing record be printed in the record.
i k that the senator would want all the facts to be before the senate. i might say to him. and i ask the senator whether he is  aware of the fact that the secretary of labor was asked precisely these questions in the sharpest way. it is only fair that. his answer should be incorporated in the record at the same time. it was the secretarys response that a budget increase of more than $200 million in the jobs program is being proposed. under those circumstances. one may differ with the senator. i have quarrel with the administration. i present my view. he presents his view. i have quarrel with the administration on whether the job corps can or should be shut down or whether this is the optimum way to deal with this particular problem. but. i do  believe it can be done on the basis of niggling and shortchanging. it is a fact that what the administration is doing is moving in aher direction in terms of jobs and job training. it is showing that by its approach to the jobs program.
he says as follows on page 228 of the hearings: i might say we are proposing an increase in the budget for the jobs program from $200 million to $420 million. tomorrow i shall place in the record the exact status of that request as compared with what they are doing about the job corps.
 truman money he did  want for bombers. time and again. he just left it in the bank. and there was hing we could do about it but whistle. this administration feels that it wants to recast the manpower training programs. that is really what is at stake here. the senator from wyoming was absolutely right when he said: let us look at this thing through the right side of the telescope. the question is  about 23.000 slots in the job corps. the question is about 23.000 training slots and how we will manage them. the administration represents to usand i think it carries weight because there are a good many facts to back up its representationthat it will redistribute the job training opportunities and give us a list. also. it will favor heavily the jobs program. the program in which private business is involved and under which the youth has a job at the end rather than training. which is the best we can say for the job corps. we must also consider the costbenefit ratiothat is the price tag and what it doesand the dropout rate. which is emous. all of these things have been debated here. it is more prudent and ecoical to reallocate and redistribute the available money. with respect to the chargeand i have made it myselfthat if we deduct $100 million from the job corps. how can we give more special training. the answer is that we add more than $200 million to the jobs program. so we are  dealing with the situation of putting the dollar above the man. we are dealing with a new administration which says. "give us a chance to show that we can do a better job. and train more people to greater effect and at a lower cost ratio for this number." i can help the group that follows the senator from california with the argument that it should  be done . i say we have to give the administration this opportunity based upon this showing. however. what i can help them with is the fact that the committee will maintain a continuing jurisdiction and surveillance. the administration promises will be carried out with respect to the dismantling of a given number of the centers and the redistribution of the people who want training to better effect than . the motion to recommit makes sense to me. without arguing all of the detailed figures which have been argued time and again. we should look the thing over. this is the sensible way in which to get results and give the administration the opportunity to deliver on its promise to the american people. they have said. "we will give you a better job and more people and more assurance of getting jobs in the end." the senate should let us do it and say. "let us keep a hand on the situation with respect to the way in which this closing is administered." that opportunity is given precisely by the motion to recommit. it is for that reason that i hope the senate will act in this way. i think it is the most prudent way we can act in a situation which. on the one hand. seeks to give an analysis upon this showing and. on the other hand. results in excess and inefficiency in the way in which the job is done.
. hence. the substitute which i have proposed provides first that any phasing out of job corps centers be carried out in a manner that will insure that equivalenti emphasize the word "equivalent"-educational. vocational. and related training opportunities are provided for each trainee who is enrolled in any such center and wishes to continue his training. second. that the aggregate of opportunities for job and related training available to disadvantaged youth under federal manpower training programs shall. in event. be less than that for fiscal 1969. the administration has presented a program which includes the closing of 59 camps. they still plan to add 6.000 slots. there are a number of manpower training slots available. let us remember that the entire job corps. even at the present rate. represents less than 10 percent of the total manpower slots for training available which is in the area of 360.000. it seems to me that a new administration should be given the opportunity to embark upon a new approach and a new program. the new approach comes down to a trade off: what we give up in the job corps training camps. we gain in other opportunities. remember. we are  god. we can choose child a as against child b. we must develop a national policy which gives voice to the national interest. it will help two or three children. it might be less advantageous for one or two others. that is to be expected. we can run it any other way. but what we trade off for the job corps slots is over 20.000 additional new slots in the jobs program. which has the great advantage. in my judgment. of giving jobs at the end of the road. the real problem of the job corps is that matter how we argue the desirability of training and getting people out of doors and taking them off the streets. the facts are that their training has  demonstrably resulted in jobs for them at the end of the road. on the contrary. the attrition aside from all the other difficulties associated with the camps. has been unbelievableabout threequarters of youths originally enrolled either do  attend or do  show up at all. fifty percent fall by the wayside. while $8.300 is the figure put on the job corps training. the cost of an inresidence young person near a place where he can get a job. comes to somewhere between $5.500 and $6.000. it seems to me that it is simply productive to bullheadedly persevere along the old line because. once upon a time. in the depression. over 35 years ago. we had the ccc camps. that is what it really comes down to.
i think we who are fighting the abm battleand i think that still remains the main engagementhave to be very careful about our position in the eyes of the american people. that we are  gullible. and i think the senators resolution certainly covers that in terms of reciprocitythat we do  expect the millennium. but that we want to stop somewhere. and we think we have found the point at which to stop. beyond which is the point of return. if the senator is correct in the cutting edge of his argument. which is that once we let mirv come into being for the russians or usprobably much more damaging for the russians. because of their opposition to onsite inspectionthen we have put ourselves beyond the pale of disarmament agreement. because there is way of dealing with mirv except onsite inspections. that is essentially the cutting edge of the argument of the senator from massachusetts. i do  k that i agree with that. for this reason: it may very well be that the united states would at all times insist on onsite inspection. if we limited intercontinental ballistic missiles themselves. it may be that there is automatic surveillance in any way that will substitute for it even to that extent. so that just cutting off the mirv would  be taking us back far egh. that may be. i am  saying it is. but it may be. in addition. we can discount the development of the means. in other words. in the last 10 years. for example. without disclosing any big government secrets. we all believe that the means of onsite surveillance. for example. even in the field of peaceful uses of atomic energy. have very materially advanced. i personally have little doubt that those means will advance farther. probably to include even the multiple warhead type of operation. i think the argument itself has shown. just . the concern. which i think is a proper one for me and for the senator from kentucky . who probably says things more kindly than i do. but really implied the same thing: that we do  want to get away from the main struggle. and i am  entirely in agreement with the senator from massachusetts that the main struggle does  continue to be the abm. but be that as it may. i do think that the resolution which the senator proposes. assuming the hypothesis that he bases it on. is certainly a fair one in reciprocity. i think we all owe aher debt of gratitudeas i have owed many. over a long lifetime. because i have served with him. man and boy. for 20 yearsto the senator from new jersey. for calling this matter strikingly to the attention of the president and the country. that again. itself. is of critical importance. because it may be that all the while that we have been fighting about safeguard and the abm. a few smart boys in the back room of the pentagon have been saying. "well. these fellows are a joke. when we get mirv. there is hing to be done about it. we have got to go on and on from there." maybe those fellows are right. and that is the plan. that may be what we ought to be deliberating about. whether i go on the resolution or . or senator cooper does. i do  think is very critical. but i do think the sharpness of focus with which the senator from new jersey has raised this issue. and the fact that it has been raised by him in a serious way. laying his tremendous prestige on the line. as it were. is a great service to the country. and i shall join in it with the greatest of avidity and cooperation. i believe that the greatest use of it is to keep us from falling into the pitfall that men most often fall into. which is  the one ahead. up the road. but the one which lies at their feet.
 puts that on every secretary. so that the secretary of labor has gone about as far as he can go in his survey of his own regional offices. he has turned up the need for $24 million. and he found some $16 million of that in programs where the money would  be used by * the 30th of june. then he advised us that an additional $7.5 million was the minimum required. of course. that is provided for in the bill.  we had almost a similar experience last year. when we came in very late and the supplemental appropriation was  made available until july 2. the supplemental funds were used. i k what our experience is in new york city. the u.s. conference of mayors figures represent additional slots that can be put to use under the management techniques by which summer jobs are given to the neighborhood youth corps in every one of the 50 cities. and the smaller cities. there are actually far more applications and people who need to be given the jobs than can be given. so it is very easy and quick to call in the people to whom this opportunity has been denied and give it to them. they are very delighted to get it. in addition. the way in which this program works  is that there are only about 10 weeks. with the $411 figure per slot. so there is still ample opportunity. before school opens. to use the money. furthermoreand this has been true in other situationsif the senate should adopt this $55 million proposal. with some assurance that if something better than what is offered will come out of conference. every city will keep a certain number of applicants on hand to be put quickly to work the minute the money is forthcoming. as a matter of fact. last year new york city put them to work. taking a chance on an estimated figure that would come in. that is the tactical technique. i will say that this is just about the last minute to get anything like this done. i have been around new york city a bit. as the senator ks. we have quite a mayoralty campaign going on in new york city. as a result. i have been around the city in an unusually intensive way. though i live there and k it. anyway. i am deeply convinced that assurance can be given as to which way the cities will go this summer. i think that in new york city we are especially fortunate to have a mayor who has a reputation for being able to keep the "roof" on the town. that will help us a great deal. but i still do  k. and i think. with all respect. ody ks. how nicely adjusted the temper of the community is. there is plenty of reason for frustration.  nearly egh has been done. at the same time. we do have some good marks for trying. and there are some visual evidences of our effort. i wish to tell the senator from illis that he should take tremendous satisfaction from his role in housing. i see it on every side. i think the appropriations committee has recognized it by the restoration which has been made even in the supplemental bill. when the regular appropriation bill comes before us. we may have a little trouble. but these are very good programs. especially the program for home subsidies. i feel that it is feasible and practical. as the conference of mayors has suggested. to act  on this particular supplemental bill. which has to be completed before the end of the month. anyway. for other reasons than this particular appropriation. we could expect that the money will be effectively used and that it will have a measurable impact on the situation in our big cities. i should like to point out to the senator something that is very interesting to me. last summer the neighborhood youth corps was very effective in "cooling down" our hot cities. this was  because they were vigilantes or were special policemen. but it was because they wore clean clothing and were in effect saying. "i am doing something. and the government is trying to help." this was very persuasive on people who were inclined to lose their temper and their heads. considering the amount involved. i think it is a desirable and wise provision by us. i shall put it to the senate in the temperate and modest way in which i have put it . like my colleagues. we are exploring a field where the difference between a situation of reasonable acceptability and one which is very dangerous to the country may be a hairs breadth. and this may be the breadth.
i am trying to draw on the senators particular expertise. the genius of the senate is that we do have men and women of particular kledge. rhe senator has been a very important business leader. and part of the effort to deal with summer jobs is going to depend upon businessthe national alliance of businessmen. for example. it is hoped that it will do much better this year than it did last year. the question i ask the senator. as a business leader. is this: would the senator. as such a leader. be encouraged to (1o more or less if we indicated our sympathy for expanding the program by doing somewhat more. some might argue that if the government does somewhat more. business will do less. i would like the senators view on that. as a business leader.
. the senator from rhode island could never be the devils advocate. i have served with him. and one could  have a better friend on the appropriations committee. or on any other committee. than john pastore. the senator ks i have tremendous regard for his judgment. i would like to submit to him the details of what motivates me in saying i can do it. first and foremost is history. the difference between $7.5 million and $10 million is de minimis. if we are going to be dealing in those figures. i say it makes little difference. we are talking about 16.000 to 17.000 jobs at $7.5 million. and 23.000 to 24.000 jobs at $10 million. and we have a need for 136.500 certified by the mayors. so the orders of magnitude do  jibe. then. history troubles me. i would deeply appreciate the attention of the senator from rhode island in this. because this is so much a part of our history. last year i was on the appropriations committee. and i was a member of the conference. through the great kindness of the chairman of the appropriations committee. the senator from georgia . and through the kindness of the senator from rhode island himself. as chairman of the subcommittee at that time. last year the senate voted $75 million for this very purpose. under. generally speaking. the same circumstances. it was necessary to get the conference report rejected by the senate. we successfully did in that fight. which was an absolutely monumental struggle. in order to get $13 million. at long last. of that $75 million. based upon that history. i would be very illadvised if i were to wash this thing out on that basis. i k that if i went ahead. the senator from rhode island would fight as hard as i did. i think he will agree that i fought pretty hard.
. we have argued all morning and the record is very complete on the question of what to do about summer jobs for youth. i proposed an amendment with the distinguished senator from wisconsin and a group of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle for $55 million which represents 136.500 summer jobs at $411 apiece. which is based upon a survey of the u.s. conference of mayors. the survey sets forth names and places of cities and the number of slots required for the 50 largest cities and with supplementary data for smaller cities. all of which make up the total shown. the department of labor advised me and the senator from west virginia that it could effectively use $10 million. they surveyed the situation according to regional offices. by region. and they came up with the $10 million figure. which i think is grossly inadequate and which the mayors think is grossly inadequate. the senator from west virginia then moved to substitute the $10 million figure for my figure. i moved to table that amendment.  out of any disrespect. but only because i did  think it fair to ask senators to vote against any increased figure for the program. that measure has  been tabled and so my amendment comes before the senate. i would like to add one e of history so the senate will fully understand the situation. last year. in 1968. we made a similar fight. a similar measure was bitterly contested here and it was bitterly contested in the conference. it received the kind consideration of the senator from georgia and the senator from rhode island . although i was the junior member. i was a member of the conference committee. we voted for $75 million. the committee was very fair. as a result of the rejection of one conference report we finally got $13 million. i submit. coupling what we are trying to accomplish with that history. that it should be remembered that the conference of mayors certifies this to us as the figure which can be effectively used. naming the 50 largest cities and slotting them by the amount to be made available to each city.
 shall submit to the congress proposals for a comprehensive reform of the internal revenue code of 1954. under that provision. which became the law. both the outgoing johnson administration and the incoming nixon administration sent their complete tax reform packages to capitol hill. i believe. in the same spirit and with the same result. the sense of congress commitment which i have offered as an amendment. and which i will offer as an amendment to this bill. will get us meaningful tax reform. the only reason for the difference in the terms that are used-"meaningful" is the word this time. "comprehensive" was the previous wordis that "meaningful" is the word which is  being used. there is difference in the content or meaning of the words. i believe the provision will get for us. in time. before august 13. extension of the surtax. and then we can have meaningful. comprehensivewhatever one wishes to call ittax reform. as to which congress will work its will before it goes home. i am therefore. offering this resolution so that it will help speed enactment of the surcharge and provide a concrete commitment to the millions of american taxpayers who look to their representatives in congress to establish equity and justice in our tax structure and to safeguard the ecoy of the nation.
that is egh. . i do  think the senator from montana will challenge my credentials for joining him in efforts to tax those who are   taxpayers and should be. or for reforms. including oil depletion or anything in that sense. he ks i will be with him most of the time.
i checked that out and i found confirmation in the financial world that our determination to halt the inflationary spiral which is raging right  was paramount. in my judgment. so i tried to adopt a compromise. i do  ask the senator to join with me. i only give him the psychology of one senator similarly dedicated to pledging our action on meaningful tax reform this year. i believeand i think the facts confirm my convictionthat we will lose more in the inflationary fight by doing what the senator says is morally just than by doingand i thought we could come close to realizing our moral obligationwhat we have pledged in regard to the surtax bill.
i think we have outlined the argument pretty well here . except for one thing. and this turns to a party proposition. the danger here is that this tax reform business. because it is a tough onebut i think its hour has come. that is the answer to senator pastorethe hour has come. and even the house of representatives has . through its committee on ways and means. acted to reduce the oil depletion allowance. that is the signal. the signal has  been flashed that there will be tax reform. but laying that aside. i would make the senator this proposition: frankly. personallyand i am the author of this whole ideai am  excited about it. though it is costly. we are paying the cost right  in this inflationary figure of a 0.6percent increase in the cost of living in 1 month. it is a terrible cost to pay. but i am willing to pay it with the senator if it could be confined in time. let us say. if i could have the senators attention. to a stated period of a few weeks or 30 days. at the most. it is costly. but etheless. there must be some way out. i think what worries people like the senator from delaware
. if the senator will give me 30 seconds on that. i have said it many times. but i just want to say it again: it is  the same thing. in terms of its effect on inflation. may i just point out that the.withholding does  assure there will be extension of the surtax. right  there is surtax. it may be withheld. and then have to be returned. if there is surtax extension. the decisive thingi am only replying to the senatorthe decisive thing. in terms of the monetary situation and the fiscal situation in our country and the world. i am convinced. is the juridical extension of the surtax. and the withholding will  do it. for the reasons i stated.
when an admission is made against interest. it is a lot more binding than one made in general conversation. i have one other question to ask the senator. it relates to the investment tax credit. the democratic policy committee refers to the fact that it will have an ex post facto application. in other words. it will refer back to april 18. 1969.
again. that had better be made extremely clear in all the give and take which  takes place so that the world may be warned about that date. that is the tradition in the tax business. even if one is  prepared to give warning. that that warning concerns a very important decision for businessmen. i hope again that when the proper time comes. it will be made very clear by the majority leader. the miity leader. the chairman of the finance committee. and the ranking miity member that there is departure from that respecting the whole ecoic community.
. i have discussed this with the senator from montana . and we have agreed that we would deal with this question in this colloquy. i have proposed an amendment which would make it the sense of congress that on or before the end of this session. we would consider a meaningful tax reform bill. . appreciating the good faith involvedto which i thoroughly subscribei only point out that the commitment to bring in a tax reform package. as it is called in the democratic policy . committees resolution. is only a resolution of the democratic policy committee and the democratic part of the committee on finance. i would therefore askas this  becomes part of an action which is against the interests of myself. who wishes to present such an amendmentif the majority leader. the chairman of the committee on finance. and. very important. the miity leader. and the ranking miity member of the committee on finance. would represent to the senate that it is their purposei am using these words very advisedlyto bring up a tax reform package  later than october 31 and to use their best efforts toward that effect.
. the senator from delaware and i have been arguing for a long time that it is essential. in the highest interests of all the people of our country. that the world be reassured that we are purposeful in our fight against inflation. as evidence of that purpose. it is proposed that we have a 1year extension of the surtax. i realize that we have the problem of a very nice balance. many senators feel we should hold the tax extension as a hostage for the purpose of tax reform. also. i feel somewhat obligated to give the necessary votes to accomplish the basic purpose which the unanimousconsent agreement would accomplish. which was done by all of us in concert. this is the only amendment i expect to vote for. i feel it is a visual presentation to the world. so critically needed in the highest interest of our people. that we are determined to halt inflation. this would be more meaningful even than tax reform itself in stemming inflation. therefore. i feel dutybound to vote for the effort to make this a 1year proposition. i do  think we need to hold ourselves hostages for that purpose. i accept the pledges of the majority and miity that we will have a tax reform package. i am willing to depend on these pledges. although to my people it may seem i am imposing more taxes on them momentarily. it will come out "in the wash" long before october 31. because i have that faith. i shall support the amendment.
i think it is important from the point of view of the business community. the other question is whether the senator proposes to include in the hearings the matter of modernizing the depreciation schedules. depreciation schedules are really an essential part of the problem of taxation. we have used the 7percent tax credit as a substitute for modernized depreciation schedules. in order to encourage modernization of plants. therefore.  is the time to consider modernization of the schedules.
. i hope that the decision of the administration to go ahead with the revised philadelphia plan will receive considerable support. in that connection an editorial in the washington post of sunday. august 10. 1969. characterizes the comptroller generals ruling as "sheer capriciousness." it also describes the revised philadelphia plan as "the most hopeful approach yet devised toward opening up jobs in the construction industry to miity groups." i ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a chart which shows the fiscal year 1969 appropriation. the authorization. the budgetstipulated figure. and the amount appropriated by the other body.
by way of facts. i should like to say to my miity leader that there is $7.900.000 that is within the ceiling in already appropriated money. it was unused in fiscal year 1969 for the purpose for which it was appropriated. the provision in this bill makes it available for this purpose. what his criticism does apply to is the difference between this $7.900.000 and the $15 million appropriation which was authorized. so that the difference is some $7.100.000 that would have to be appropriated. therefore. the appropriations committee. i might say to the senator from illis. will be able to determine whether that can or can be implemented within the ceiling. i should like to tell the senator from illis further. that we did take into account the situation to which he refers. i have described the way in which we hope to deal with it.
. passage of this provision may hurt a lot of people who could otherwise get loans. i resolve the equity in favor of the doubt which exists whether it would or would  get out of the committee. right  the authorization ceiling is high egh. the house appropriated $68 million more for ndea loans than contained. the budget provided $229 million against $161 million. but the authorization is $275 million. there is dearth of authorization. the same is true of the workstudy program. it started out with an authorization of $255 million. the budget was $154 million. and the house provided $154 million. the same is true on educational opportunity grants.
. the housepassed tax reform bill represents a herculean effort by the house in an area where reform is long overdue. but it also represents a challenge to us in the senate to bring to bear our combined intelligence to insure that this bill in its final form does  do more harm than good. for we can view this tax reform only as revenue legislationmatter how much we would wish to simplify the internal revenue code and close tax loopholes. there are fundamental questions of social and ecoic policy inherent in every paragraph of the housepassed tax reform bill. my remarks today will be confined to philanthropic and educational activities. but i will have more to say in the near future about other aspects of the tax reform bill in the senate this month. including. among others: entrepreneurship and investment incentives. changes in capital gains treatment. the proposed tax status of municipals. real estate depreciation. and the failure of the bill to grant tax benefits to the handicapped. turning to philanthropic activities. i believe that the growing role of government and its vastly increased range and expenditures dictate that private philanthropy needs to be increased proportionately.  decreased if the diversity and plurality that has marked our past progress is to be preserved and advanced. this is the social good which should be our goal. this is  to say that certain changes in the tax laws relating to philanthropic giving are  to be welcomed and that better cooperation between state and federal authorities in regulating the activities of foundations is  needed. they are. but the housepassed bill has gone. in respect of philanthropy. beyond reformto harm. the quite proper concern is due to the fact that some individuals have been able to use the present unlimited charitable taxdeduction provision to avoid the payment altogether of taxes and that some foundations have abused their taxexempt status. but this has led to provisions in the housepassed bill which threaten to create a veritable social overturn in the united states. by blocking the major flow of funds for educational and other philanthropic uses upon which a large share of the countrys private educational. hospital. childrens. handicapped. aged. and other services are heavily dependent.. i have  conferred with many philanthropic leaders and with some of the leading foundations based in new york city. and am convinced that the proposed tax changes as they relate to philanthropic contributions would dangerously decrease the amount of private funds available for purposes of education and philanthropy. i am also convinced that the proposed 7 1/-percent tax on the investment income of private foundations will also decrease the contributions to worthwhile charitable and educational programs without commensurate gain. i will  spell out in greater -detail my objections to some of the houseproposed changes in the tax code as they relate to philanthropic and educational contributions. we must make every effort to preserve the flexibility and the capacity to inate which philanthropic institutions have demonstrated in the past. these private institutions have demonstrated a capacity to respond more readily than governments to a wide variety of social needs. moreover. by their very nature. the private foundations are able to engage in experimental activities of considerable social value which public agencies can very well pursue. they can then become yardsticks as well as pilot plants for such operations. tax reform should  be enacted in such form as to destroy these characteristics. i feel very strongly that in our efforts to prevent improper practices we should  impose such burdens on the foundations as will inhibit philanthropic activities which are such a source of ination. pluralism. freedom. and creativity in american society. as the report of the house ways and means committee indicates. h.r. 13270 seeks to tighten the permissible activities of private foundations to prevent selfdealing between the foundations and their substantial contributors. to require in a limited time the distribution of income for charitable purposes. to prevent capital gains appreciation from being used also as a tax deduction when inherent in a philanthropic gift. to prevent foundations from engaging in or near to political activity. to limit foundations holdings in private businesses. to assure that their activities are restricted as provided for in the tax laws. and to be sure that foundations investments are  jeopardized by financial speculation. i support many of these initiatives. but am strongly opposed to others. in addition. the bill would impose a tax of 71/2 percent on the investment income of private foundations. statutory provisions regulating foundations to prevent any prejudicial involvement in political activities is appropriate. but broad inhibitions which would prevent such activity in the public interest as is essential and ancillary to their purposes. is carrying a good thing. too far. for example. to prevent a philanthropic organization from giving to a congressional committee the benefit of its expertise as. for example. in a child day care center. or in conducting a recreation center for the aged or a workshop for the handicapped on the ground that it will have some "influence on the decision of any governmental body" is depriving the public of an essential benefit of the activities of private philanthropy. when the bills proposals weaken the social mission of foundations and threaten highly valuable philanthropic activities they must be opposed. the problem. as i see it. is to sharpen our understanding of the abuses we are trying to correct without at the same time radically cutting large philanthropic gifts to educational and philanthropic organizations. to the extent that the bill proposes such increased supervision of private foundations as will prevent manipulations and selfdealing which defeat the purposes of tax exemptions. then it represents progress. private foundations should  be allowed to operate solely as vehicles for tax avoidance. but let us remember that to the extent the abuse is tax exemption for organizations which are charitable only in name but  in fact or deed. there are many provisions already in the bill to eliminate these abuses. these include provisions against selfdealing by foundations. and restrictions on business activities of charitable organizations. and requirements for distribution of income. the bill would eliminate the unlimited charitable deduction. impose new tax consequences on charitable contributions of appreciated property. and make it more difficult to assign income to a charity by use of a charitable trust. the bill attempts to offset the adverse effects of these changes on philanthropy by raising the limitation on charitable deductions from 30 to 50 percent of a taxpayers adjusted gross income. the motivation for these changes is certainly  revenue since the net effect of these charitable deduction provisions is $5.000.000 in the first year. $10.000.000 in the second year. and rising to $20.000.000 in 1972 and later years when the elimination of the unlimited charitable deduction becomes fully effective. it is clear that from the standpoint of the educational institutions and public charities. the increase to 50 percent of the charitable deduction limitation would  result in the very large contributions being made todaymany of which are under the unlimited charitable deduction provision. the questions would be. then. whether smaller contributions would fill in the gap. in the universal opinion of the institutions directly affected. they would  and could  do so for a number of years. hence it is the institutions that would suffer. and inevitably private institutions would be crowded out and more government institutions would have to take their place. the situation is further aggravated by the way the bill deals with contributions of appreciated property. it must be recognized that these contributions represent a major source of income to private educational institutions and colleges and that if such gifts were eliminatedand the tax reform bill as written threatens to do just thisincreased federal funds would be needed to support these institutions or the functions they perform. there have been a number of suggestions as to how this provision could be revised. indeed. it could be tackled by allowing the appreciation. in whole or in part. as a deduction provided it did  amount to a windfall profitbenefiting the giver more than if he had sold the capital asset. in addition. there is much moral force in the idea of eliminating appreciation in gifts of property to charitable and educational institutionsas distinct from foundationsin computing the "minimum income tax." or the "limited tax reference" or the "allocation of deductions" provision. my second major point of opposition is to the proposed 7/2percent tax on the investment income of private foundations. this proposed tax would. in theory. contribute to the objective of better supervising their activities and preventing the misuse of the tax exemption privileges of the foundations. it should be emphasized. however. that foundations were intended to contribute  to the public treasury. but to worthwhile charitable and educational programs. the proposed tax levied on the foundations would in fact be subtracting the amount of funds that may be made available for charitable purposes. for example. if the income of a foundation which supports the salvation army is taxed by 71/2 percent. it would reduce grants to the salvation army by 7 /2 percent. the federal government would be that much richer. the salvation army that much poorer. thus. this provision would effectively declare that the federal government believes it can do the salvation armys job better than the salvation army can. i seriously doubt whether this is the case and do  believe that the nixon administration feels that this is the case. it does  accord with the philosophy. which i support. of decentralization of the activities of the federal government. we should strive. in this tax reform measure to be consistent with the various other proposals we are presently considering that would return some of the power and functions that have accrued to the federal government over the past 40 years to the states. the municipalities. and to private organizations. as indicated earlier in this statement. i believe that the federal government and particularly the states must better supervise the activities of foundations. i would urge that. rather than taxing the foundations 71/2 percent to finance such increased supervisory activities that are required. the senate finance committee thoroughly consider the many alternatives to such a tax. it should be emphasized that since the passage of the first internal revenue act in 1913. the government has recognized the special place that private foundations hold in our society and has granted them taxexempt status. this proposed tax violates this philosophy and helps undermine the foundations which have played an important role in the formation of this nation as we k it . in addition to these major provisions in h.r. 13270 relating to the tax treatment of philanthropy and foundationsto which i objectthe bill also provides that a private foundation must distribute all its income currentlybut  less than 5 percent of its investment assetsand imposes graduated sanctions in the event of a failure to make timely distributions. these recommended changes also merit careful consideration to insure that they will promote the end we desire. in each case. we should apply the following tests to any tax reform proposals relating to philanthropy: first. whether proper activities of worthwhile private foundations will benefit from the changes in the tax law. second. whether such changes would enhance the prospect of the appropriate supervision of these institutions. third. whether abuses of the tax exempt status of the foundations will be curtailed without harm to worthwhile institutions. and. fourth. whether philanthropy urgently conducive to the public interest will continue to be encouraged. let us reform the tax laws in this area in such a way that when we look back on our work. we will  be forced to concludeyes. the operation was a success. but the patientthe foundations and private philanthropy--died.
. this morning i had the privilege of testifying at considerable length before the finance committee on the tax reform bill. i made this testimony because of the tremendous concentration of various elements of the ecoy. and of philanthropy both on the giving and the receiving end. in new york state and particularly new york city. hence. i went into considerable detail and made many recommendations with respect to the tax reform bill. as i believe that this is a matter of great interest  only to my own state but to all the states of the union. and that considerable expertise is reflected in the presentations which have been made to me by many diverse interests in new york. i ask unanimous consent to have this testimony printed in the record. these being objection. the testimony was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows: testimony of senator javrrs before appearing before the finance committee today. i have made a careful study of the housepassed tax bill. which represents an emous effort by the house in an area where reform is long overdue. i also have reviewed the administrations proposed changes as so ably presented by the secretary of the treasury david kennedy and assistant secretary for tax policy edwin s. cohen. and i find much wisdom in many of the suggestions made by the administration. i have had numerous conversations with tax experts. business leaders and philanthropic leaders and i have been impressed by my volumis constituents mail and by the lively tax debate raging in the press. in my testimony today. i have two principal purposes: i. to offer specific amendments to correct inequities in the tax reform bill (hr. 13270) or to offer other tax reform measures which should be included. and. ii. to consider the propriety of the ecoic effects of the bill in view of the current inflationary situation and to consider the revenue effects of the bill. given the choice of reducing revenue by cutting taxes or by being able to meet more adequately the acceptable demands on the treasury for desirable appropriatons. at the outset. we must remember that the most important thrust of the bill we are considering is its reform provisions. i am convinced that the citizens of our nation will support legislation which makes a serious attempt to tackle the abuses of our present tax systemeven if this legislation does  make any changes in the tax rate structure. most americans. i am sure. concur with justice holmes when he said that taxes are the way in which one buys civilization. right  the american people are demanding justice within our tax system by means of the tax reform billeven more than they are demanding lower federal tax ratesand it is this equity of treatment that we should work towards. i. therefore. fully support those reform provisions of the bill which would (1) provide for a minimum income tax through limitations on tax preferences and allocation of deductions. (2) remove 5.000.000 of our poorest taxpayers. whose incomes are below the poverty level. from the tax rolls. (3) reduce oil depletion allowances and intangible drilling costs. and (4) prohibit tax avoidance through the improper use of tax provisions affecting foundations. i also support the administrations recommendations on increasing the minimum standard deduction. however. in working toward the equity of tax reform. we must be exceedingly careful that we do  throw out the baby with the bath water. it is in this respect that i am seriously concerned about certain of the proposals contained in h.r. 13270 and also about certain reforms that are omitted both from this bill and the administrations proposals.
. i am grateful for the senators intercession. however. i do  agree with him. the secretary of agriculture under the potato bill is given the authority to prepare a budget. to fix the assessment rate. and to exercise other powers contained in the law. it seems to me that on the question of principle. it can be a private plan. privately administered. because if we analyze the power. the authority of cabinet officers and the united states is implemented. there is a question of power involved. the bill provides that a cabinet officer of the federal government shall collect what we could argue is tantamount to revenue. surely. they could get it back. some could get a rebate on income taxes and other matters. the fact that the machinery of the federal government is used for collection constitutes a matter of principle. it is part of the basic point. it is a critically important point for the senate. we find that with respect to many agricultural fields. a very important discussion is already going on with relation to the whole field. with respect to the use of an assessment of some kind. every time a broad plan is worked out involving this kind of mutualization of responsibility. we have to go back to the house of representatives and treat it as a new matter. the matter goes to the house ways and means committee. and withstanding the fact that the whole house and senate can work its will. we would be tying a millstone around our necks. we would have to continue to go through the appropriations and authorization route. we have. therefore. a question of power. the power involved here is very important insofar as modernizing the federal government is concerned. i voted against the particular assessment in this bill. i would have preferred a voluntary plan of some kind. i thought this was adding something rather heavy and weighty to the bill. however. i could  vote for the point of order. it is very likely that i shall be the first to vote for some important modifications of this assessment plan. i may. perhaps. vote to strike the matter. i do  think that is the point. the point is that the senate would be for the first time giving up a power which it has refused to give up before. that is the power to use means which are incidental to the main purpose. even if they technically may provide for the raising of revenue. the revenue has been clearly earmarked for a given purpose. and i should like to point out how tightly this revenue is earmarked for the given purpose.
. i might read one statement in the opinion which states: mr. justice story has well said that the practical construction of the constitution and the history of the origin of the constitutional provision in question proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word. and are  bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue. the main purpose that congress had in view was to provide a national currency based upon united states bonds. and to that end it was deemed wise to impose the tax in question. that is exactly the situation here. we have a health and safety bill. we have imposed an assessment. to that end. it is completely incidental to the fundamental purpose of the bill which we have an undisputed constitutional right and authority to initiate. i might say that just as the senator from kentucky. my belovedand he ks i use that word in his case most advisedly--colleague. feels strongly about the constitutional point and he must obey his conscience. i might say that i do. too. i am  arguing with the senate for a minute that any senator wants to do other than obey his conscience. but i point out that the senate should  be diverted by favor or opposition to the assessment provisions themselves. because a point of order makes infinitely deeper precedent than that. this case. unlike general legislation. is a case in which pecedent will count decisively because this is a question of the authority of the senate. it is  what we put in a bill. we can vote yea today and nay tomorrow. but this is an assessment by the senate of its constitutional power and its specific interpretation of it. i therefore appeal to all senators to understand very clearly the deep implications of a vote to sustain the point of order. which has  been done before. as i understand it from the research.
. the first amendment relates to an annual report to be called for from the secretary of the treasury which will give us an idea. which we seemingly lack. of what will be the revenue loss of the various provisions of the income tax code relating to exclusions. deferrals. and other types of special treatment usually found in our income tax laws. the amendment reads as follows: the following new section is to be added at the end of the bill:
. finally. i submit an amendment which relates to section 331 of the internal revenue code. the main question involved is the retroactivity of the senate finance committee amendment which relates to tax free redemption of stock by corporations in exchange for appreciated property. the committee has made the operative date october 9. 1969. but because of the failure of the committee press release to indicate that this applied to corporations generally prevented most everyone from king that this applied to them until the bill was explained in the committee summary on ember 18. i am hopeful that the committee may find it appropriate to set the date at the date the bill was presentedwhen the public was generally informed of itthat is on ember 18. 1969. (the amendment reads as follows:) on page 524. line 11. delete: the date "october 9. 1969." and insert in lieu thereof the following: "ember 18. 1969."
. these are serious questions. however. beside the other areas to which i referred. there is also a serious question as to whether particular foundations or philanthropic enterprises shall be limited or restricted in the amount of a particular enterprise. they may own. i understand why we want to be careful to avoid control by foundations or philanthropic organizations of the operating enterprises. but i can see why we should have any particular concern about how much of those enterprises they own in the absence of the exercise of active control which prejudices charitable purposes. this also mitigates against substantial gifts. the practicality of getting the most for philanthropic purposes may dictate the absence of such a restriction which would cancel the possibility of getting the most for these highly desirable purposes. finally. i think we must be leery of allowing the inequities. the excesses. the abuses. which may have arisenand we have far too little evidence on thisfrom changing the fundamental concept. which we have had in mind so long in this country. this concept has worked well. it has tended to enle our people. as well as to do highly desirable social things which our people eventually need to have done. we must be careful of restraints and restrictions so designed to deal with the excesses and abuses as to literally throw out the baby with the bath. and end what has been so fundamentally an element worthy of praise in the american system. next week and the week after major amendments to the tax reform bill will be forthcoming. i urge senators to think during the thanksgiving recess about this problem of foundations and philanthropic giving. if it is practical. i hope they are able to give some attention to the home community. hospitals. community chest. foundations. and other philanthropic activities which are recipients of this kind of giving. and also with givers themselves. large and small. in order to determine for themselves what should be done in the way of a fair effort to deal with the abuses and excesses. but at the same time. to be sure in the correction of doing that we are  jeopardizing a fundamental institution. philanthropic giving. which is an essential element of our society. i hope senators will be thoughtful in this matter. i have made these remarks in an effort to encourage them to do so in the next few days.
. i have  participated in this particular aspect of the debate. but i do wish to record my views for the benefit of the senate and my own constituents. i wanted to support senator percys amendment as the lesser of two evils. my difficulty isif it were carriedit would  be voted on again. on the fundamental proposition of tax reduction under the guise of a tax reform. i must say that the position taken by the senator from delaware. by other senators. by myself and by my own constituents. makes much more sense. what we started to do was legislate tax reform and here we are legislating tax reductionthis does hing to distribute the income tax burden more equitably among our citizens. in addition. this type of tax reduction produces far greater tax benefits for higher income taxpayers and may therefore undo what we are really trying to domake the tax burden for all taxpayers more equitable. the gore amendment also would work inequitable tax effects for the single taxpayer. the average married couple without children. and even the middleincome taxpayer with two children. we also have  deliberated or discussed its ecoic effect. and its ecoic effect is going to be bad. for whatever it is worth to the senatei come from a highly populous state. having only two senators but 41 representativesi do  think the people of my state sent me here to be foolish. i believe the people of my state understand that we can correct the whole inflationary situation by these votes. but i was  sent here to worsen it and the amendments we are considering would do just that. it is my profound judgment that we will seriously worsen the inflationary situation in our country. and will lose infinitely more for the very same families that we think we are going to benefit. if we at this time make a taxreform bill into a taxcutting bill. i hope the senate will  do that.
to do something of an original and affirmative character. i have prepared an amendment to phase out the investment tax credit for everyone. conditioned upon the promulgation of new depreciation schedules by the treasury department which would coincide with the need for modern standardization and techogy. this is infinitely more important to the competitive quality of american business at home and abroad than the investment tax credit. and is so generally recognized. the treasury has grave problems with this proposition. the best they have been able to do is to make available by june 30. 1970. a study of various alternative proposals for depreciation reform and the estimated revenue effect thereof. after consultation with the senator from louisiana and the senator from delaware . i felt that i should go along with that. they assured me that it will work out better that way. and i think they are right. king that the committee itself. as expressed to me by the majority and miity members. is very deeply interested and sees very clearly the aspect of this matter which has so great a bearing on the american business system. i am satisfied that this is the proper route. to get the alternatives. then. taking common consultation with the committee. i think that we can get the treasury department to go one of these alternative routes which will do for american business what it so urgently needs at the present timeboth for small and big business. the idea of having an opportunity under revised depreciation schedules to modernize and automate is probably one of the greatest real elements of the strength of our country which. in the final analysis. matter what is said about inflation. money. or fiscal policy. depends upon its industrial and productive strength. i am sure the chairman will agree with me. . i ask unanimous consent that the letter from charles e. walker. the acting secretary be printed in the record as part of my remarks in connection with the discussion with my friend. the senator from nebraska.
. i am pleased to join the distinguished senator from arizona a member of the finance committee. in the sponsorship of this amendment to provide a tax deduction for transportation expenses to and from work for the handicapped. as the senator ed. the amendment before us is a compromise provision worked out by the committee. for me. it is the culmination of an effort begun when. as a member of the house. i introduced a similar proposal in the 81st congress in 1950. our handicapped citizens are capable of being productive workers. contributing to the nations ecoy instead of being dependent upon it. but their disabilities impose upon them additional expenses in pursuit of their livelihoods which are  fully tax deductible such as extra travel costs because they are unable to utilize routine methods of transportation. i am heartened by the support for this amendment. hundreds of thousands of americans have endeavored valiantly to transform their physical handicaps from stumbling blocks to building blocks. they wish to use their crutches to move on.  to lean on. this amendment will help them do just that. it is as practical in ecoic terms as it is humanitarian. it is. in effect. a practical provision to benefit those who have alternative but to be practical. i am very hopeful  only that the amendment will be agreed to. but also. since it is critically important. that it actually survive the conference and become at long last part of our basic tax law.
. the real essence of this debate is that this is  a tax reform question but rather a sociological decision for the nation. even at the end of 40 years any one of these foundations can turn its assets over to an operating foundation or charitable foundation and thus pay tax. so money is involved. it is  a tax reform to right some inequity. it is just an issue that at the end of 40 years we are going to decapitate any private foundation without any regard to its performance standard. therefore. it is a sociological decision. there is method for evaluating the standards by which the foundations would have performed. there is determination that some foundation should  exist for even 40 years while others should exist for far longer. therefore. this would just be a sudden death proposition. matter how desirable the operations of the foundation were that it had carried on. therefore. i think we would be carrying out. in this tax reform bill. a major change in american society. this is why the foundations and the recipients of the foundations charity have been up in arms. perhaps someone can analyze for them that part of the bill is going to trouble him seriously in his lifetime. but they say it is a sentence of death or of disapproval by the senate of the united states of the whole concept of philanthropic giving. that is what alarms them so much. that is why i criticize it this morning. i regard this as the central. most critical amendment with regard to the foundation that perhaps has faced us in the time we have served
ial commission in order to determine what ought to be our general policy and our tax policy with respect to those areas of the tax reform bill which deal with foundations and charitable contributions. we have dealt with two very important aspects of foundation activity. one relates to the life of the foundation. which we have just decided. and the other relates to voter registration drives. which we decided yesterday. what remains for decision  is the whole question of the audit fee tax. which my amendment continues. but explains that it is based upon the actual cost of the audit activity which it is intended to finance. hence. if we express the intention that private foundations pay an audit fee. and obviously it does  cost that much to administer that intention. congress should be able to reduce the feealthough my amendment does  introduce automaticity into it but merely provides for a regular review and report by the secretary of the treasury regarding the cost of the audit and the amount of revenue being generated by the audit fee.
the commission would go into every subject relating to tax exemptions and tax deductions including this question and the entire philanthropy question. the commission would go into the whole fundamental question of whether foundations. philanthropic giving and other taxexempt organizations. should be exempt from the taxes and. if so. to what extent. the commission therefore would cover the whole field. my amendment does  seek to delete from the bill the provisions with respect to abuses. as it were. and that is one of the things alleged to be an abuse. therefore. my amendment does  try to take it out of this bill. it leaves the senate bill as it is. if other senators wish to amend it. they may. just as two members have amended other provisions regarding charitable foundations. but i do  actually excise the business holdings limitations from the senate bill. in other words. a subject need  be excised from the senate bill in order to have it considered by this high level. or blue ribbon. presidential commission. it can be left in the bill and considered. also.
i am grateful to the senator. some of the major questions which would be considered. aside from the specifics. such as those raised by the senator regarding the amount of stockownership or corporate control which could be exercised by the foundation. among other things. would be to analyze all tax exempt activities to determine whether tax liability is being inequitably avoided. for example. what activities should be carried on by foundations and other taxexempt organizations in order to earn or qualify for tax exemptions. what are the desirable limits for legislative and political activity for taxexempt organizations. is it desirable to permit taxes of individuals to be reduced by making gifts to organizations which engage in philanthropy. whether private or otherwise. should taxexempt organizations be taxed on unrelated business income. what is the total cost to the government to provide comparable services compared to the cost of providing these services through a series of tax concessions and what are the relative benefits to society. these are all profound questions. the whole issue and its desirability has been raised by this endeavor to regulate. so my amendment goes to these fundamental propositions as well as to foundations and their justification. it deals with situations beyond contributions to the foundations by individuals. asking that that whole question be examined with the greatest care before we arrive at the point where we take away some rights of contribution. or which will inhibit contributions very materially. and which have been carried on by givers as one of the lest activities of our nation. it seems to meand the senator from connecticut. who is a member of the committee. has stated it very eloquently and admirablythat at the very least we should have a deliberate understanding on the highest level. the commission i have in mind would have two members from the senate. two members from the house of representatives. and 21 members from outside the government appointed by the president without regard the first vote carries. i will withdraw the to political party affiliation. and with others. because i think that would be regard to the highest talent available in fair and intelligent. because we then the nation for such a job. there is would have a commission which would reason why we can have the best be seized of the whole field. and whatever available brains on this subject. we will is taken out of the bill that a member have some really authoritative concepts feels doubtful about would be considas to whether we are doing the right ered and resolved by the commission so thing in the entire taxexempt field as that it will  go down the drain. well as whether there is any justification i think that is a helpful proposition. for exemptions for philanthropic con- that there will be a basket. as it were. so tributions. that anything dropped out of the bill that in closing. i would like to emphasize we are doubtful about will be considered from the chart which i have submitted by the commission. including the 40year to the senate that even though there are limitation. there is reason why it items which i do  ask by my amend- should  consider the question of the ment to be deleted they are etheless life of any foundation and how long it items which the commission will be should persist or why there should  seized to study and to give us a judg- be a permanent body which would conment of what we should do about those tinually review taxexempt status which issues. which have been brought so could move to terminate such status. sharply into question today. my amend- in common law. as we lawyers ment deletes those inhibitions on gtv- kand most senators here are ing. it does  deal with all questions of lawyersthe rule against perpetuities alleged excesses. but leaves them in the for charitable trusts is. "lives in bebill as they are. ing. plus 21 years." there is limitai hope this commission would be tion on lawyers--the rule against perseized of the basic sociological questions petuities for charitable trusts that they our country faces with respect to this may exist forever. there may be someparticular matter. thing to the argument that foundations . i wish to ask how many should  be in being forever. i said that senators are required to request the yeas i do  favor the 40year proposition beand nays. cause it is arbitrary. there is basis
. i say to my own chairman. first. of course. as i have already stated. there is preclusion. second. i can think of anything that would better stimulate the commission to more activity than the fact that it would have a senate subcommittee to test its ideas on. the commission will be deeply concerned with the basic social questions of tax exemptions. as i said earlier. i do  k whether the senator from arkansas was here at the time.
one thing that seems to trouble many people about this tax loophole is the question of privately owned companies. when the owner dies and has a large stock interest in a relatively privately owned company so that there may be great appreciation in it. how does the senator deal with that problem. there may  be a ready buyer. in many cases.
is there any consequence of the senators amendment that would bring pressure upon the heir so that he would have to sell because of the nature of taxes which would be due upon death. due to appreciation of the asset.
i think the senator was  following me exactly. i think i get the situation. i asked the senator whether there was anything implied in his amendment which would put pressure on the inheritor of the stock to sell it. i think the senator from delaware has very adequately answered that question. . would the senator from maryland be agreeable. either in his amendment or in the conferees. to seeing that some way is worked out to accommodate those who would be even further jeopardized by a forced sale because of the additional tax burden. i am  in favor of seeing this loophole continued and perhaps you could devise a system where an estate with this type of problem could have additional time in which to solve it.
. it is very important to crystallize the issue. because we are all trying to get to the point. is  a major part of the argument of the senator from delaware that the in-. heritance tax rates partially reflect that the tax on the capital gains may be avoided. and the senator from maryland argues that they do . that the inheritance tax rates do  discount that capital gains may be avoided and therefore the capital gain should be paid in addition. is  that the essence of the issue.
. i have listened to this debate with great interest because although i am much in favor of encouraging hoable charitable giving. i had  intended to challenge the decision to repeal the unlimited charitable deduction. i think the senator from minnesota makes a point that i am fully sympathetic to. the point endemic in the argument of the senator from louisiana is that people cried out against the 155 taxpayers who may have avoided taxes through charitable contributions but  against the philanthropists themselves or philanthropy. philanthropists still are one of the most recognized and highly respected groups in this country. it should also be ed that the charitable deduction is only one of several means by which tax liability may be reduced. in fact. i understand that only about onethird of those taxpayers utilized the unlimited deduction. the great bulk of those taxpayers used other means. such as the oil depletion allowance and other preferences which we are eliminating from the bill. to escape taxation. the senator from minnesota is correct in pointing out that the balance of the public interest is to encourage rich people  to sit on the money. or to pay it in taxes. but to use it in the ways that have been described and which benefit society. we are making foundations pay out the funds contributed in an adequate way. it is a close question but in my judgment it should be answered in the manner which preserves pluralism and individual initiative in our society. i think the senator from louisiana makes a strong point when he says we should  allow the rich person. as contrasted with one of more modest means. to choose who will receive his tax money. i think. however. we should  ige the fact that the charitable deduction is  50 percent. anyone can use the 50percent advantage according to the senator from louisiana. the senator does  explain why it is proper in the case of 50 percent and incorrect here.
. it feels a little lonely to take the floor at this hour and under these copditions. especially when one has the affection for the senator from new hampshire that i have. and with much reason. i have been through many legislative struggles. in which he has been a prince. the manager of the tax bill on the floor. for the majority. says nice things about the amendment and would take it if we let him-
. this very information i asked for was included in the 1968 annual report of the secretary of the treasury. what it deals with is the amount which the various tax preferences. and so forth. really cost us. this is a very important question which has arisen time and time again in the debate. i would like to ask the manager of the bill a question. it is my understanding that the secretary is  committed to include the same information in all future reports. if that is the understanding of the manager of the bill as well. there is need for pursuing amendment  309.
i do  believe that it works that way. because. as i understand the way the departments operate. they have already spent money on the continuing resolution. they will then allocate what they have received in the way of appropriation. or the budget bureau will do it for them. and it may result in scaling down their allocation if the appropriation for this fiscal year is less than for the previous fiscal year. for the period which the senator has in mind. the supplemental appropriation bill really does  help too much in that kind of situation. where you have ongoing administration. because they have to condition their activities. which have a certain amount of leadtime. according to the very low appropriation which is provided for in this bill. it is  an automatic situation. such as in the case of interest on debt or veterans benefits. where a supplemental can really mean something. it is also unlike situations which are prospective in their application. such as the neighborhood youth corps summer program where we do  get action until july but the money can still be used. the ecoic opportunity act appropriation is an ongoing thing which requires balance through the year. and it does  do them any good unless they have some stabilizing concept of what they are budgeting and what they are doing. therefore. i would appreciate it if the senator would tell us precisely what the substantive basis was for the appropriation committees cuts. unless the only substantive basis was the committees idea that half the year has expired. with all due respect. i do  think that represents any basis for cuts of this kind.
i hope the senator will forgive me. but i think he ks that this is my principal committee and i am heavily involved in all of its activities. including the manpower provision to which the senator has just referred. we will check out the neighborhood youth corps summer program in order to see whether any effort to increase that allocation is justified and i will report to the senate and to the chairman. but i did want to ask the senator this one question which puzzles me. the senator speaks of the jobs program. but the senator does  say exactly what the committee gave that program.
so that the senator can understand better the point that i raise on page 6 of the report. it reads as follows: the amount requested for 1970 was an increase of $192.050.000 for the jobs program and $44.200.000 for the concentrated employment program. these are both relatively new programs funded at a low level at the beginning of fiscal year 1969 ...
173 pages of justification were submitted to the appropriations committee. the budget submission. which is before me. is dated ember 1969. it details with the greatest itemization. for example. i look  at page 83 of the summary. which shows exactly what was done in 1969 in these very thingsheadstart. follow through. special impact. health services. addiction. mental health. family planning. emergency food. the increases and the exact basis therefor are given. the budget bureau went along with them. i have served on the appropriations committee. too. i appreciate the fact that the members of the committee are unbelievably overwhelmed. but where information has been submitted. if it has  been consulted or digested or dealt with by the committee. i do  think the agency can be taxed. i kbecause we all have experienced itwhat happens when you go for a 4month program. which is what is being done. there must be cancellations . because people can tool in and tool out that quickly. and then the fat is in the fire in city after city. the problem is  so much that the committee does  have the material but that it has  had an opportunity to digest it.
i say to the senator in conclusion. . that as a matter of common decency. the ceiling for the senate negotiators should at least be the budget figure. which is the figure authorized by the senate committee and. as the senator from wisconsin has very eloquently pointed out. is $40 million less than what the senate appropriated in money the last time out. with a program that is infinitely more expensive. as we k. to administer.
. we are indeed fortunate that this distinguished and balanced ecoist. whom i have kn for more than two decades. will soon move into the crucial position which has been so importantly filled with distinction by william mcchesney martin since the early 1950s. dr. burns will be picking up the reins at the fed at a time when there is widespread controversy over the role being played by the fed. at immediate issue is the unusually tight monetary policy that the fed has maintained since late spring which has perhaps moved this ecoy to the brink of serious recession. the time is upon us for a new creative monetary policy which will move our ecoy back from this brink while at the same time continuing to curb the price inflation which has seriously distorted our ecoy since the peak of the vietnam buildup. dr. burns is eminently qualified to walk this dangerous tightrope. his sound and mature judgment. his modern ecoic ideas. and his widespread experience at the highest levels of our government. are the qualities this nation and world will need in the crucial months and years ahead. dr. burns will need and deserve our support in the period ahead.
i would  quite go that far. for this reason: it constitutes a conflict between the attorney general and the comptroller general. i would  say congress. because congress is going to have a chance to speak on this right . the comptroller general is an arm of congress. but this bill submits the issue to congress. section 904 seizes us of the question. it is we .  the comptroller general. who are going to pit ourselves against the attorney general. that is a very important point. we are going to decide today. in the senate. and in the other body. on the conference report. if this carries through conference. that we are going to take on this issue and we will have decided. the men who drew section 904 were fools. because giving the comptroller general this absolute authority is the way congress can decide the issue. if the president signs this bill. then the comptroller general becomes our agent.  generally in fiscal matters. but he becomes our agent to kill the philadelphia plan or to kill anything else he does  likewe give him that powerwhen he holds that it is in contravention to a federal statute. matter what the attorney general holds and. i think. matter what the courts hold. we give him that power. so you have congress. you do  have just the attorney general. it is congress. we are  seized of it. and we are going to act. yea or nay. in a relatively short time.
 decides. because he sees the strength of the opposition in the senate. to veto the bill. i have every confidence that we will get a social security increaseprobably with much sounder financingthat the surcharge will be continued as we all k it must. that the investment tax credit will be repealed. and that the substantive elements of tax reform arrived at by the conferees will. because of public demand. become law. therefore. i take this course of action in the hope that we would be saving the best and rejecting the worst. because one can have the choice of dividing the issue. we must vote yea or nay. it is interesting to me that the senator from delaware referred to the fact that in 1967. he and iwe are usually at different ends of the ideological spectrumjoined in urging the administration that if it were going to make war. it should tax as a government does when there is a war. the lesson is clear. we can have it both ways. yet. that is the way. even after all the bittter experience of inflationthat we are proposing to proceed. again. though i feel that the conferees have done a fine job within the delineation of the principles upon which they have operated. i regret very much that i can support this conference report.
when was the last construction under this. and has it been completed. in other words. are we dealing with a situation of lack of completion. according to the facts. $11.4 million of an appropriation of $32.4 million remains uligated at the beginning of fiscal 1970. the question is. is it available for obligation. or will it terminate as of the end of the fiscal year.
i k. all i am saying is that the allocated part of that payment in lieu of taxes attributable to education. per child. is an average of a few cents over $11 a child. that 10 percent covers lots of other thingspolice. fire. streets. traffic. garbage. and everything else.
i take one additional minute. it seems to me that senator eagleton. the author of the amendment. has certainly demonstrated his good faith by accepting the proposition of a separate line item in the budget with respect to the children in public housing. if the appropriations committee chooses  to give it any money. or to give it less money. or to use aher formula. it is perfectly free to do it. and we must accommodate ourselves to that. but to cut it outand that is the purpose of this amendment. to eliminate itit seems to me. . i hope the amendment will be defeated.
. for the information of the senate. i understand the situation is as follows: this is a 4year program for the construction of educational research facilities. an entirely desirable program with an authorization of $100 million. of that sum $32.4 million has been appropriated. and about $20 million of that $32.4 million has been spent. three centers have been constructed. they were accounted for this morning. i believe the unspent amount is impounded by the bureau of the budget which does  wish to spend the money. the only import of the amendment would be to extend the authorization for whatever remains in it. it would be. in round figures. $68 million. the department of health. education. and welfare considers this a desirable program. it seems to me. therefore. that the amendment should be accepted in view of the fact it is only an extension and  a new program that the extension is desirable. that the bureau of the budget is well seized of the existing appropriations and is controlling the flow of those funds. and that the committee on appropriations will have control of additional appropriations if any are sought. i see objection to the amendment. i state these facts for the benefit of the senate. i have consulted with the ranking miity member on the subcommittee on education who feels the same way.
. i will  in any way controvert my beloved colleague. the senior senator from vermont. because he is right. however. the statement is  germane to the argument. the question is what is the cost of living for those families. of the 30 percent. 25 percent are engaged in processing various types of agricultural products and live in towns with populations of from 2.500 to 50.000. their cost of living certified by me. but certified by the bureau of labor statisticsis at the very minimum in the area of $5.000 for a family of four. and the rural people. the people who. because of cows. pigs. and vegetables. may have a lower cost of living because they get the benefit of the farm. is a very small percentage of the population of the united states.
. i do  think the senator should move so quickly past his most statesmanlike and constructive action which he has developed with the new chairman of the federal reserve board in respect to title v of this bill. the senator has made very clear. and his whole work has made very clear the critical impact of high interest rates on the housing supply of this country withstanding our protestations in that regard with respect to those rates and some of the whiplash resulting from the struggle .from inflation. i deeply sympathize with the need and i want to do something about it. the senator has developed an ingenious idea with regard to the utilization of the federal reserve board. i k it was an idea developed out of the exigencies of the situation rather than out of choice. however. many. including our leading bankers. saw in it grave dangers to the concept of the federal reserve system. which has been sustained with such remarkable fidelity during all these years. this was quite a collision between the very ingenious utilization of the uniquekind of authority the federal reserve system has. and a very legitimate and deep disquiet by some of the most responsible people we have in this country. including the chairman of the federal reserve board. as to opening the door to other uses of the federal reserve system .which adversely might affect the institution. i think the solution of the problem which has been worked out should be marked as a signal service to the future stability of our ecoic system and the future utilization of the federal reserve board as the remarkable instrument and the flexible instrument for both expansion and contraction which it representsthe instrument which got us away from the slavery of gold domestically and utilized the power of production and credit in order to fuel our fantastically rich ecoy. the senator from wisconsin has performed an historic service. as has arthur burns and everyone else who had anything to do with the solution. it was important to find a way to serve the burning. urgent needs in the housing field. at the same time  running the riskthe senator thought it was  there. but others whom he respects thought it wasof compromising the unusually useful instrument of the financial policy of the united states. i think it should be commented on. and ed. that the executive branch made its contribution but. essentially. it was a result of the efforts of the senator from wisconsin and the new chairman of the federal reserve board. arthur burns. joined by secretary romney and his associates. i congratulate them. i think they have rendered a signal service to the country in working this matter out.
. the sole purpose of the amendment is to conform the situation in section 236 mortgages to the present situation in section 221(d) (3) mortgages which allow a higher cost limit to be utilized in the acquisition of mortgages when tax abatement by the municipality is involved. this is critically important to my state. especially to the city of new york. and will allow 9.000 more units to be constructed under section 236. i hope very much that the amendment will be agreed to.
. i introduce for appropriate reference the improvement of education programs act. the first title of this bill consolidates into one title a number of existing higher education programs which have been previously authorized by the congress but  funded. these programs are interinstitutional networks for kledgetitle viii of the higher education act. education for the public servicetitle ix of the higher education act. clinical experience for students of lawtitle xi of the higher education act. and international affairs and foreign language educationthe international education act and title vi of the national defense education act. by consolidating these provisions. new life can tbe breathed into them so that they might realize the promise envisioned when first enacted by the congress. an authorization of $86.5 million for fiscal year 1972 is provided. which is the sum of the authorizations which were provided for the component programs. thus consolidation does  diminish the intent of the legislation. the second title of the bill modifies the administrations proposal for a national institute of education by adding "ination" to the research functions of the institute. this is accomplished by providing that the institute will administer the 15percent setaside recently enacted for title iii of the elementary and secondary education actination for elementary and secondary schoolsand a new inative program for higher education identical with that i proposed in my bill. s. 3369. the higher education project development act of 1970. introduced on february 3. by combining the research and ination functions under the institute. we will be increasing the effectiveness of each function. for they are clearly interrelated. the title iii. esea. program has proven its effectiveness since its enactment in 1965. the proposed higher education inative program has similar goals and is long overdue. it would provide colleges and universities with an opportunity for ination and to improve their management and academic procedures. the house of representatives has asked $137.393.000 for title iii. esea. for fiscal year 1971. 15 percent of this amount would be available to the institute for elementary and secondary education ination with the other 85 percent utilized under state supervision for that same purpose. there is authorized for fiscal year 1972 $30 million for higher education ination. all through the institute. for its research functions. the institute is provided the same open authorization as stipulated in the administration bill. of which i am a cosponsor. as originally introduced. as a matter of practice. the congress in considering such a measure usually provides for a specific authorization amount.
. in the very near future. congress will have before it the administrations proposals for restructuring the aid program in response to my amendment to the foreign assistance act of 1968. the key foundation block of the administrations forthcoming proposalswhich will soon be sent to the congress following their march 31. 1970. due date--is the distinguished report prepared by the task force on international development headed by rudolph a. peterson. this task force report states: the task force believes that more reliance on international organizations should be built into all u.s. policies relating to international developmentwhether they concern development assistance. debt rescheduling. tying. trade. investment or population. this is basic to the new approach to foreign assistance we recommend. a predominantly bilateral u.s. program is longer politically tenable in our relations with many developing countries.  is it advisable in view of what other countries are doing in international development. this approach is highly responsive to the demands for change in the aid program voiced in many quarters of congress in recent years. as we move toward increased reliance on international organizationstoward a greater multilateralization of development assistancethe interamerican development bank must be evaluated and considered as an important element in such a policy.
. we have been told since january that excess demand in our ecoy has been eliminated. and we have recently learned that businesses have substantially cut back on their earlier estimates for capital spending. these developments suggest that inflationary pressures are being substantially deflated. nevertheless. productivity has been declining since the last quarter of 1968. and falling productivity inevitably raises the unit costand the priceof manufactured goods. what we have. therefore. is a mixture of conditions. some laying the ground for rolling back inflation and others pointing toward further price increases. on the productivity side. i believe we must take steps to restore an effective investment incentive for business. failure to raise productivity by such a step as this will inevitably force business to resort to aher wellkn means of raising productivity: laying off employees. this fact indicates also that action on the pending manpower bill should be one of our high priority tasks as summer approaches. on the price sideand here is where the jec resolution comes ini believe the administration must adopt a stronger stance on wages and prices. the resolution describes one course of action which will mobilize public opinion in the fight against inflation. to use undersecretary walkers words. the resolution would push. or promote the educational process in understanding why prices do what they do. americans. who are far more sophisticated  than they were even in 1946 when the jec was established. demand and can absorb the kind of information that this resolution attempts to give them. i am aware that my democratic colleagues in the congress and in the joint ecoic committee are pressing for stronger action on the wageprice front. wageprice controls are talked about. as well as a wageprice freeze. we may have to come to them but the feasibility of a course of action at this time suggests the greater likelihood of immediate action along the lines of the resolution at hand. should current efforts to reduce inflation prove fruitlessand i include in those efforts a comprehensive program to improve business productivitywe may well have to enact stricter controls. i ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be printed in the record.
. it remains unclear at this moment as to the number of jobs that might be funded under the $15 million portion of the committee recommendation. accordingly. i submit today an additional amendment to increase the supplemental appropriation from $50 million to $100 million. which amendment i shall introduce in the event that information is provided indicating that $15 million designated for recreational programs will also provide a sufficient number of job opportunities. in the event that it appears that a sufficient number of jobs will  be provided out of the recreational funds. then i intend to introduce amendment  693. which would increase the amount of the supplemental for summer jobs from $50 million to $115 million. i submit also a ice of motion to suspend paragraph 1 of rule xvi as to the amendment which i have submitted today: cxvi---1240--part 15
. so that there may be question about it. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the- record a letter from the national alliance of businessmen dated today. in which they. make this statement: as of june 19. 1970. nabs metro offices had received firm offers from private employers for approximately 100.000 summer jobs for disadvantaged youth.
 of course . it would be used in support of recreation programs. thus giving additional job slots for the program for youth which would be employed in the recreation program. absolutely correct. . the second point is that the length of time for individual jobs would be cut to 812 weeks rather than 10 weeks. and that the $85 million could be profitably and effectively used for that purpose.
. first let me make clear that in saying what i do about the outlook of the other body in connection with this bill i am  at all critical of the tremendous amount of things and work which the rural areas of our country need. what i had in mind was a certain failure to realize the emous population growth of the cities. the vast problems they have. and the need for a constructive approach. with many. many things needed in the rural areas i was indulging more in parochial thinking rather than seeking to reduce one and increase the other. on the question of the shortage of summer jobs i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record a newspaper article which was published in the new york times of yesterday entitled "shortage of summer jobs found severest in years."
. and particularly the department of agriculture for its continued efforts and progress in eliminating hunger. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record todays press release from the san clemente white house. anncing the $217 million additional budget request.
i have heard with great interest the senator discuss the question of the construction grants for waste treatment works. the senator has made some point of the fact that the proviso extends for 6 months the time when funds appropriated for fiscal 1970 need  be reallocated. the senator. i think. has made clear the point of view of the states which. for many reasons. were  ready to use their share of the allotment. however. i do  believe the senator has looked at the other side of the coin. as i analyze the situation. there are many statesit looks to me from a quick appraisal to be 5050which have used the greater part of their allotments. and which have projects like my own state of new york. that amount to twice the present allotment. . withstanding that this is an ongoing program. they are being asked to stand by and let the laggards catch up. if it were a oneshot operation. i could understand that. but here we are appropriating aher billion dollars for the program. yet. withstanding that. we are also seeking to carry over funds which will  be reallocated for an additional 6 months because certain states were laggard in coming into the new program. this will prejudice many states like mine which have been on the ball and have done the job. my state has authorized $1 billion in state bonds for this purpose. so that we are way ahead of the parade. as this is hing but straight legislation on an appropriation bill. it seems to me that certain states. on a 5050 break. are being caught both ways. instead of $1.25 billion. which is the authorization. the committee is going along with the house on the $1 billion. my colleague . with me as cosponsor. was proposing to move to increase that.  the manager of the bill would like us to step aside and  do that. my colleague may  be able to be here today. although perhaps he will still arrive. and  delay the bill until monday. so that we get caught there. the next point is the 20 percent set aside under the bill in the first proviso. passed by the other body. as available for reimbursement to the states. and so forth. based upon the reallocation provision in the law. a good case could be made. 30 percent. based on the amount of reimbursement money that could be used.
. i do  think i need to protest to the senator from louisiana my appreciation of the emous burdens which he bears. the magnificent way in which he bears them and the general attitude of great cooperation which he has always manifested toward all of us. including my state. like the senator from wisconsin. i take very seriously a plea from him. for reasons which i think are very profound on this part. to try to end consideration of this bill. therefore. i would like to lay a suggestion before him with regard to the proviso. which is legislation. i could make a point of order against it. that would have to be passed on probably by a majority vote. undoubtedly because of our situation and the need to discuss it. it might make the bill go over until monday. which the senator does  want to do. i would like to ask the senator this question. the senator ks that i am very realistic. i am concerned that this proviso  takes us to the end of aher fiscal year. there is real incentive created. because we get into the end of aher fiscal year with this proviso. it sort of leads to aher appropriation. and we do  get a crispness and finality about the situation. would the senator take kindly the suggestion that we shorten the period and put the burr under all states to move. for example. suppose instead of june 30. it were made march 31. then it would end at least before the end of the fiscal year. there would be an incentive for those states to get on their horses and do something instead of saying. "we will wait until the end of the fiscal year and get under aher resolution."
i point out to my friend. the senator from louisiana. that i am  trying to seek an advantage. we are trying to be fair to the states which are running their affairs in shipshape fashion as all states should have done. however. we are  rewarding them. but are penalizing them because the very same acceleration which would bring about the use of this money. which is being carried over for 6 months. will bring those states into greater use of the $800 million. the extended period of time worsens the situation in both respects. i really came to the floor prepared to raise this question and bring it to issue king that it can be voted on. i felt that we are always among the states which meet the deadline. those states are always penalized because the laggards do  get on their horses and move. i must say that i am very deeply moved by the fact that this concerns louisiana. i do  in any way want to embarrass or complicate the situation of the senator from louisiana. that is why instead of seeking to press the matter to a conclusion. since i k the senator wants the bill. i suggested some modest curtailment of the time. i had the idea of  making it contemporaneous with the end of the fiscal year which would encourage the laggards to move.
. one thing i would like to ask the senator. it is one thing to do this for the first time. and it does have certain elements of fairness in it. this is the first time out. but equally important to me. and to the amendment. and shortening this time and getting it out of the fiscal phase. is the assurance of the chairman that this is  a precedent. that this is a oneshot matter. because states. perhaps. were  ready. people were slow. and so forth. however. we are  going to have this become a turnstile operation because states are laggard in the use of this money.
 if we are ever going to arrest the trend in this nation toward welfare dependency and to alleviate the despair of many of the poor. we must allocate even more funds for these essential antipovertyprograms. we are  merely scratching the surface of need. even with the increases sought by the administration for this fiscal year. we will reach less than 31 percent of all poor children ages 36 who need early childhood education. less than 10 percent of persons who could benefit from manpower programs. only 1.7 percent of the hardcore drug addicts among the poor. only 8.9 percent of those who could benefit from family planning services. only 7 percent of the poor who need legal services. and only 7.3 percent of the .migrant and seasonal. farmworkers. i ask unanimous consent that there be included. in the. record at this point. a table prepared at my request by the office of ecoic opportunity. indicating target population to be. reached and the the universe of need for selected proverty estimated and proposed budgetary programs. together with estimates of the amounts for fiscal years 1970 and 1971.
. we can afford to let lapse existing efforts which have proven so successful. they should be expanded. instead. much more than $20.500.000 indicated for community development programs will be needed in fiscal year 1971 to refund existing programs and to fund new programs that may be established as the result of seven planning grants funded in fiscal year 1970. moreover. of the 15 largest cities in the nationcontaining many pockets of povertyonly seven have received assistance under the special impact program operated by the office of ecoic opportunity. there is ample evidence that a number of communitybased groups would qualify for assistance in these major cities were funds available. in fact during fiscal year 1970. when more funds were available. more than 170 applications. totaling $40.000.000 went unfunded.
. for fiscal year 1971 the number of disadvantaged who could benefit from manpower programs has been projected at more than 11.000.000 or 10 the number who will benefit under these funds. in this connection. i wish to emphasize a particular program which has been of special concern to methe neighborhood youth corp summer program. which provides work and training opportunities to disadvantaged youth 14 to 21 years of age during the summer months. the general amounts which i have cited do  reflect the supplemental appropriation approved in june of this year. and which many of the members of the appropriations committee supported. under that supplemental approximately $35.000.000 of a total supplemental of $50.000.000 was made available for the neighborhood youth corp summer job program. the administration budget request for fiscal year 1971 for this program requests $1.400.000 less than the amounts appropriated for fiscal year 1970. under the regular appropriations bill. accordingly. taking into account the supplemental fundingthis program is  projected at a level some $36.400.000 less than provided last summer. on the basis of this past summers cost. this should mean that approximately 82.000 fewer youths will be able to participate next summer than last. this would be especially unfortunate in light of the fact that even with the supplemental. the number of fulltime slots provided last summer were some 145.173 less than the cities had indicated could be effectively used. i ask unanimous consent that the record inelude a letter dated may 7. 1970. from the u.s. conference of mayors documenting that need.
i think the senator is confusing the remedy with the debt. the debt persists. we have contracted to pay up to 25 percent of the expenses of this organization. there are different remedies in different organizations in the united nations. the limit is to cut off the vote. for reasons our president thought proper he did  see fit to invoke that penalty against france and the soviet union. even though the courts decided against them. we had more at stake than was involved in that situation. but the point is we are affirming that point and we are keeping that point and this is a strong position for us to be in and it is  worth doing what is implied by the senator and jeopardizing that position on our part in terms of the u.n.. by taking this position in connection with the ilo. but we are doing it with our eyes open. of course. it is the old question that one faces as a lawyer: are you going to stand by the contract and sue for the debt. or repudiate the contract. in this case i think we are  wise to repudiate the contract.
i do  have those figures in front of me. last years budget of the ilo was $22 million. of which we paid $5.6 million. which is 25 percent. there must be $1 million or $2 million here for other matters but i will say to the senator that based on my kledge of this situation. this is something we agreed to pay.
. in the report appears the statement: the committee wishes to point out that the following language. contained in the house bill and recommended by the committee. is  authorized * * * and then goes on to set out the particular section we are amending. this matter has been covered by a budget estimate of $10 million. therefore. as i understand it. the ruling is that this is. in effect. an authorized amount and that amount will apply both to the $5 million and the $6 million. which is well within the budget estimate. will the chair tell me whether i am correct.
. i shall support the amendment. without necessarilyand all of us are in the same positionking what will finally come out of conference. it would undoubtedly be less than the $5.2 billion  contemplated when it comes out of conference. if it is adopted. my reason for supporting this amendment is that we must readjust our national priorities if we are  to sacrifice domestic tranquillity to a foreign war. the people had a chance to vote for guns or butter on a tax reform bill. and they decided  to pay the bill for both. we face  a deficit which may run as high as $10 billion. we should  provide such disproportionately large sums for the defense budget. it seems to me we are faced with choice except to readjust our priorities on a broad scale. which this amendment requires. because we simply must devote more money to cities. schools. health. ecology. and many other priorities needed at this time. i shall support the amendment.
. i submit an amendment to h.r. 18515. the laborhew appropriations bill for fiscal year 1971. to increase from $744.494.000 to $780.894.000 the appropriations for manpower development and training activities under the manpower development and training act of 1962. an increase of $36.400.000. the increase is necessary to maintain the neighborhood youth. corps summer jobs program at the same funding .level for next summer as it is this summer. the program. conducted by the department of labor. provides work and training opportunities for disadvantaged 14- to 21yearolds during the summer months.
. apparently the difficulty has been that for reasons which are integral to the particular program. hardpressed communities are shut out either because there is an expiration of time within which the appropriated moneys can be expended or because of fiscal year authorizations for which there is appropriation in time. senator goodell detailed a number of individual cases in which major programs for villages and towns have been shut out solely for that technical reason. i have shown the amendment to the senator from louisiana and to the senator from georgia who is very deeply interested in this particular matter. the senator from georgia was kind egh to say that it is a good amendment.
good. i think that is an important point. the senator also contemplates a sense of selectivity. it may be that older people who receive certain training. oven if you train them. could  do anything except public service jobs and. therefore. it is an idle gesture to have them find employment when there is e. but many of them will be employed who are  older people. the program will cover young people or middleaged people who could make aher career and the thrust and purpose here is that the secretary will be selective. it is  just a block of jobs he hands out. but he must be selective in pursuing the policy within the objective of getting people into jobs.
of course . the third point on which i would like to ask the senator a question in respect to this matter is as follows: the secretary will have emous discretion because we anticipate 4 million public service jobs that can be filled with a necessary kind of employee. and we are providing 250.000. would the senator feel that in the administration of the law we would expect a secretary to seek the maximum number of opportunities which would be of a productive character so a person could go through it so as to ultimately get in a position where he is on his own. whether public or private. in other words. should  the policy of the law be to use this title as much for that purpose as possible. he could  do it universally. but with such a wide choice of 250.000 jobs and a 4 million market. he would prefer one over the other.
the reason they can formally support. although they actually support it. is that they have  had a chance yet to submit it to the budget bureau. they give their views. which i am at liberty to state. they certainly have opposition to it. and see sense in it.
i really do  see why. it might cost them less. because the aggregate amount of the interest rate which these agencies charge. plus costs and fees. is less than banks. that is why they are in business. the banks put into the interest rate the very same charges.
. if i may have the attention of the manager of the bill. during my absence today the senate sustained the amendment of the senator from montana respecting the salaries of the personnel employed by committees. that is fine. and i am all for it. but it does create a problem for us in the discrepancy between committee top pay and men of our individual staffs. we are entitled to the same grade of personnel as the committees are. and we will also face the competition of the committees for good men. i was going to offer an amendment to modify that situation. but i gather that the manager of the bill and the ranking miity member of the committee. in view of the controversy that took place on the salary phase. do  feel that is desirable. and i am  going to do it. but i would ask the senator this question: if it does appear that we have competition. we have the following situation if we simply raise the permissible salary without increasing the overall allowance of the states. especially the very big ones like mine. where we run a constant deficit. it may interest senators to kand this is  true only of methat in all of my congressional service. i have never taken a penny of my salary. indeed. i have run a deficit over and above my salary. attributable to having to pay the salary of a good number of people. this is an ecoic problem of inconsiderable magnitude. so we could raise the rates without increasing the allowances. on the other hand. it might be that the senate would see fit to raise the allowances. perhaps the next time it considers the legislative appropriation bill. the question i would like to ask the manager of the bill and the ranking miity member. since this is an inhouse problem. is whether or . inasmuch as they prefer that i do  seek to offer my amendmentand i shall  in deference to their wishesthey will consider this problem sympathetically either on an appropriation bill or as separate legislation if it turns out that there is unhappy competition for good people. for jobs. because of the disparity of $3.000 which has just  been created. i would like to say at once that it is  so much a question of the disparity. they are able people. we are remarkably well served considering the frequent frustrations and unbelievably hard work of the job. but there is a question of morale involved. i think our top people have a legitimate complaint in that they are just as good as any committee staff members. i am the ranking member of two committees. and i have contact with both committee staff members and my own staff people. and i affirm for myself what they say. this is the problem. and. as i have said. it is an inhouse problem. before we lock up this bill. i would like to get the views of my colleague.
the amendment is designed to provide additional funds for three central purposes: first. to provide for the headstart program at a level sufficient to provide preschool education to children consistent with commitments made in previous years. second. to provide for manpower training activities at the levels which the administration originally requested. in order to help alleviate the individual hardships imposed by the current ecoic situation. which hits especially hard the young. the disadvantaged and the black. third. to provide for the director of the office of ecoic opportunity sufficient funds to maintain past commitments in such essential antipoverty efforts as local initiative. food. health. legal services. ecoic development. and rural programs. and to provide the amount which the administration requested for research development and evaluation. the amendment would appropriate a total of $2.245.500.000 to the office of ecoic opportunity for programs conducted under the ecoic opportunity act of 1964. an increase of $181.600.000 over the $2.063.900.000 recommended by the senate committee on appropriations. the administration originally requested $2.080.200.000. the house of representatives cut that request by $34.000.000 to $2.046.200.000. the ecoic opportunity act amendments of 1969 authorized a basic authorization of $2.295.500.000. out of that basic authorization. $50 million has been appropriated for desegregation assistance. leaving $2.245.500.000 of the basic authorization unappropriated. of the $2.245.500.000 which the amendment would accordingly appropriate. $398.000.000 is earmarked for the headstart program. and $802.000.000 is earmarked for work and training opportunities. these earmarkings would result in the application of $59.000.000 of the aggregate increase of $181.600.000 to the headstart program and $41.900.000 to work and training activities. leaving $80.700.000 of the increase to be allocated among the other essential poverty programs. i ask unanimous consent that there be inserted at this point in the record a chart which details the effect of the quest. allocations at the housepassed there being objection. the tabulaamendment as compared with fiscal 1970 level and the senate committee on ap- tion was ordered to be printed in the obligations. the presidents budget re- propriations recommendation. record. as follows:
. i shall  indicate in detail why we believe these amounts to be necessary. capable of being put to effective use during the remainder of this fiscal year andin factshould  be regarded as "increases" at all. but as the minimum necessary to maintain previous commitments to these essential programs.
i think we can go ahead with the debate. i must tell the senate that i understand the problem. i think we could get together on the various aspects of the money. i realize that the question of administration is difficult. the fact is that as the amendment  stands. and as we will see about it in the course of debate. the first vote will come on the really basic proposition: shall we increase the amount and shall we at one and the same time. vest the administration in the same way it has been vested up to to wit. in the oeo. which in turn has delegated administration to other agencies. by agreement. to wit. the department of labor and the department of hew. a real issue is on the money side. which i will discuss in a minute. on the question of administration. the basic question is this: until the end of this fiscal year. june 30. 1971. we would be allowing the oeo to continue to coordinate the whole program. including the manpower training phases. of it and the education phases of it. although practically it will actually be carried out by agreement. with the oeo. by the other two government departments. there is question about the fact that. beginning july 1. 1971. approximately what this appropriation bill as it  stands. will probably happen. so that the issue is whether we shall continue the present practice until the end of this fiscal year. or shall we immediately go to what probably will be the new practice. it is a fact that the operations of the oeo under this particular legislation in the past 2 years. including this fiscal year. have been to emphasize a shift in its operations to ination. to the kind of projects which community action agencies are in the best position to handle. it has gradually been reforming itself in the expectation that if there is a renewal of the legislation. the renewal will be put into effect. if the new system were established. the government departments will be administering the headstart and manpower programs which we have been discussing. there is a strong case. we believe. on the legislative sideand it is significantthat the sponsors of this amendment are largely the members of the committee on labor and public welfare on both sides of the aisle. we feel that this still is  finally developed. that there is still an advantage to giving the oeo the top management of the whole enterprise. and giving it a voice in the decisions as to the extent to which the poor shall themselves be tied into these operations. the extent to which they shall be handled by community action agencies and other community groups. and the extent to which other agencies and municipalities concerned with poverty programs. shall be involved as opposed to completely leaving it to the government departments with their traditional patterns for dealing with money. there is still egh of a poverty stamp on the requirements for the utilization of the funds to make it inadvisable to shift . i think i speak for all the sponsors in saying that in our legislative activityand we are all membersthe senator from wisconsin is the chairman of the subcommittee. and i and others concerned. such as the senator from massachusetts . the senator from california -we are all members of the labor and public welfare committee and we are completely ready and desirous of putting some new system into effect as of the beginning of the next fiscal year. july 1. 1971. but this appropriation is for this fiscal year.  for the next fiscal year. for this fiscal year. we deeply believe that the authority for a transition period which we gave ourselves in the original legislation should be hoed in the appropriation as well. we would have hoped very much that the appropriations committee. would have been convinced of that and would have left to us the timing of the decisions. that is all we are really arguing about. what we have done in this amendment is to ask the senate to stay with us on the timing of the decision. that is the issue upon which the senate will vote as an inherent element of the first part of this amendment. the other issue upon which the senate is to vote-
. i hope that the senator. who is a very able senator is  going to tax me with the fact that i did my best to draft an amendment which would pose the issue in one vote. it is a fact that the amendments which ensue might go down and might present us with some kind of odd bill. but that has happened here before.
. that gives $43 million which can be allocated to the items above the figures we have set down for the items above it. in the legislative authorization we listed the figures according to what the administration budget or the senate appropriations showed. in most cases less the 15percent transfer.
in the first place. i agree with the senator. and i gave my reason for the funding of the authorization here being attributable to the fact that this bridge is built to meet the other side anyhow. but i would like to point out that even if we are doing this we still omit $684.200.000 which was authorized for fiscal 1971. the socalled addons. really. the full authorized amount is $2.879 billion. we are  raising that issue. we understand it is impractical and unrealistic. we are proceeding on the ceiling in the authorization on oeo. i think it is fair to say we are trying  to be unrealistic.
 did put the matter before the committee on foreign relations. and there the senator from idaho and i were among the overwhelming majority of the committee which reported the measure. reporting the convention only brings it to the floor of the senate. we still have a monumental struggle. i rise to pay tribute to the senator from wisconsin whose heart has been in this matter for so long and who was correct in hailing this as a gratifying development. i hope he will continue in his efforts until we celebrate when the senate ratifies this fundamental human debt we owe so many millions of people who died at the hands of the geidists. ably hitler.
. i think that the senator from connecticut has certainly stated a very hoable and accurate position. the reason why this does disturb the balance of the billand i am sorry to sound so hackneyed about it. but this is what it is all aboutis as follows: we have tried to avoid carving this agency out as a special one apart from government. one that would have super power over other agencies. we dealt with that with respect to the amendment of the senator from washington . this is very much the same type of proposal. the fact is that. with respect to other agencies. the office of management and budget is  similarly restricted in terms of time. this amendment would so restrict it with respect to this agency. and therefore. if we acted afmrmatively on this amendment. this agency would be carved out as a special case. i point out that the basic provision we are talking about is coordination of federal reporting services. which is the subject of section 139 of title 5 of the united states code. i ask unanimous consent that that section be printed in the record at this point.
. i gave the senate the arguments pro and con. and i would like to give my own judgment. i believe that the 5 percent can be justified. retroactive to january 1. first. on practical grounds. that. having stayed the unions strike. they should be given something. and. second. because there is question about the cost of living running away to that extent. and the fact that these unions and these workers have  had any increases for a long time. they have a very equitable case on it. i think the 8percent question is a very. very questionable item. and the majority of our committee thought they had to go to that extent. the senate may disagree with them. i think that can be justifiedand i say this in fairness to senator proutys amendment. which he offered in the committeeon the very elementary basis that something should be done and that it does have a direct relationship to the increase in the cost of living and that these workers really have  had the benefit of any increase.
as i say. i do  see any particular point in pressing this matter unless it were congenial to the committee. i see great equity in the fact that we may. be wasting some valuable time. in view of the fact that. i gather from the senator. the authorization will be passed shortly. may i ask the senator. if there is an authorization. as a result of the conference. would it be the intention of those who are on the judiciary committee to press for budget action and appropriations action in january. in the form of a supplemental appropriation.
. first i join with my colleagues in approving the raising of this issue by the senator from delaware and trying to get somewhere with it. i think that the senator from delaware has put us all in his debt for doing so. however. i do  believe this is the moment to press the matter. i think that there are senators who are brave egh. if they think the interest of the country deserves such action. to object. they probably will object. including myself. i say that because this is the kind of thing which one needs to take a few minutes or an hour to consider. i heard hing mentioned in the unanimousconsent request about amendments to an amendment. i heard hing mentioned in the unanimousconsent request about germaneness.
that is exactly right. and. for example. to add just one word. brimmer of the federal reserve gives us figures as to what it will cost the consumers of this country to put quotas on foods and textiles. one here has been able to test those figures either up. down. or sideways. except in the most cursory and onthesurface manner. because we simply have  had the time and opportunity to do it in depth.
. we have had unsatisfactory experience with the results of trying to control the executive in war actions by power of the purse. as a senator. i will vote for this conference report because to do otherwise would i believe really tax the american system. and tax it in a way which i can conceive of its being strained. when the men who are the conferees and are the heads of responsible committees. and those members who have the deepest concerns and who are in agreement with each other as to the true meaning and the true purpose we have in mind. i would therefore consider my affirmative vote to be a change of position which. in my judgment. would lock in our reliance upon these understandings established in colloquy because of any question about our colleagues here in the senate. i assure this to the senator from louisiana and the senator from mississippi. for i think any member of the senate would stake his life on their ho. but we do need them when there may be a temptation by officials outside this chamber to seek authority which we k does  exist but which someone may try to find. when one tries to do something. he will always try to find a lawyer to tell him how he can do it and  what can be done. i am going to vote for the conference report on the basis of the understandings and agreements we have put together in debate. it is a change of position for me and others. in placing reliance upon that basis. i can conceive and i hope it would never happen in our country that any executive or executive agent. cabinet officer. or others would seek to do other than the clear intention we express in this appropriation which is so big it "boggles" the imagination.
i would like to associate myself with those who urge a calendar year for the united states rather than a fiscal year. this is a longstanding reform which has been urged by many long before us. and is  perhaps approaching its time because of our dissatisfaction with the way in which we get tangled up in our own processes. i hope very much that can be worked out. with respect to the reference by the senator from vermont to what we tried to do about seniority in the republican conference. it is a fact that. with the senator from colorado
 nixon emphasized the need to let those on the community level participate more fully in the governmental process. the proposed act would implement that objective in the very important area of child development by providing a framework under which the essential decisions would be made at that level. where comprehensive services can be provided. where parents and other members of the family can participate fully in determining the direction as well as the conduct of programs. and where the redtape generated by multiple funding sources can be cut. third. those on the community level who are operating programs according to the way we envisage them. should have the benefit of technical assistance from state agencies in identifying goals and needs. effecting coordination between programs within the state. strengthening health. educational. child welfare. and other essential components of community programs and providing supportive research. development. and evaluation. in a number of instances. state governmentincluding my own state of new yorkhas taken meaningful initiatives in the field of child development and day care. the act will permit that early experience to be imparted to those on the local level where it can best be channeled to meet the particular needs of the community. fourth. the proper role of the federal government is in maintaining a strong oversight to insure that programs continue to focus on children of lowincome families. and that programmatic quality is advanced throughout the nation through research. demonstration. and evaluative activities. while decisionmakirig must be shifted to the state and community level. the federal responsibility for insuring that our previously established priorities are kept can be shifted. as i shall outline later. the federal government can serve aher special functionby becoming a model employer insofar as child development programs are concerned. in dealing with the children of its own employees. fifth. relating to the programs which are ongoing . we should  only maintain. but expand the role of community action. singlepurpose headstart agencies. and other communitybased and parentformed organizations. as well as educational and child welfare agencies. which have brought child development to the threshold of universal expansion. this is  a bill designed to eliminate existing programswhile it would repeal the present authority for hfeadstart. as i shall point out in detail. it is designed instead to make such programs more secure in a new framework where they can have the advantage of substantially additional sources of funding. finally. business. industry. labor. employee. and labormanagement organizations should be encouraged to contribute funds to community programs and provide facilities at or near a place of business in the context of total community plans. we must neither ige the contribution which the private sector can make  allow it to take over completely the sensitive matter of child care. which requires an interdisciplinary approach. to carry out these principles the proposed act consists of three titles: under title i. the secretary of health. education. and welfare is directed to fund child programs pursuant to community childcare plans developed by broadly representative councils at the community level. with technical assistance provided from a state child care council pursuant to a state childcare assistance plan. the following amounts are authorized for such purposes: $900.000.000 for fiscal year 1973. $1.800.000.000 for fiscal year 1974. and $2.800.000.000 for fiscal year 1975. in round figures. this represents an aggregate of about $5 billion. title ii authorizes additional amounts for federal activities such as research. demonstration. and evaluation. and for special programs for children of federal employees. under this title. the following amounts are authorized: $125.000.000 for fiscal year 1973. $175.000.000 for fiscal year 1974. and $175.000.000 for fiscal year 1975. making a total of $475 million. title 1ii contains general authorities with respect to the operation of the provisions of the act. but titles i and ii are the main components. with this general background. i shall  indicate the manner in which each of the objectives and principles is met in terms of specific provisions of the proposal which we submit today.
. i introduce. for appropriate reference. the consolidation of special higher education programs act. this bill consolidates into one title a number of existing higher education programs which have been previously authorized by the congress but  funded. these programs are interinstitutional networks for kledgetitle viii of the higher education act. education for the public servicetitle ix of the higher education act. clinical experience for students of lawtitle xi of the higher education act. and international affairs and foreign language educationthe international education act and title vi of the national defense education act. by consolidating these provisions. new life can be breathed into them so that they might realize the promise envisioned when first enacted by the congress. an authorization of $86.5 million for fiscal year 1972 is provided. which is the sum of the authorizations which were provided for the component programs. thus consolidation does  diminish the intent of the legislation. by mr. javits:
surely. in view of the possibility of a veto. which hangs over everyones head. i think it is important for the president to have assurance that whenever his revenuesharing plan phases in. this would be phased out. we world have to be satisfied with general revenue sharing as encompassing this bill. we would have to be sure that the two would phase together.
i refer the senator to the following statement on page 38 of the report. where the provisions of the bill are summarized: subsection (b) of section 5 authorizes the commissioner to make grants to. and contracts with. local educational agencies in which the number of miity group children in average daily membership in its schools for the fiscal year proceeding the year for which assistance is sought (1) is at least 15.000. or (2) constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total number of children in average daily membership at such schools.
. is the result of the work and personal efforts expended over a very considerable period of time of the chairman of the committee and of the senator from minnesota . indeed. my only role of any consequence in the matter was in the effort to work out a bill which could get us the money and. at the same time. do the job in view of the fact that the administration had sent up in its budget $1.5 billion. which we certainly wanted for this purpose. i worked with essentially the materials which were available from the committee staff. acting under the senator from rhode island and the ideas of the senator from minnesota . this was the stuff out of which i did my utmost to bring about agreement.
. i. too. have submitted testimony to the internal revenue service which is considering the question of depreciation allowances. with respect to this matter. i agree with the senator from ohio. i think that the implementation of revised depreciation schedules as proposed by the u.s. treasury is very much in the interest of the american worker and the nation. i ask unanimous consent that my testimony before the internal revenue service may be made a part of my remarks.
. let me repeat. we are  seeking in any implicit or indirect way to go after any particular tax preference or any particular loss of revenue under the special federal tax provisions but we feel the time has come to k what they amount to and also how they relate as an indirect expenditure to each particular function set up in the budget. we hope very much that we shall have early consideration of this matter. what we consider to be a highly desirable reform by the committee on government operations on which the senator from illis (i. percy) and i both serve. as well as by the senate. i ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill printed in the record.
. . it is mans propensity to select shortterm stopgap measures over sweeping reform proposals. in the case of our international monetary structure and in the light of the recent history of recurring monetary crises which have  contributed to the crises facing the structure of international trade. stopgap shortterm measures are longer adequate. the latest adjustments have bought us precious but little time to restructure the existing monetary system to meet the needs of the 1970s. these changes must take account of the changed circumstances that the government leaders could  have foreseen in the bretton woods conference of 1944. we must act  to revise and modernize the bretton woods agreements. the purpose of my concurrent resolution. joined in by senators miller and percy. and of my statement today is to get the united states thinking about this situation. and our congressional committees to hold hearings about this situation. as active participants and  just as interested lookerson. which is the impression we have given the world up to .
. the second point relates to the hopefulness of getting something out of the private enterprise system. without federal financing. as it were. summer jobs. our main hope there is the national alliance of businessmen. which. in a letter to me. dated april 14. 1971which i included at page 15106 in the record of may 14. 1971. said it hopes to provide 150.000 private sector jobs to ecoically disadvantaged youth. i wish to point out that last summer on a forecast of 180.000as compared with this years 150.000the performance fell short of that by about 20 percent. they had 143.000 jobs against a 180.000job target. if 20 percent is deducted from the 150.000 which they  estimateand it may be worse than that. in view of the higher rate of unemploymentthere is a need right there shown. in that one category. of 30.000 jobs in terms of expectation from the private sector. we have seen. from the demonstrations here in washington and other problems. that our country can be regarded as being in a highly pacific condition. there is a great deal of tension in the country. that tension could be sparked into flames in the cities. indeed. the kerner commission has warned us most strictly against the dangers to the cities from the unemployment situation in these months. in its report on the riots in newark and detroit. it pointed out that we have to make larger fiscal commitments to programs such as the neighborhood youth corps and related programs to meet the needs in the poverty areas for unemployed youth. thereby diminishing the effects of poverty and disorder. we must soberly recognize that when we get up to a rate of black youth unemployment in ghettos and slums of almost 50 percent. we are really looking for trouble if we do  make the most adequate provision of which we are capable. the argument is made that even if we give them the money. it can be used. i think that argument has been thoroughly exploded. we have given money to the cities as late as june. and sometimes as late as july. and the money has been used with remarkable effectiveness by the cities. this is a tribute to the cities and the mayors in those particular programs. what we are seeking is what the league of mayors has certified as an urgent need.
. while the senator from washington is here. i would like to put a matter before him. if i may have his attention. it will be ed that the committee report says. on page 33: this will provide $87.2 million for 187.200 new summer jobs and expand the total program from 8 to 9 weeks. i point out .to the senator from washington that that statement is inaccurate. it is an unwitting error. but it is inaccurate. the program has always been for 10 weeks. the administration came up here and talked with the committee about either making it 8 weeks or increasing local participation. finally. when it seemed they had takers on either. they settled for 9 weeks. and the committee went along with them. but the program has always been a 10week program. all i am doing is reinforcing my plea to the chairman. i would hope very much that perhaps today or tomorrow morning the senator would feel free to confer with his colleagues about the possibility of accepting so much of our amendment as would be required to maintain the program as a 10week programand that amount is $38 million.
it would extend the program for the same number of jobs as the committee recommended. but the committee. of course. by whatever figure it added. could add more jobs if it stayed at the 9week period. our amendment proposes $59 million. which would add 40.000 jobs and maintain the program as a 10week program. but in the hopebecause of our parliamentary situation the next couple of days. of getting some agreement with the committee on the floor i had advanced the other suggestion. but the basis for our amendment is  along that line.
i think that. on the whole. i would like longer jobs. that is why i moved as i did. the senator happens to be demonstrating typical new england frugality because. as the senator may k. it will cost less money to fill the mayors slots with 9week jobs than to take the existing slots provided by the committee and make them 10week slots. that is true. cxvii965---part 12 it would cost just about half of the figure we are talking about. but i thought that in view of the tradition of the program. perhaps if the committee felt that strongly about its figure on slots. it would at least give us the continuance of the program at the 10week period. naturally. from the point of view of domestic tranquility. the 10week program is to be preferred. i do  see any way to avoid that. that would take. for the same number of slots. $38 million.
. i want to raise aher issue on the supplemental. it relates to the office of miity business enterprise. we are deeply interested in facilitating miity business enterprise which helps the black and similar communities. the budget request was $298.000 and i e that the committee denied anything. though the house allowed $130.000. this money would be used to publicize the program. to set up mesbics and to give technical assistance to miity enterprises. senator ellender has informed me that the theory was to wait for the regular budget. but the difficulty is that it results in a delay of 6 months if that is done. and this is extremely valuable time in which they wanted to get the program going. it is  timely to fight about it here. but i hope that this matter will receive consideration when the house and senate conferees consider the question.
. the 89th congress has been dubbed "the education congress" because of the significant education programs authorized during 1965 and 1966. if we are wise egh to enact the education appropriations budget reported to us tuesday by the appropriations committee. this 92d congress can also be surnamed "the education congress." the $5.6 billion package  before us-$1.2 billion more than last years appropriationrecognizes the new needs in education. added to by rising enrollments and increasing costs. and at last goes far in meeting the pledge made by congress to the american people in the authorizing statutes of the past two decades. the appropriations committee. and especially the subcommittee on laborhew which handled this particular bill. deserve much credit for the constructive and thoughtful legislation which they have produced. senator magnuson. the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. and senator cotton. the distinguished ranking miity member of the subcommittee. are especially owed a debt of gratitude for this farreaching measure which they and their colleagues on the subcommittee have crafted. i should like to discuss several particulars of h.r. 7016. including the expression of some concerns.
there is effort to cut the $67 million. there is challenge to the impacted aid program by us or by the mover of this amendment. therefore. before we become very indignant about the large deficit and the large appropriations. let us look at this matter in proportion. ten percent is sought for the great cities of the country and their children.
. together with 13 cosponsors. i introduce. for appropriate reference. a series of measures requiring that a reasonable ecoical percentage of recycled scrap materials be used in federal construction and lrocurement programs. which would total some $31.3 billion in fiscal 1972. cosponsoring these measures with me are senators hatfield. humphrey. kennedy.
. i should like to ask the senator from wisconsin this question and. because it is phrased in terms i have received from the administration. i will read it in those terms. i ask the senator whether he is. in effect. committed to holding hearings on the proposed manpower revenue sharing act of 1971 and to do everything in his power to see that comprehensive manpower reform legislation is enacted in this session of congress. which means that hearings will have to be held in this session of congress as well. i wish to advise the senator from wisconsin that i have and i hereby do undertake that commitment as ranking miity member of the whole committee.
. i am sorry to take the time of the senate. however. i did want to be sure that we all understand each other. with respect to revenue sharing. if it comes. we will accommodate ourselves to it. however. until it comes. we will  blow up any of the programs that we must have.
the senator from rhode island has already made clear that this operation spans only a fiscal year. that is all. at the end of that fiscal year. there is a totally new arrangement regarding the entitlements. so long as it is confined to that fiscal year. i do  see how it complicates the appropriations committees.
it is void at the end of the fiscal year unless there has been some supplemental or other operation. . i would like to read the statutory provision that resulted in this debate. it appears in the bill at page 164. line 17. through page 165. line 4. it reads: (b) if. during any period of any fiscal year. the funds available for payments under this subpart are insufficient to fully satisfy all entitlements under this subpart. the amount paid with respect to each such entitlement shall be ratably reduced. when sufficient funds become available for such purpose. the amount of payment to be applied to each holder of a basic grant shall be equal to the difference between the amount paid to that holder under the first sentence of this subparagraph and the amount determined under subsection (a) to be that to which that holder is entitled for that year. method of computing or manner of distribution of payments shall be used which is inconsistent with this subparagraph. and the clear interpretation of the whole scheme of distribution is that it is "during any period of any fiscal year."
. i wish to address myself to the new ecoic policy. as my colleague. the senator from utah has done. i shall be offering a measure which i hope will materially improve the administrations proposal for job development through an investment tax credit. the difficulty. as i see it. with the job development investment tax credit as it has been proposed is that it is essentially based on capital goods and does  have a direct and immediate relationship to the increase of employment as a direct consequence of the incentive which is furnished by the tax. therefore. on behalf of myself and senators brooke. cook. hatfield. ma-
. the conclusions thus reached by my staff merit the senates attention. there seems to be general agreement. for example. that a tax credit such as s. 2632 represents. could result in the creation of 500.000 additional jobs over and above current projections by the end of 1972. the cost of the treasury under one projection would be significantly less than the cost per job of the investment tax credit. the university of californias projection actually comes out with a net gain to the treasury from my bill. professor roberts testimony also includes some very illuminating theoretical considerations relating to the advisability of a tax credit for additional employment. i believe the conclusions reached in these two excellent pieces of testimony * are convincing. and should add constructively to the current debate. i ask unanimouz consent that they be printed in the record.
exactly. they are paying out in debt service more than onehalf of what they get. and in many countries it is equal. it is simply like creating new slums when we put up public housing. that is something we want to avoid. and it is exactly the same kind of philosophy.
. the states and local governments and indeed the country itself are strapped with fiscal problems. at such a time. especially. i do  think it appropriate for moneys from the general fund of the treasury. raised in this instance from taxes on alcohol. to be transferred to the already bulging highway trust fund. these moneys are needed urgently for some of the other critical problems we face. for this reason i have joined with senator percy in an effort to delete that provision of the tax billh.r. 10947which would authorize 7 percent of the alcohol taxes to be transferred permanently into the highway trust fund without any specific direction on how the moneys are to be spent. in addition. senator ribicoff and i are introducing an amendment which we will. call up if the amendment to delete the alcohol provision fails. this amendment would require that the moneys from the alcohol taxes transferred into the trust fund be used on urban mass transit facilities and commuter lines. that is. to further the aims of the urban mass transportation acts of 1964 and 1970. certainly this is one of those critical uses to which general revenues should be put. the country is facing a mass transportation crisis. in new york state we are at a moment when we face a very real fiscal crisis and. in new york city. serious jeopardy to the subway system because of the failure to pass the transportation bond issue 2 weeks ago. this amendment may add a measure of assistance to new york city and other urban areas in a similar situation.
 that is  so. because the man must work 7 hours a day in order to earn for the employer the tax credit. in other words. he has got to be a fulltime employee. he has got to work 7 hours a day in order to earn that tax credit.
. the arguments made against the amendment. i think. can be answered very effectively. first. they say that i do  take care of the mergers or consolidations. i do. the amendment gives the treasury the power to make rules and regulations to see that the purpose and the intent of this section is  cheated by mergers and consolidations. second. we have the bugaboo of $4 to $6 billion a year loss. i k why they have used that figure. however. aside from that. if we spend $4 to $6 billion. the boom that would cause would end the unemployment problem in this country. the problem is 2 million jobs. that is the difference between 4 and 6 percent unemployment. 2 million jobs. i think that congress would be very happy to pay $4 to $6 billion for that purpose. however. aside from that. the reason for the fallacy in the figures is that they are quoting the gross figure. they do  give credit for the fact that. if 500.000 people are employed. the treasury will get a certain amount of revenue. our figures have been confirmed by the federal reserve board. they do  pass on the amendment. but they confirm that we are figuring correctly. this is $1.8 billion. the loopholes have been closed with respect to overtime. full time. mergers. consolidations. and new firms. if the senate wants a tax credit. washed out by adr. that is directly calculated to produce jobs. then we should agree to this amendment.
. i have introduced the amendment because i am the ranking miity member of the joint ecoic committee and the joint ecoic committee miity has emphasized the importance of this information. in 1969 i tried to move it as a tax bill and withdrew the amendment when i was assured the information would be made available to us. it was made available for 1969.  the treasury department opposes this amendment and they say that any representative or senator can get the information. the senator from louisiana
 but i would like 30 seconds to say this. on the question of jurisdiction: the finance committee has jurisdiction over the treasury department. the government operations committeeits chairman has just spoken. and he likes this proposalhas jurisdiction over all government departments. but we generally stay our hand when the committee or the senate is acting on a matter which is directly relevant to the department concerned. the secretary of the treasury deals with all treasury matters. this is a tax matter. and therefore i respectfully submit it belongs in this bill.
. i think the critical point here. which is being emphasized all over the place. is the very generality of the amendment as a complete grant of power by congress on a tax bill. without the basis of trade hearings as to the new competitive situation. the new situation of multinational corporations. and so forth. that is why i used the word "artless." because we are depriving ourselves of authority that we may want to use tomorrow. yet here it is connected in some way to a peripheral amendment which is  even germane.
ial campaign which involves all the heat and involves the checkoff. which is an ingenious idea. if compelled to vote yea or nay on that. i will have to decide what i will wish to do but i am  committing myself at this stage. but i believe what the senator from kentucky has offered is the decent way out. because we are holding this bill hostage which is a critically essential bill to ecoic stabilization in the country. and is of great political significance but is  germane to the existing struggle and crisis in the country. this is unwise from the point of view of the american people. i see a possible veto coming up and i believe that such a veto will be sustained. i believe we will then have to double back on our tracks and pass a tax bill without this particular campaign scheme. that will be the scenario except that the world will be kept in doubt as to the solution of the american ecoic crisis for at least aher 90 days and that. i think. would be difficult and unwise.
 is going to open the door to new relationships with the peoples republic of china. when the salt talks are going on. and when people are getting frustrated by the twin engines of inflation and unemployment.
that is right. the only thing is. i did  frontally establish a productivity commission by law. i learned that i could pick up the presidents commission and give it authority. so the amendment does  give it a statutory base. but it gives it authority to do something under the statute. the only thing i omitted from the previous amendment was that congress by law was establishing this commission. i simply picked it up from the fact that it already exists.
. aher problem which very seriously affects our country. and which i k worries us all. whether individual members are for or against this particular amendment. is the motivation of the american worker. i think this is what is really getting us. we are being skinned alive by germany and japan in world trade. and withstanding the new turn of our trade unions toward protectionism. it is still a fact that we k that if the world markets collapse. we will be in a recession or a depression. that has always been the history. and it will be the history again. even though we like to salve our feelings with the fact that only 8 percent of the american ecoy is in exports and imports. as compared with 30 percent for britain. belgium. holland. or germany. but if the crunch is on. and world trade collapses. we will find that that 8 percent. when you add to it the invisibles of banking. insurance. travel. and many other things which relate to the ecoic status of a great country like our own. will drag us down. just as much as it will drag down nations that are heavily dependent upon foreign trade. we are being skinned alive in the markets of the world precisely because there is the feeling. the dangerous feeling. on the part of much of american business and many american workers. that something has gone out of us. that there is an erosion of motivation. of incentive. of interest. of the work ethic which has been so dominant in our country in its earlier days and its immigrant days. and i think it is high time to try. because the exigencies are just as great as those of war. to arouse an interest in our people in work. in the joy of the perfection of work. and in the joy of teamwork. this is why these productivity councils worked so well in world war ii.
. i am  informed by my staff that the $10 mllion figure was arrived at as a result of inquiries we made of the national productivity commission. so it is a fairly authoritative estimate as to what it would cost to set up this local structure.
i thank my colleague very much. if he will bear with me for one further point. the conference report authorizes $2 billion in appropriations for child development care for the first year in which it is fully spelled outto wit. fiscal 1973. $100 million is provided for fiscal 1972 for startup activities. it has been my understanding that the $2 billion authorization is intended by the conferees as a goal which we have established. without king what the total picture may be at the time of appropriation. for example. we do  k what may be available from other sources such as the family assistance plan. h.r. 1. if that should become law.
. first i wish to join with the chairman of the committee on appropriations in praise and appreciation for the fine job that has been done and the courage shown by the subcommittee presided over by the senator from washington in this critically important field. i would just like to underline what has already been said to point out that provision whatever was made for an extra appropriation for nursing schools in the administration request. it is almost inconceivable that could be passed by. but it was until it was corrected by the senator from washington. ------------------------------------i read the analysis which is available of the items increased and the reasons. and i agree thoroughly. i would like to ask the senator this question: in view of the fact that the administration request is so low and so unrealistic-$350 millionas against an allowance of almost $650 million. and even that is some $500 million under the authorization. but i still think the senator has done magnificently. would it strengthen the senators hand if we had a separate rollcall vote on this amendment to show the solidarity of the senate behind it. as a member of the subcommittee and the committee on appropriations i k what happens when we get into conference with a $650 million appropriation and there has been an administration budget request of $350 million. we want to strengthen the hand of the senator from washington if he thinks it would help. i would be happy to ask for it as a separate vote if the senator feels it would strengthen his hand.
. when the senate debated the tax bill it agreed to an amendment. which i had offered. which would have required inclusion in the annual budget of treasury estimates of "tax expenditures." which are revenue losses from special tax provisions. naturally i had hoped that the house would recede from its disagreement to this amendment and i am disappointed that it did . however. i am gratified that the conferees have arranged for reporting of the tax expenditure data compiled by the treasury to the tax committees of the congress. it is my understanding that this data will be presented in less detail than in the 1968 annual report of the secretary of the treasury. this format will be most useful. the department of the treasury has also undertaken to furnish this information to the joint ecoic committee. which will thereby be in a position to analyze tax expenditures in connection with its annual report. it is my hope that current data will be provided to the joint ecoic committee promptly at the beginning of each calendar year. at the same time as the annual and the committees preparation of its report. i very much appreciate the efforts of the conferees and the cooperation of the department of the treasury on this matter. i ask unanimous consent that the appropriate passage from the conference report. describing the arrangement with the treasury for making this information available to the congress. and also the letter from senator proxmire and myself to secretary connally and the reply of john s. an. deputy assistant secretary. be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. i believe that the regular availability of tax expenditure information to the congress is a step toward rational budget priorities and tax reform. i understand that it is the intention of the joint ecoic committee to publish this information so that it will also be available to the public. which should be fully informed of the revenue losses in question. furthermore.  that it has been agreed that tax expenditure data can and will be provided in a meaningful and systematic manner to the congress and to the public. i believe that it is appropriate for the committee on government operations to consider how such data can best be coordinated with the annual budget. it may still be useful in clarifying the meaning of tax expenditures to have a format setting forth and comparing both indirect tax expenditures and direct outlays. in his testimony before the joint ecoic committee in 1969 secretary barr made such a comparison and it was most illuminating. i thank my colleague.
in other words. the senator will  be here when the conference report is voted on. my first question is: it is a fact. is it . that the socalled productivity t amendment providing for local and regional productivity commissions haing been in both the senate and the house bills is in the conference report. i
i may say that the senator from montana has told us how to do itto wit. get egh incentive for action. i take that as a mandate. i shall join. feeling that we are engaged in a great debt of ho to the senator from wisconsin. in trying to bring this about. i think our job is very clear. i think the majority leader has been very fair today. it is up to us to show him that the time has come to have it brought up. and i think we will do it.
i think the real problem is the precipitous decline in the amount of bilateral aid. we all agree on phasing toward the multilateral concept of aid. but what we are phasing and how we phase is critically important. i submit for the record. a table which shows that the percentage beginning with 1964. when it was 56 percent. has gone down to 15 percent in fiscal 1971. it would be a slightly lesser percentage still even if $200 million were authorized for fiscal
 ernest keller. this material has been .selected from the annual report of the adela for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1971. which has just been released. it is my hope that these excerpts will -provide a welcomed addition to the debate concerning the role of private foreign investment in latin america.
so. . the key to the proposition which we laid before the senateincidentally. this has  been the law for the last 8 yearsis that what this amendment would seek to do is cancel away much of that law. it seems to me that should  be the attitude of the senate. in face of the fact. as i say. that employees are  fully protected by the exclusive remedy which is sought to be compelled by this amendment. it seems to me. therefore. that if we are to give this assurance that we are really and genuinely open about this and that we are trying to deal with the problem of discrimination in employment. which we consider to be basic. then we should allow the remedies presently available to continue to be available. one last thought which is critically important. it is well knand i speak from personal experience. since i was a party to the debate and the controversy which ensuredthat the price of the civil rights act of 1964 was a very weak job discrimination title. that was the price exacted. and that was the price paid. that is why we are hereto button that upbecause time and the emous backlog of cases in the equal employment opportunity commission indicate that this is a serious deficiency in the structure of our antidiscrimination law. under those circumstances. before we ever have had an opportunity to make these laws more effective.  by such an amendment. if it becomes law. we will dismantle what is already the law and thereby make a grave mistake. it seems to me that is the absolute. clinching argument in respect of what we are trying to accomplish. we are going to take perhaps two steps forward and then take one step backward if we adopt the amendment. i think this is most unfair to the proposition which the senate would be espousing if we passed the bill. i would like to emphasize the importance of this amendment. those who suffer from job discrimination. those who endeavor to right job discrimination. are deep and firm in their conviction that one of the most critical issues on the bill is what is incorporated in the amendment. should the amendment be adopted. a very critical aspect of the enforcement of antidiscrimination in respect of employment or jobs will have been affected. with a very critical weakening of the whole structureso much so that many of these people feel the bill is  worthwhile. matter what is left in it. if it has in it destruction of what is in the law today. for all these reasons. i can emphasize egh to the senate the importance of defeating the motion to reconsider. that is the reason why we were deeply alarmed when the tie vote occurred. because there was a very slim attendance in the senate. we are extremely fortunate that it was a tie. the same kind of absence could have resulted in the amendments prevailing. we have a chance to go ahead. with the senate  having an attendance. as shown by the last vote. of 83 members. to defeat the motion to reconsider and lay the matter at rest and have the senate decide the policy. at a time when everybody. including the senator from colorado . who is arguing on the ceaseanddesist order issue. agrees that we are at least trying to do more than we have. at a time when we are trying to increase the enforcement power in regard to discrimination in employment. it is certainly  the time in which to dismantle a very important series of remediesand again i use that wordwhich would be dismantled were this amendment to be adopted.
. in placing this material in the record i invite the attention of senators to the fact that the funding level for the undp in fiscal year 1971 is very much in dispute since the house of representatives did  provide any funds for this most worthwhile organization in the fiscal year 1972 appropriation bill. it is my hope that the senatehouse conferees will rectify this matter. since the senate provided almost full funding. finally. i would like to wish paul hoffman boundless good health and fruitful new labors as he enters his 80th year.
. we have gone very far in the number of senators who have signed the cloture motion. only 16 senators are required for a cloture motion. designedly the senator from new jersey and i set out to get 51 signatures of senators. a constitutional majority. i k i express our joint gratitude to all who joined with us because we wanted to demonstrate how conclusively is this sentiment on the part of the senate. the constitutional majority. that the time has come to vote. even  amendment will be cut off. any amendment at the desk would be qualified by a suitable unanimous consent up to the vote. and thereafter members will have an opportunity to have amendments voted on. every member having an hour. i regret the form the bill has . but etheless it is the will of the senate and if we wish the will of the senate to be expressed in voting on this matter we must be willing to accept it after full and fair debate. as it is. i am fully cognizant of that and on other occasions i have defended vigorously the will of the senate in conference. even though i might have voted the other way. i have doubt that the senator from new jersey feels the same way i do. i do  use this expression in any invidious sense. but i wish to say that we accept the watering down of the enforcement power. we did it in the broader interest of getting a bill to deal with the worst of all discrimination. denial of jobs cxviii291--part 4 or the opportunity for jobs on the grounds of race. religion. color. national origin. or sex. we are satisfied there is a measurable improvement over what we have had up to  and that it will result in materially cutting down the backlog of equal employment opportunity cases and giving a much better opportunity to protect constitutional guarantees. this cloture motion contains the highest number of signers in any civil rights bill. there was a measure in 1926 that had more signers that involved a branch banking bill. but this is the largest number of signers on a bill involving civil rights. i join the senator from new jersey in expressing great satisfaction in working with him in an extremely difficult debate. i doubt any more difficult matter has been carried out in this chamber.
. this amendment proposes to establish 10 supergrade jobs in the equal employment opportunity commission to deal with the added responsibilities which are vested in the commission. i shall  call it up today or deal with it today. if that is agreeable to the manager of the bill. but it can be the pending amendment overnight. i will lay before the senate that amendment for consideration. i will  press it today.
. this contradicts the experience of 34 states with laws involving the right to get ceaseanddesist orders. a far stronger remedy than we even have in this bill . for a denial of equal opportunity respecting jobs and job training.
the fare was a dime. that was when the population was around 180 million. today we have a population in excess of 210 millionaccording to the latest estimate. today the fare averages 29 cents and ridership has fallen to 7.3 billionthat is. per year. in 1945 the transit industry was making $148 million a year. last year. it lost $332 million. the estimate for fiscal 1973 is approximately $400 millionthe exact amount authorized by one amendment for the operating subsidy. the physical condition of these services. . i reserve the remainder of my time.
. it seems to me the answer is contained in the committee report. apart from my own advocacy. as well as what the senator has just said. the senator has just said it has been referred to three committees. it is in the revenue sharing bill. we all k there will be action on revenue sharing this year-
. i introduce the community manpower training and employment act of 1972. a bill designed to establish a communitybased program of manpower training and jobs for ecoically disadvantaged. unemployed and underemployed persons. i am joined by the following cosponsors: senators boggs. brooke. hatfield. and
 of the aflcio. and peter peterson. secretary of commerce. in an exchange of letters. i ask unanimous consent that this exchange of letters be printed in the record. also. i ask unanimous consent that a letter i have received from the chairman of the federal reserve board on the burkehartke bill be printed in the record.
. the effectiveness of existing programs has stemmed in large part from the fact that the secretary could enter into grants and contracts extending over at least a years duration. thus providing security to those engaged in the program and. in many cases. insuring the involvement of the private sector. without deletion of this section. the secretary could enter into contracts up until the date of the acts expiration. june 30. but the contract or grant itself could only authorize activities through december 30for a 6month period. thus effectively undermining the program through fiscal year 1973.
. next week will be world trade week. commerce today. the publication of the u.s. department of commerce. indicates that secretary of commerce peter peterson has estimated that between 60.000 and 70.000 jobs are added for every $1 billion placed on the plus side of the national trade ledger. this is often overlooked to present a balanced picture since congressional ofrices are more likely to get letters from persons who have lost jobs because of imports or because of "runaway plants" than they are from persons who have found jobs because of exports or to service overseas private investment activities. it would be my prediction though that if legislation highly restrictive of trade were passed. that the flow of mail we are presently receiving could undergo a significant shift as those adversely affected would realize that such legislation may cost them their livelihoods. in connection with world trade week the department of commerc5 will distribute some 40.000 posters carrying the message that exports (too) create jobs. in a recent address secretary peterson developed the interest that the american consumer has in the burkehartke legislation. this again is an area that is overlooked primarily because the american consumer has  been organized as effectively as have other groups. however. such organizational efforts are underway and the growing political feeling of the consumer has been felt on such recent issues as sharply increasing meat prices. i ask unanimous consent that secretary petersons fine speech entitled "consumers and the hartkeburke bill" and an article on the importance of this legislation. published in the may 15 issue of the wall street journal. be printed in the record.
yes. and the senate figure was $247 million. that is right. the compromise was just about down the line. as far as the committee is concerned. it allowed some $15 million for summer recreation instead of the $12.8 million proposed by the house or the $21.9 million proposed by the senate. and $145.5 million for neighborhood youth corps summer job program instead of $82 mllion proposed by the house or the $223.9 million proposed by the senate. as far as transportation is concerned. it allowed some of the funds to be used for that purpose. if necessary. and agreed with the house. subject to concurrence by the two houses. that the money would be available until september 30. 1972. this will provide about 750.000 9week jobs with provision for recreation and transportation. as i have just indicated. i wish to thank the conferees very much for the result which has been attained with great particularity. i thank the senator from new hampshire . the senator from washington
 for setting aside partisanship to support the product of the ways and means committee and its very able chairman. in the final analysis. i shall support any revenuesharing proposal which combines significant aid with fiscal responsibility. above all. i do  want revenue sharing to be construed as a giveaway program and an inducement to fiscal irresponsibility at the state and local levels. however. i hope that the finance committee will consider the bill at hand in the proper context of meeting the real needs of citizens for adequate government services. in this regard. there is more work to be done in sharpening the distribution formula. reassessing overall the level of assistance. and considering supplements or alternatives.
. i would like to express my deep concern about some recent legislative developments affecting international health. to wit. the proposed cutback in the u.s. contribution to the world health organization. on may 18. the house of representatives. during consideration of the state department appropriations bill for fiscal year 1973. voted to reduce from 30.8 percent to 25 percent the u.s. contribution to the united nations and the various u.n. agencies. one of these affected agencies is the world health organization. whose contribution to the peace and wellbeing of the world is virtually unquestioned. the effect of the house action on who would be extremely serious. the u.s. assessment for calendar year 1972 is $26.3 million. the proposed cutback to 25 percent of the who regular budget would reduce the amount of money available to who by some $5.5 million. moreover. under the house bill. the reduction would be effective immediately. since the u.s. funds for whos 1972 operations are paid out of the state departments fiscal year 1973 budget. in short. the money is due -$26.3 millionto help finance whos current operations. it is expected that such a step as proposed by the house would seriously impede many ongoing. successful. and very valuable programs. a related issue is the question of the legitimate treaty obligations of the united states. every 3 years. the assessments for each member nation of the u.n. are negotiated during the u.n. general assembly meetings. the assessment for 1972 has been determined by previous negotiations. and as a signatory to the u.n. charter. the united states is obliged to pay its assessment. we have often pointed an accusing fingerand rightly soat those nations who in the past have refused to pay their legitimate u.n. assessments. i submit that we can  afford. in good conscience to join those defaulting nations. this is exactly what would happen. however. if the language of the housepassed appropriations bill is allowed to stand. i am in agreement that the u.s. share of the u.n. budget should be reduced. however. this should  be done unilaterally. because this very fall. during the u.n.s general assembly meetings. the national asessments are to be renegotiated. that is the proper. legal forum in which to reduce the u.s. contribution. many leading members of the international community are equally convinced of the need to reduce the u.s. contribution. and the administration is on record as being strongly in favor of such a reduction and to negotiate the u.s. assessnment down to 25 percent. even the director general of the world health organization is on record as being in favor of a reduced u.s. contribution as a means ofmore equitably distributing the influence of the various member nations. in light of this. i think we can feel assured that the negotiations this fall will solve the problem of the high u.s. assessment. on may 31. the senate appropriations committee approved. as part of its version of the fiscal year 1973 state department appropriations bill. a reduction of the u.s. contribution to 25 percent. it provided that it would  be effective before january 1. 1973. this would solve the problem of the u.n.s and the whos immediate fiscal crises. but i continue to favor allowing the negotiators to work out this problem in accordance with the existing u.n. charter provisions.
 of the united states. dwight d. eisenhower. and minted under the authority of section 101(d) of the coinage act of 1965. and section 203 of the bank holding company act amendments of 1970. the amount received by the secretary for each minted proof dollar coin being $10 per coin.
. i wish to call attention to that part of the committee report which relates to operating subsidies in lowcost public housing. the report states that hud allotted $170 million for these payments. the committee itself considered this amount grossly inadequate and invited the department to submit a supplemental request to cover the cost when an accurate estimate of what they will be in the coming fiscal year may be obtained. the range of the estimate is as high as $497 million with a minimum of $320 million. in view of the magnificent participation over the last few years in this matter by the senator from massachusetts
there is time limit. . in my own city of new york. on a number of occasions in the past 4 years. local legal services offices have been forced to suspend their activities due to lack of funds. the committee bill would reserve for each of the next 2 fiscal years $71.5 million for the legal services programs. the amount requested by the administration for the coming fiscal year. incidentally. this represents an increase of $10.4 million over fiscal 1972. in addition. it authorizes. as an addon $100 million for the program for each of the fiscal years 1973 and 1974.
we are very interested in revenue sharing. obviously. so that we can all be thinking about it during the next few weeks. i wonder whether the senator can tell us something about amendments to the revenue sharing bill and what the situation is between us and the other body in respect of any very substantial amendments to the revenue sharing bill.
. this adds $1 million to the bill. this is a rather unique situation. i would like to lay it before the senator from mississippi and i hope very much he might see fit at least to take it to conference where it could be perhaps deliberated upon and the conferees could decide on what should be done. the fire island to montauk point hurricane protection project was authorized in the rivers and harbors act of 1960public law 86645. the scope of this hurricane protection project is so large that it is clearly recognized that it will require many. many years to complete. moneys have in fact been made available to new york state over the past 12 years for this project. this year. however. a budget item did  appear to continue the project. i am advised by the state of new york that the reason it did  appear this year is that at the time the corps was preparing its fiscal year 1973 budget request. the state was unable to assure the corps that state funds would be available to match an appropriation during the federal fiscal year 1973. i have been advised today by james biggans. executive deputy commissioner of the new york state department of environmental conservation. that new york state will be able to provide funds for the fire island inlet to montauk point hurricane protection project to match a federal appropriation of $1 million during fiscal year 1973. i would like. at this time. therefore. to offer an amendment to h.r. 15586 for the purpose of including $1 million for the continuation of work on the fire island inlet to montauk point hurricane protection project. in this connection. i must call attention to the federalstate cost sharing formula applied to this hurricane protection project. i introduced to the 1970 rivers and harbor actpublic law 91611an amendment to clarify the funding of multiple purpose projects which were largely hurricane protection projects. multiple purpose hurricane protection projects have been funded at all ratesvarying from 50 to 70 percent for the federal shareleading to much confusion. it was felt by the congress that projects which are predominantly for hurricane protection should be funded at the 70 percent level. however. the statutory language left it to the discretion of the chief of engineers to determine the formula. even though it was understood that the corps would make every effort to fund projects mainly for hurricane protection at the 70 percent level. i have been advised that the chief of engineers has informed new york state that he has  found sufficient basis to apply 70 percent federal cost share as provided in section 208 of public law 91611. i fully support the position of the state that the intent of congress in passing this section. was to cover specifically projects like this one. in an effort to clarify this issue. members of the new york state congressional delegation have requested a joint meeting with the office of management and budget and the corps of engineers. although this meeting was requested some months ago. neither omb  the corps has seen fit to meet with the delegation to clarify this matter. in addition. i am advised that the new york state department of environmental conservation has separately requested a meeting with the corps of engineers of their own district in an effort to reach some agreement on the matter and that. that request for a meeting has  been met either. it seems to me that every effort is being made on the part of the state as well as the delegation to come to some understanding on this important matter. and i would like to.take this opportunity to e the necessity of straightening this out at once for the benefit of all projects such as the fire island inlet to montauk point project which are affected. if it is finally determined that this should be a 5050 project. the corps has advised that they have sufficient funds previously appropriated to continue work on the project. if however. it is determined that this should be a 7030 project. the corps will  have sufficient funds available for the project. by the very nature of the amendment which i sponsored and which became the intent of congress. i must assume that this hurricane protection -project will be a 7030 project. and that either an administrative or a legislative clarification of this specific case will be made. therefore. i am requesting that $1 million be added to h.r. 15586. the public works appropriations bill. the recent severe and crippling damage which new york state suffered from hurricane agnes clearly emphasizes the need for hurricane protection projects. this project will do much to protect already established communities along long island and fire island. one .of the most beautiful seashore areas in the nation. hopefully. it will be completed before irreparable damage has been done to lives and property in the target area. and before irreparable damage has been done to the valuable resource which the beaches represent. the only way i can see to solve the problem would be by asking the conferees to give it their consideration. by dealing only with the corps of engineers the whole matter will be stymied on this issue as to whether it should be 50 percent or 70 percent. i hope very much as a matter of accommodation to the state of new york the senator from mississippi might consider favorably allowing us to go one step further by getting this question in the conference.
. i am aware of that authority. i have very grave doubts about whether that changes the opportunities for ablebodied workers to be preempted from jobs on the basis of the youth differential. this is a very hohest difference of opinion between us. i am very well aware of the secretarys authority.
. both the senator from new jersey and i omittedand i am sure that he would want me to say this---saying that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the senator from west virginia . who had a heavy responsibility and a great deal to do with contriving the unanimousconsent agreement which was the basis for our ability to pass the bill. it was one of the best jobs i have ever seen him do. and i have seen him do a great many. we all owe him a great debt of gratitude and so does the country.
the office simply advises congress and all committees thereof of the three things set forth. i would like to ask the senator to read them. i am only relating to the senator the provisions of the bill which begin on page 11. the key functions are as follows: (1) an analysis. in terms of national goals and priorities. of the programs in the annual budget submitted by the president. the ecoic report of the president. and the social report of the president. (2) an examination of resources available to the nation. the foreseeable costs and expected benefits of existing and proposed federal programs. and the. resources and cost implications of alternative sets of national priorities. and (3) recommendations concerning spending priorities among federal programs and courses of action. including the identification of those programs and courses of action which should be given greatest priority and those which could more properly be deferred. in short. it is the overview or whole relationship between the executive branch and congress. for example. i do  k whether the senator was here when i said that secretary of the treasury george shultz appeared before us this morning and said. "you should set in congress a spending ceiling." he suggested $250 billion. then. he said that in that $250 billion ceiling you ought to determine your priorities. and "we will tell you what we think the priorities should be." i said. "is  congress entitled to in some way take an overall view and say what it thinks should be done." i said. "we have machinery for that purpose. would you agree we should have." he said he thought we should.
the senator is correct. the presidents agency will tell us what it thinks. secretary shultz testified that we have to spend onethird of the $250 billion for defense. that is their view. but what will be our view. but then they come along and say. "we have room for any new program in the next year." why. they assume the budget is so tight there is money for it. that does  mean we have to do it that way. but e of us here have the overall picture. this would porvide overall information for the congress to proceed intelligently. the executive has us outsmarted every time. they have the facts. the figures. and the expertise. and we simply can match it. this is some effort to get abreast in terms of goals and priorities between congress and the executive.
. this is but aher example of restrictive amendments which look so good on their face when it is said that they will help american labor and help american shipbuilding. however. we never figure on the side effects. and it is the side effects that kill us. at long last. the consumers strike out against these rigidities which the farm people long ago realized the consumers would rebel against. in the final analysis. they ran into trouble. and they are  taking the place of the trade unions as the advocate of reciprocal trade and the trade unions have gone protectionist. this works out so that we have retaliation and more closed doors as well as increasing the cost of living unduly. it taxes the consumers who do  receive the benefits. the more we have to depend on foreign oil the more that retaliation will come about in many respects. including the matter of ultimate responsibility. so i believe that the restrictiveness of trade is counterproductive to the interests of the country. i am glad that the consumers are awakening to that fact. and i want to help them awaken further to it. for those basic reasons. i support the amendment of the senator from new hampshire.
 has reaffirmed old commitments such as generalized preferences for the developing world and is in the process of making new commitments such as mfn for the soviet union. his authority to negotiate trade concessions has long ago expired. it is my view that there will be a major trade battle in the congress within 2 years and the balance of trade position of the united states at that time with specific reference to our bilateral trade relations with japan could emerge as a major factor in the debate and vitally affect the nature of the legislation eventually passed. clearly the maintenance of a liberal. relatively open trading policy in the united states assumes particular importance when the continuing difficulties japan is having in expanding their trading relations with the european common market countries is considered. in turn. as western europe moves toward a free trade zone for western european industrial products in the years ahead. the impact of trade discriminatory policies could become more severe for major trading nations outside europe such as japan and the united states. it is my hope that the expanded european common market--eecand the countries which will become associated with the eec will opt for an outward looking. liberal trading order. however. the united states and japan. based on the past record of the eec. must begin  to develop contingency plans in case the eec chooses the inwardlooking protectionist rule. i would regret this and fear for the atlantic alliance and for the future ecoic and political growth of the free world as the consequence of a crystallization of protectionism. but i can rule out the possibility that western europe may turn inward and go protectionist just as i can rule out that the u.s. congress may also opt for this selfdefeating protectionist course. too. i continue to hope that west german and british influences will moderate the worst of frances intransigence on trade and monetary matters and in turn that the smithsonian agreement over time indeed will strengthen the u.s. balanceoftrade position. finally. as regards japan. the events of 1970 and 1971 have proven that japanese responses in the international ecoic areaswhich in the past could be characterized as "too little. too late"have had egh serious political consequences to provoke much thoughtfulness in japan. it would be my hope that the tanaka government will take this into consideration as new trade. aid. and monetary policies are formulated. future relationships between our two countries should  be crucified on the cross of a mercantilism which demands an ever larger national trade surplus. the trade surplus position of japan has grown explosively in recent years and respected japanese ecoists indicate that this surplus could increase in the years ahead. let me bluntly state that a $4 billion deficit on the trade account cxviii- 1728part 21 with japan is unacceptable in the united states. it is unacceptable because of the immediate and concentrated impact this surplus has on american jobs and american employment. since this problem is so clearly evident and since the failure to resolve this problem would have such grave consequences. it would be my expectation that responsible political leadership in japan can take the necessary steps to deal with it before events get out of hand. it is my fervent hope that the upcoming summit meeting will be successful and that the basis for a new. cooperative relationship between the united states and japan will be laid. since the nature of the united statesjapanese relationship in the years ahead will directly influence evolving relations with the peoples republic of china and the soviet union of both countries. the renewal of close united statesjapanese relations is of the highest priority on the foreign policy agenda of both nations. some may think me forehanded in calling rather dramatic attention to these opportunities as well as dangers. but so critical are the future relations between the united states and japan to world peace and world prosperity that i believe it is imperative that the authorities in both countries and the people of both countries be aware of the perils of continuing on the present course with particular regard to trade relations and the urgent need for major decisions which will reverse the present trend which could lead toward deterioration. rather than a strengthening of our vital relations.
. yesterdays finance committee action in adopting a substantially different formula from the house version of the revenuesharing bill. marks a setback for states and cities which sorely need revenue sharing . industrial states where the urban crisis is the worst. like new york. california. illis. and ohio. are singled out by the finance committee proposal. for example. compared with the house bill. new york loses $142 million through the finance committee bill. this is more than any other state. the chief difference between the finance committee bill and the house bill appears to be the absence of the factors of urbanized population and income tax effortas opposed to general tax effort--in the distribution formula. considering that urban areas are where the fiscal problems are the worst. and considering the need to encourage state and local income taxes. the finance committee formula is a big step backward for states which need revenue sharing the most. together with other senators i must do my best to get the whole senate to reverse this discriminatory action. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a list of states that will suffer most under the senate finance committee proposals. this list also indicates the difference in revenue flows to the states between the senate and house bill under the first year of operation of the program.
i thank my colleague very much. second. i ask the senator from wisconsin whether he feels with me that the situation calls for an expansion of funding for the legal services program. and that the authorizations which we have in the bill. $840 million for fiscal year 1973 and $870 million for 1974. which amounts are. respectively. $80 million and $110 million above the $760 million requested by the administration for the current fiscal year. 1973. are. therefore. susceptible of increased appropriations above the basic figure of $71.5 million reserved for the legal services program.
additionally. i ask the senator whether he agrees with me that various addon items which we had and which we dropped from this conference report. including $50 million for fiscal 1973 and $100 million for fiscal 1974 for legal services. were dropped solely as a means of getting the total authorization through. and that the deletion of these items in the conference should in way be construed as a finding by the conferees that the legal services program does  needas in fact it doessubstantially more than the $71.5 million reserved as a minimum.
. i support the amendment for that reason. and  because any state is profligate. because the states are too poor to be profligate in the sense that they are looking for help in these matters. let us remember that this is  a free program. states have to put up 25 cents for every dollar that the federal government matches. i k of many programs in my own stateand new york is supposed to be one of the affluent stateswhere they have a 10percent matching and the state has preferred  to come up with this money because of the difficulty in finding that type of money in an extremely tight and debtridden budget. my state has already cranked in the money it hopes to receive from the program. otherwise we would have a deficit budget. in new york. that would be quite a mouthful because in new york the democrats and republicans alike have always prided themselves on the fact that the budget is always balanced. even in difficult times. there is question about the fact that hew was far behind in the parade in  coming up with the proper regulations on this matter. this is  a free program. the federal government is  putting up the money. the state has to be willing to put up onefourth of the cost. as to the catalog of horrors stated by the senator from louisiana. one must understand that he gives estimates of what states and what amounts were involved in the particular horrible example he gives. all of these horrible examples can be swept away by intelligent regulations from the hew. so the senator talks about inequities of the past. we are dealing with an amendment that would take effect in the future.
i am going to tell the senator exactly that. because the states ability to finance this very bill has been reduced by more than that. the state is really badly up against it. that is what we see reflected in the bills. we have done the utmost to pay. ourselves. we can pay any more. so. unless the whole thing is to be shut off. we have to go to the only source which can help us. incidentally. that is why we are having revenue sharing.
. the amendment i have proposed is intended to correct a gross inequity in the bill as reported by the committee on finance. an inequity which did  arise in the bill sent here by the house because they did exactly what i am trying to do. at least in part. in terms of the amount of money in dealing with problems of the urban states. i will point out how heavily weighted this bill is against those urban states.  for but against them. and the grave disproportion that would result. i was treated to quite a lecture on disproportion regarding my state in connection with social services awhile ago. i am going to be able to point out the grave disproportion which states other than urbanized states are put into in this matter. whether they need it or . whereas the real crisis which brings on revenue sharing is brought on by the urbanized states. the states to which i refer are 27 in number. the urbanized states are 27 of the 50 states. this is a very critical matter. the amendment i have offered-
. the argument we just heard from the senator from utah may go down in history. because that is pretty much the way the bill is drafted. as the razzledazzle argument. whereby states receive less even though the need is more. i tried to catch the names of the states the senator read. the states of california. delaware. hawaii. and maryland get $130 million less under the bill of the committee on finance than they do under the house bill. that is $130 million less. these are the growth states. i have the full list of states that get taken for $524 million. but that is $130 million. the other part of the razzledazzle argument is that they wrote it so that i. coming from new york city. would feel they are getting more money. but the state is . and the state does a lot to support the people. many places in new york need money for important services and are very much harmed by this distribution. for example. there is a 7percent unemployment rate in our two socalled rich counties of nassau and suffolk. under the house bill nassau county would get some $27 million. and under the senate bill $16 million. i do  k how you can trick around that figure. suffolk county would get $21 million under the house bill and here it would get $13 million. a whole list of cities would be similarly situated. such as schenectady. utica. rome. and rochester. all of which will get less. the answer is what has been cranked in here. and that is why there is the razzledazzle argument for the $1 billion. it has been cranked in and the cities have been loaded against the states. that does  do us any good. what does do us good is a composite of what we get. in my state. the state spends over 50 percent of its revenue for the support of the cities. what you give in this hand you take away with the other hand by sweeping out the whole system and inserting $1 billion. you have already taken away several million dollars from my state and you are  going to replace it with revenuesharing funds matter how you compare the situation for new york city. the senator from rhode island with his great gift for putting his finger on the main point. has pointed this out clearly. the fact is that this bill has been rewritten so that it seriously prejudices the urbanized states. and whatever tricks you play with it. it still does so. it should be corrected. i do  agree that the senate will  vote for this amendment. i do  think the senate will refuse to vote for something that is desirable if it can be proven. if the senate rejects this amendment it is because we have  broken through with the facts and figures. but on the merits it does deserve to pass. and i urge the senate to agree to the amendment.
. i wish to tell the miity leader. under the circumstances. that i would be compelled to offer an amendment to the amendment. in order to get more time. so that i may have an understanding as to when we are likely to vote. the two things i should like to call to the senators attention. because he has brought them out very admirably. are these: all these things being quoted are what go to a particular municipality which may get more or less. depending on many factors. but as to what a state can do for the citiesit does a great deal. of coursethey get less. you can shine this mirror into your eyes so that you do  see anything. the second point is this: all these figures. including those cited by senator talmadge. trying to tell us that 32 states get less after the first year. is because they crank in this billion dollars. that is the biggest phony of all. because they are taking away with the one hand perhaps $3 billion and they are just authorizing a billion dollars. then you are supposed to take that. that is your urban dividend. again. that mirror shines in your eyes so that you do  see anything. we are u.s. senators. we are  children. the fact is that you will get less. a great deal less. and this bill is loaded against you. and it should  be. this is revenue sharing. so who puts up the revenue is very important. this is  some bill about rivers and harbors or health. it is revenue sharing. i do  agree with senator pastore. i do  give this up at all. i think we ought to fight like tigers here. a majority of the states of the united states are being prejudiced. there is a bias in this bill against them. we should overturn it. if we have the votes. let us do it. if we do . we should be held accountable. every one of us. by the people of the states.
i thank the senator. . i have a letter from the chairman of the federal reserve system which points out that the federal reserve system. due to an open market and other operations. much as it sympathizes with the purposes of this bill. simply can have the federal reserve advisory council within that same category. it is fine to live in a fish bowl. but everyone ks the speculation. financial. and otherwise. which goes on around the world respecting the federal reserve systems operations. in order to have an advisory council at all. which would be very useful to them. they simply have to ask to be exempted from the provisions of this bill. they point out that the expenses of the federal advisory council are paid by the federal reserve banks out of their own earnings. they really do  represent a charge upon the government. i ask unanimous consent that the letter addressed to senator mcclellan. chairman of the committee on government operations. from the chairman of the federal reserve board. dated june 2. 1972. be printed in the recore at this point.
. i ask unanimous consent that there be inserted in the record at this point a letter dated september 12. 1972. from assistant secretary malcolm lovell to me in response to my letter of august 18. 1972. also to be inserted. regarding the departments efforts for jobs for older persons to date.
 request such flexible authority. second. that trade is inherently linked with monetary matters and that you can negotiate one without the other. money is the medium of exchange for goods and the attempt to treat monetary problems in the abstract without consideration to the flow of goods is an impossibility. trade adjustments will affect the need and nature of future monetary adjustments just as changes in the par value of any currency have a direct and immediate effect on trade. third. gold can longer be the base of the new international monetary systemit is a commodity and should be relegated to the status of other commodities over a suitable transition period. let gold continue to serve as the medium that symbolically links man and wife and  as the medium in which the value of currencies is defined. only the productive strength of nations should serve as the standard of value of their currencies. the world ks that the productive strength of the united states can be measured on a fragile cross of gold. fourth. the link between future sdr creation and development assistance can serve as the emancipation proclamation of the developing world. this link is clearly the means for integrating the developing world into the mainstream of trade and commerce and it is my prediction that if this integration does  take place at an accelerated pace over the short term. that the industrialized world will have jeopardized its own future prosperity and wellbeing. better income distribution within societies leads to stronger societies and more sustained ecoic growth. as the united states and western european examples make clear. similarly. better income distribution among societies through the means of future sdr creation will lead to a stronger world trading and monetary system. accelerated world ecoic growth. and reduced tensions among nations.
. i am just as anxious as anybody else to get on with the business of the senate. but i do  think we ought to get on with the business at the cost of injustice. if the senate wants to legislate injustice. let it at least face the issue and vote it up or down and legislate it that way. the other thing that i think is only fair is this. we have a 2year bill here after the present fiscal year. that is 21/2 years. i see reason whatever. if we are going to roll over and play deadwhich is what we are doing because one member got up and said he did  like it and tried to marshal other states similarly situated. to say they do  like it. without any regard as to whether it is fair or unfairwhy this should be for 21/2 years. as is everybody else. i am under great pressure. but if the senate wants to go through with this. i will stay here tonight as long as it takes. including 3 oclock in the morning to resolve it properly rather than dismiss it due to the hour. that will be fine. injustice should  go unrecompensed.
 we have just had a discussion about this matter and in the effort to come to an agreement. in view of all the problems which we face. i would suggest that the bill be limited to 1 year after the current fiscal year. instead of 2 additional years as contained in the bill. and i am prepared to offer an amendment. if that will be acceptable. we can come back and reargue the case a lot sooner than if we had a 2year bill.
. is that the historic internal revenue service system of pension regulation has a single "handle"-the tax deduction claimed in a tax return. if there are insufficient contributions and deductions. is the internal revenue servicewhich after all is essentially a tax collection agencylikely to complain. i hardly think so and experience bears this out. and would workers complain to the internal revenue service. even this is unlikely. because if the complaint were sustained. the only remedy the internal revenue service has to disqualify the plan which results in even less money in the fund. i certainly do  mean to suggest that the tax qualification provisions in the internal revenue code are unwise or unnecessary or that the finance committee is out of line in maintaining its vigilance with respect to these provisions. on the contrary. the tax qualification standards are an essential component of the tax incentive which has been central to the development of the entire pension plan system. but tax qualifications alone are  egh. if we are prepared to legislate minimum .standards in the interest of protecting 30 million american men and womenand making those standards real and enforceablewe can leave out affirmative regulations directly enforceable at law. i have objection to the finance committee considering the matter. and i welcome their opinion even if i violently disagree with it. all that i argue is. "ok. that is fine. you have seen it." i do  want to see it stripped of everything meaningful. . while it is a hot issue. let us get to work at it and let the senate decide whether it wants a meaningful pension reform bill or wants to throw it into the ashcan. let us  drag it over until next year. next june or july or august. we have already had extensive hearings. the senate has authorized a large sum of money. and it is a mature bill of emous interest to infinitely more millions of americans than most of the bills which go through this body even . all i am saying. together with the senator from new jersey . is let us get the senate at it and let it decide whether it is going to go with this bill or whether it is going in the ashcan. i hope very much the senate will do that.
this is the first time i have heard the bills actually laid out. in other words. i have heard the distinguished majority leader give assurances to the distinguished senator from alabama that the busing bill. the socalled antibusing bill. would be called up and that there would be "must" legislation behind it. but i have  heard the bills laid out specifically and that the "must" legislation behind it would be the supplemental and the debt limit. i have  heard that done. therefore. i ask the distinguished acting majority leader whether this represents. . a new implementation of that commitment or whetherperhaps i did  hear it as i have  combed the record--the distinguished majority leader actually named those bills specifically as the bills which would wait on disposition of the antibusing bill.
pursuant to the general authority contained in this bill to reduce programs by 10 percenthaving the effect of cutting back on these vital manpower efforts. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed at this point in the record a chart prepared by the department of labor indicating the levels of appropriation for manpower services for fiscal year 1973. broken down by legislative source and program and compared with fiscal year 1972.
. i ask unanimous consent that a bill introduced today by senator percy. on the property tax reform and assistance act of 1972 be referred to the committe on government operations. and that if and when the bill should be reported. it be referred to the committee on finance for its consideration.
 to make cuts should  be given away free. we need something in return. in this regard. the most useful quid pro quo would be better access to the budget information compiled by the executive branch. in effect. we need a freedom of budget information act which is adapted to congressional needs. we deserve to k. for example. how the executive projects spending. by program. year by year. over the coming 5 years. we need to have access to the raw data upon which budget estimates are based. we need better figures as to the regional impact of various spending programs. these and many other kinds of data are essential for congress to perform minimal functions of representative democracy. of course. this recommendation ties in which the congressional office of goals and priorities * analysis. which would presumably be the agent of congress for receiving this data. what i am talking about is the effective functioning of our democracy. this * goes boynd the partisan rhetoric of *"congress is spending too much" on the one hand. versus "the administrations spending priorities are distorted" on the other. i offer my recommendations in this * partisan setting in hope that the persident. too. will support a system of budget planning and spending controls which works to continue to make democracy real for all americans. by preserving the power of congress.
. on june 7. 1972. andrew heiskell. the chairman of time inc. addressed the city club of new york on the grave fiscal problems facing our nation. our states. and our cities. all of us must share mr. heiskells concern over the budgetary situation and the implications this has for the future ecoic growth and stability of the united states ecoy. this relates also to our emous defense budget which continues to consume almost onethird of all budgetary expenditures. and to our continuing tragic involvement in vietnam. i share mr. heiskells evaluation that if the cities of america die. the communities within 50 miles of them. "will die on the vine." i ask unanimous consent that mr. heiskells address of june 7. 1972 and the new york times press report of june 8 on it be printed in the r.cor at this point.
. i wish to comment generally also on titles ix and x of the conference bill. title ix would establish a program of community service jobs for lowincome persons 55 years or older with an authorization of $100 million for fiscal year 1973 and $150 million for fiscal year 1974. title x. a complementary provision. would establish a program of manpower training and related services for unemployed and underemployed persons 45 years of age or older with an authorization of $100 million for fiscal year 1974. during fiscal 1973 it would be conducted through existing programs. i support both of these titles. in my opinion. these new measures constitute a necessary supplement at this time to the provision made for middleaged and older persons under existing manpower training. work experience. and employment programs. the conditions of unemployment and job scarcity which affect many of our citizens are particularly harsh in their effect on middleaged and older persons. most vulnerable to techogical change and subject as well to age discrimination. middleaged and older workers are often at a disadvantage in competing for.existing jobs in the labor market. as ranking miity member of the committee on labor and public welfare. and a member of its subcommittee on employment. manpower and poverty. i consider it my duty as i did when the bill was considered by the senateto indicate that the administration is opposed to the inclusion of these titles. their position is set forth in a letter to the conferees dated october which reads as follows:
. this amendment. which i shall  press for reasons which i will explain. would supply the necessary resources to allow an experiment to go forward in organizing the quality of work councils. these are labormanagement councils which deal with the broad subject of the improvement of the work environment through job enrichment and humanization of work techniques. it would be composed equally of labor and management. this idea originates from the organization of the national commission on productivity. which i have had a good deal to do with. and the appropriate authorization and the appropriation subsequently made to it. and is put forth as a project of the commission. but with the price commission headed by mr. grayson as its agent. in order to deal with a subject which troubles many of us very deeply. the erosion of morale in the american worker. we all k about it. and it is one of the most serious problems troubling this country. i used to call it a labormanagement council. but i like their idea of a productivity council better than mine because they are going  only into the question 3f productivity but productivity as it relates to interest in the job. attractiveness of the job. and conditions of the job. in terms of quality. the idea is to experiment with 10 of these councils. which would be either on an area basis or a plant basis. depending on the size of the enterprise. each of the 10 would cost $10.000. the national commission on productivity is ready to contribute $100.000. my amendment would call for $400.000 in order to enable the project to properly start off. i was going to press this amendment today. because i think it is so critical to get at this job. though i had just learned about the project within the last 24 hours. in order to avoid the 3 or 4 months which must elapse until we get aher supplemental bill. however. having discussed it with the senator from new mexico . i am persuaded that it is really too quick to ask the appropriations committee and the senate to act on it solely on the recognizance of mr. grayson and the persons who are working on the task. the senator from new mexico takes this very seriously. it certainly must be taken very seriously. it is one of the most critical problems in our country. he tells me he will give the parties a very good hearing immediately after we reconvene. so. much as i regret what may have to be the lapse of a few months. i express the hope that the climate which will have been created for the project will induce the national commission on productivity to put up its $100.000 so they can get started . and then the senator from new mexico can give them a hearing. then. we have every hope. as this looks very sound to me. that we will be able to furnish the additional resources required to proceed with this program

. as the senator ks. we are seriously hurt in new york by the situation which finally developed in revenue sharing on social services. our request was over $800 million. while this bill provides only $223 million. but i should like to ask the senator from louisiana as follows: if our hopes are dashed with respect to the stevens amendment where it is . would the senator be willing to see it put on some other bill where it might have a better likelihood of success in view of the fact that this is all for this fiscal year and it has to be done within an approximate time for the states to k where they stand. -
. this is really outrageous. it demonstrates that there is still a very heavy rural cast to the thinking here and in the other body. quite unrepresentative of what the country amounts to. where more than 70 percent of our people are in the cities. with that understanding of the situation. having fought the battle and lost it. i still want to make clear that this consummates our loss. that we had better  have any delusions about it. and that we will return to fight aher day. and to again express the hope that the chairman will at least save this small crumb of hold harmless and redistribution for the current fiscal year. upon which all these states have figured. including the 24 that are losing. and losing heavily. and that at least they will be somewhat held harmless for that period. it might interest the senators from those 24 states to k that in the other body. when this matter was debated. representative mills said that if you get an allocation of less under this bill for 1973. you may have to pay back money to the federal government. because this covers the current fiscal year. and unless you get the hold harmless clause. some of us may owe the federal government money. i do  think my state does. but others may. let us  forget that. i k that senator long will understand this and  consider it unfriendly. he is a pretty good fighter himself. i want to make that clear. i am under illusion on this matter. and whether we have a rollcall vote or . i wish to be recorded as voting "" because it is very unfair to the urbanized states. we will be back to fight this battle. there are many other things that people want. and things around here have a habit of leaning on each other. that is all i have to say at the moment.
. i am a member of the committee which the senator from arkansas. chairs so graciously. i have one question that i want to ask. the fundamental purpose of this committee is to take a look at the whole of the budget problem before congress. all of it together in one piece. and then make recommendations to the individually affected committees as to what it thinks they ought to do in respect of the total budget overview.
under the mitchellarmour law in my state. the same is true. except for this point. and the senator should keep this in mind: often they are especially set up under tax abatement agreements with local authorities. but that is true with federal projects. too. they are often set up under special tax abatement agreements. but in those cases. it takes two to agree. it is hing mandated by law. does the senator see my point.
we will check it again. . on the whole. however. it is a most depressing thing for urbanized states such as my own. where we have lost about $600 million when you add revenue sharing to this social services ceiling. and we have  really gained anything out of the muchvaunted revenuesharing machinery which was going to be of tremendous help to us. because these formulas have been distorted. it is a very depressing and deplorable time for the big states and the major cities which have such dreadful problems. it is going to put us to our mettle. especially with respect to what was supposed to be the popular branch of the legislature. but i shall vote for this report. because it is the only thing to do at this time. i pledge myselfand i hope others who represent the big states will do likewiseto do all i can to change the situation.
. since the senates adoption of s. 5. public law 92599. the debt ceiling bill. has established a joint committee to review operation of budget ceilings and to recommend procedures for improving cbngressional control over budgets. under that authority. the joint committee is required to report the results of its study and review to the congress later than february 15. 1973. as we proceed to consider s. 5. we will want to have the benefit of the recommendations of the joint committee in moving toward the establishment of an office along the lines that are provided under title ii. by mr. williams (for himself.
s. if this happens. the resulting product will do credit to what the american people expect of their government. something for all classesthe rich. the poor. the middle. and the modest levels. that shall be my objective. i hope that congress will equip itself so that it may. with responsibility and judgment. carry out that very grave function which it has  had the adequate staff. equipment and will to carry out. but which it must  put itself in the position to do if we are to carry out our constitutional duties. i ask unanimous consent that a statement i released today on the budget be included in the record.
 in an overall budget approach. so i express the hope and belief that he will make a real effort to do so. that he will put before the congress and the country. and fight for in the administration. as an advocate. what is needed for health. education. welfare. child care. social services. especially as they affect the disadvantaged and underprivileged of our country. it is on those grounds that i shall vote in favor of confirmation.
the senator and i will have further quarrels on that score. there is an express provision of the law which is present in the general education provisions act. that all amounts appropriated shall be expended in the fiscal year for which appropriated. the administration says it is hoing this provisionand that is the colloquy with the new secretary of health. education. and welfare.  of the united states would expect that senators with convictions equal to his convictions would press them on the floor and try to arrive at some accommodation. in the tradition of legislation and law in this country. in order to do that. i do  see just going along on a nice. quiet monday with a continuing resolution until the end of the fiscal year. which leaves questions up in the air. the administration has decided they are going to set the priorities and  we. and they have already done that to some extent. this is the way they construe a continuing resolution even though i and all who have spoken on the issue think they are wrong and are defying the clear statements in the law. so i think we should seek to make appropriate amendments to this continuing resolution. so that we make clearer what is already clear. and we retain a reasonable amount of control as to how it is going to be interpreted.
well. that is technically correct. but that does  take into account the following points: one. the feelings and views of the people of the country. as expressed through us. and two. the fact that a president. and i believe certainly this president. will obey the law. the executive department. as set forth in the colloquy just had. already has said it will obey the law insofar as the general education provisions act which requires expenditures within the fiscal year is concerned. therefore. it seems to me we have an option. that option would be to incorporate in the continuing resolution the very same provision which is contained in the general education provisions law. then we will see if the administration which has interpreted that section to require expenditure as directed by law will extend the principle to other provisions covered by similar law. that is  the case . the administration does  agree they are up against a statutory obligation as in the general education provisions law in respect of these other programs. we feel they are and that would be one way in which we could proceed. aher way. if this is to be a struggle between the executive branch and congress. would be to extend everything only to april 30 and  to june 30. then. let us see how the country feels as this matter is debated. and as the bill of the senator from th carolina is considered by the committee on government operations and the committee on the judiciary. when i say we must find some way in which we can live together. i have in mind the traditional american process of debate which generally produces results. and i believe the president believes so. too. if i may lay this before the senator from new hampshire . who will give the presidents position or the position of hew. to be more accurate. i would propose consideration by the senate of two propositions: one. to shorten the period of extension. and that would cover the laborhew part of continuing resolution so that it is syymous with the april 30 date affixed for foreign aid. the alternative would be to fix our priorities and mandate expenditures as the administration says it will comply with such a mandate which is contained in one of the affected laws. to wit. the general education provisions act.
if i may reply to that. part of the expenditure of the department which is in issue is already covered by a provision of this character. second. having analyzed the individual itemsand these are the items which are before all members of the senatethere would be surprise in such a motion. as far as the senate is concerned. i do appreciate the views of the chairman of the appropriations committee. and i take them very. very seriously indeed. may i. therefore. ask the chairman the following question: what would be his attitude toward an amendment which would seek to limit the effect of this resolution to april 30. so we would at least have an opportunity to study through and articulate this point. without having a whole fiscal year go by without batting an eye. at the very least we ought to give ourselves a chance to stay. as the lawyers say. seized of the issue. what would be the senators attitude on that.
the difference between the senator and me is that the senator thinks i am impatient. i am extremely patient. or i would  go for extending it for a short period of time. but i believe the senate has to work its will on the issue of who is going to determine the priorities in this country. therefore it should keep its options open just as it did at the end of the last congress. this seems to me to be a persuasive reason for  going all the way with a continuing resolution until the end of the fiscal year. which seems to me is surrendering the fact that we can do anything about it and testifying to the allegation. which is made repeatedly. that when it comes to the crunch we are impotent. the senate will be able to decide whether it does or does  wish to keep these options open. that is the opportunity which the senate has at this time. in all fairness.
 and the members of the 93d congress pledging their cooperation and talents in helping to devise national policies in science and techogy for the greater and more rational utilization of our nations resources. the letter represents a most enlightened and constructive effort on the part of the engineering profession and is evidence of their public spiritedness and a sense of citizenship. i find it very instructive to learn from the engineering profession of their complete agreement with the desirability of establishing. in their words: nationally formulated series of goals and objectives for men. methods. and materials to maintain proper balance between supply and demand and to insure that all of our national priorities are being adequately met. the indispensability of establishing national goals and priorities in a systematic. longrange fashion. has. of course. been recognized by the senate in connection with s. 5. the full opportunity and national goals and priorities act.  pending before the senate labor and public welfare committee. this bill has had wide bipartisan cosponsorship during the last three congresses. and title ii of the bill. which i authored more than 4 years ago. establishes a congressional staff office of goals and priority analysis which will enable the congress to operate effectively with the executive branch as a coequal in policymaking and with adequate resources. these provisions were passed twice by the senate. in view of the current debate with the executive branch over the administrations efforts to reorder our national priorities through the impoundment of funds and the liquidation of agencies like the antipoverty agencies. and because of the growing recognition within the congress of the need to reform the congress own budget procedures so that there may be effective coordination of expenditures within the overall governmental program. the need to enact s. 5 into law becomes more evident with every passing day. i commend the joint engineering societies for their willingness to devote their very substantial talents and expertise to the government. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the open letter of the joint engineering societies be reprinted in the record at this point along with the text of my remarks before the joint engineering societies legislative forum.
 on february 20. 1973. urging him to submit revised and amended budgetary requests for fiscal year 1973 to meet these needs. in that letter. i was joined by 26 of my colleagues. mr. abourezk. mr. bible. mr.
 should(1) continue in operation the office of ecoic opportunity. administering and supervising the important programs and activities entrusted to that office under the provisions of the ecoic opportunity act of 1964. utilizing fully funds appropriated by the congress for such purposes. and (2) submit a revised budget request for the fiscal year ending june 30. 1974. requesting appropriations for the office of ecoic opportunity and its administration of programs and activities entrusted to it under and in accordance with the provisions of the ecoic opportunity act of 1964. at that time. i urged the administration to reconsider the policy by which it is proceeding. and halt the dismantling of oeo and rather to seek congressional approval under a reorganization plan of those plans it has for the components of the agency. last friday. march 1. the office of ecoic opportunity annced that it will put funding on a regular basis. beginning on that day. a press release issued march 1. 1973. by the office states as follows:
. the behavior of interest rates during the past few weeks is a good example of the difficulty we shall have during the critical months ahead as we approach the top of the business cycle. first and foremost i would like to commend the federal reserve chairman. dr. arthur burns. who also serves as the chairman of the committee on interest and dividends. for charting a secure course through the precarious issue of keeping interest rates in check. while continuing an appropriate monetary policy of moderate monetary expansion. he is just  in the way of making an extraordinary contribution to interest rate stability. what we have read in the papers is that interest rates have gone up. this rise. incidentally. had been foreseen by virtually all ecoic analysts. for it is clear that with our ecoy under a full head of steam. the demand for credit is  running headon with the need to keep the ecoy from going through the roof. but  we have a change and the structure of interest rates in the financial markets is beginning to demonstrate the effect of dr. burns committee on interest and dividends. for example. the commercial paper rate. which consistently runs below the prime rate. was quoted today at 6/8 percent to 7% percent. which is substantially higher than the 6 /2percent prime rate which is being posted by most major banks. as we have read. that 61/2percent rate is the direct result of dr. burns having convinced a number of major banks that they should go down from a 6%-percent prime rate level. but it is pretty clear that even the higher 7%-percent level is below what the prime rate would be if free market conditions were allowed to prevail. it would be politically tempting to advocate hard controls on interest rates. but the current experience shows how difficult and dangerous this could be. for the difficulty is that the money markets are auction markets. where the law of supply and demand reigns virtually supreme. controls simply do  apply to auction markets. the danger of imposing hard controls is that controlled rates would impose huge distortions in the credit markets. shifting their activity and much heavier competition for funds into the lowinterest rate sectors. we have already seen this happen with regard to the prime. which has attracted a disproportionate amount of borrowing out of commercial paper and into the banks themselves. also. when we are dealing with money. we are dealing with a subtle situation.  just in the local market but in the world market. which can be withheld without any great cost to the withholder but is terribly disruptive to bear. what is developing from this experience. as described in the wall street journal this morning. is an initiative by dr. bums to find ways in which increased pressure on interest rates will still keep debt costs for borrowers of moderate means down. while also keeping adequate flows of credit for those firms with access to national money markets. here dr. burns is breaking new ground. and the complexitiesboth political and ecoicof his task are emous. the goal. which i believe to be in his grasp. is an interest rate structure where mortgage. consumer. and other rates which apply to the man in the street will  feel the full heat of rising interest rates. this is as much as we should expect from an ecoy which must at all times maintain the delicate balance between public policy and private freedom. dr. burns deserves great credit for maintaining this balance as do those banks that have shown a patriotic spirit of cooperation during this difficult time. i believe that this approach to interest rate "control" will prove to be the most equitable and effective. and at any rate. far less injurious to the ecoy than the direct controls which have been proposed by some. i ask unanimous consent that an article about this situation in todays wall street journal be placed in the record.
. i sought the floor before. in order to make some brief remarks on the interest equalization tax and especially. as i have entertained the view for a long time and have expressed it time and time again. because the tax is a bad and ineffective way to approach our balanceofpayments difficulties. those difficulties have already proliferated. they are worse  than ever. the balance of payments which we have today is in worse shape than it was on the occasion of the extension in 1969. the interest rate disparities between the united states and other countries. ably the united kingdom. germany. italy. and others. is still so wide that we are caught in a box. there is very little we can do about it. even though this is a regressive tax. the important point which i should like to make is that in view of our unhappy balanceofpayments situation. it is very desirable to support considerable investment in the united states. that is what our government has generally pursued with a very constructive policy on that score. as i am heavily involved in many of these matters. in a public policy sense. i should like to ask the chairman of the finance committee if he would be kind egh to give me his attention and reply to one or two questions. there has been a great deal of feeling. especially in europe. that if the united states withholding tax on dividends and interest for foreigners were repealed. there would be an emous difference in terms of portfolio investment in the united states. at the present time. net foreign purchases of u.s. securities constitute one of the most favorable sectors in our international payments accounts. this suggests. however. that there is a substantial amount of investment which has been put off by the rather considerable "penalty" which the withholding provision represents. i should therefore like to ask the distinguished senator from louisiana whether the consideration of this matter has been or will be a subject of consideration by the finance committee. the issue is important at this time. because it is. perhaps. tailormade to the question whether we would really get an affirmative portion of foreign investment here. which otherwise we would  get. due to a phrasing in the law that way.
aher question i had for the senator was this: we have tried in a variety of ways to bring about a proposal by the treasury department of its own concepts for comprehensive reform of the internal revenue system. the socalled tax loophole business. it may be recalled that last year an amendment which i had tried on that score was headed off. as it were. by a commitment from the treasury department that it would submit such a plan. . so far as i can see. withstanding a lot of followup. hing like that has happened. does the senator still believe that that is desirable. i certainly do think it is. that we should do something and try to get that out of the administration even though we failed the last time on a kind of gentlemens agreement basis.
i thank my colleague very much. that is very reassuring. i gathered as a corollary to that that the senator and the committee. at least a majority on the committee. join in the strong feeling that the concepts of a comprehensive tax reform proposal should. in the first instance. come from the administration itself.
i thank my colleague very much. and ask unanimous consent that a copy of my correspondence with secretary of the treasury shultz. on -the subject of tax reform. together with other documents useful for developing a legislative history on the subject. be inserted in the record.
. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record my letter to the hoable jamie l. whitten and al ullman. cochairmen of the joint study committee on budget control. on the subject of reforming the congressional budget process.
s 1974 budget request. the original cost estimates for operating the committee. when enacted in june of 1971. was based on little actual funding experience. since the estimates were developed it has been found that an increase of $40.000 is needed in view of recent pay increases. unexpected space rental costs. and higher than expected postage costs. the proposed changes would permit the agency to carry out the duties and functions charged by the congress so the blind and other severely handicapped will have enhanced opportunities to become self supporting.
. the senator may recall that i had a similar amendment and that the administration assured us that a report would be out. for one reason or aher it was  the senator may recall that we were also due to get a similar report at the end of the year. there was a big crisis involved then. and they did  submit it at that time. the purpose of the senate being so clear and the senator from louisiana being sympathetic to that purpose. would it be proper for the senator to spread his interpretation of this matter on the record to the effect that this be done by april 30 and that if it is  done in the house ways and means committee. it will be done in the senate finance committee. the senate is entitled to get its presentation of this tax package within this time.
. i understand that perfectly. my point is that. as on two previous occasions our hopes have been dashed in that regard. would the senator from louisiana assure the senate that he. too. has a very important committee. and that while he can in his committee initiate tax reform. he certainly has the right to ask the administration to keep its promise. if this hope fails over there. i would like to k whether the senator thinks that it should fail here in view of the declared intention of the senate.
 this year. the authorization is $2.600.250.000. a reduction of $881.250.000. that is a 25percent reduction. furthermore. the authorization for fiscal year 1973 in s. 7 is almost $100 million less than the authorizations  in law for fiscal year 1971 and fiscal year 1972-$1.01 billion each. fourth. this is  a partisan issue. since its enactment in 1920 and through its major expansions in 1943. 1954 and 1960 it has enjoyed great bipartisan support. s. 7 passed the senate only a few weeks ago on february 28 by a vote of 86 to 2. consistent with this overwhelming bipartisan support. the vocational rehabilitation organizations. in urging support for an override have stressed the bipartisan aspects of this measure. the leadership in the house and senate in the effort to override is shared by both republicans and democrats. in the house committee on education and labor. there was only one vote for the administration substitute. the bill was reported 36 to 1 and passed the house 318 to 57. in the senate committee on labor and public welfare. the bill was reported unanimously. with my cosponsorship as the ranking miity member of the full committee and with the cosponsorship of the ranking miity member of the subcommittee on the handicapped
. i introduce for appropriate reference the community service educational benefits act. this measure is along the lines of the recent hew task force recommendation for a gi bill for community service. this idea was also advanced by former hew secretary defense secretaryelliot richardson in a june 3. 1972. speech at wittier college. and the following month at the university of connecticut. at which time he suggested a gi bill for community services which would encourage assistance to communities by providing additional benefits to those who participated in selected community projects. it offers young people an opportunity to earn educational benefits. similar to that afforded veterans. on the basis of their community service. and recognizes that community service is also service to country. while in recent years. over 160.000 young people have participated in federal volunteer programs. many more are neededa survey referred to by the hew task force estimates a potential of 200.000 immediate volunteer opportunities. under the bill. young people who have served since january 1. 1973. for at least 6 months in eligible community services programs at a salary higher than that received by an army sergeant-$311 monthlycould receive educational benefits. for each month of eligible community service. the recipient would receive 1 month of educational benefits at half the rate provided for veterans under the gi billthey would get $110 monthlyfor up to 2 years. eligible programs include such federally supported activities as the peace corps. the youth conservation corps. and vista. eligible federal programs would be designated by the community services educational benefits board established by the bill. they would include. it is anticipated. such state activities as the california ecology corps and the th carolina internship program. as well as other federal programs which have operated successfully for at least a year and meet such published standards as the director of action. with the advice of the community services educational benefits board. may prescribe. this legislation would encourage young people to engage in community service. helping them balance their formal education with constructive community service experience. and helping provide manpower for worthy community service projects. the bill also reflects the feeling that. while such community service at modest pay does  equal service in the armed forces in terms of dislocation and personal risk. it nevertheless is so desirable in the national interest and should receive recognition and encouragement. as secretary richardson statedwe need to reopen the question this country debated briefly a decade agothe question of how to provide new challenges for the thousands of young people whose idealism has  yet soured. we would all agree. i believe. with that marvelous statement of william james that what we need to solve our problems is something like "the moral equivalent of war." but to develop this spirit. we need something like the moral equivalent to basic training. is there a way to structure opportunities for the young to test themselves on adversaries such as pollution. crime. drugs. and poverty. are there meaningful moral equivalents for basic training which could be accessible to individuals with a wide range of talents. to women as well as men. why  create a new kind of "gi bill"--a "gi bill" for community service. surely service in the community is as valuable to our country as militaryservice. and more rewarding to the individuals concerned. the bill authorizes assistance to 10.000 eligible students during the 1974 fiscal year. 25.000 during each of fiscal year 1975 and fiscal year 1976. and 100.000 for each fiscal year thereafter. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record as part of my remarks the full text of the report of the hew task force to which i referred. from the march 12 issue of the chronicle for higher education. together with the bill.
. that senator johnston will join with us. after properly waiting to consider what occurs in his hearings. in seeking to establish this commission on a very much stronger basis than it has been. and also in seeing that it gets to work. because i k of single more important problem facing our country than the productivity problem. the distinguished senator from louisiana has. i believe. been likeminded in wanting to get positive action out of the productivity commission. and so this amendment is offered in the same spirit of cooperation which he has shown in recognizing. ansl dealing with. this important issue.
i realize we have made many efforts to get a tax reform package from the administration. i realize the administration is going to present its package but i do  see how they would preempt the necessity for highlevel expertise with respect to what we should do. the matter is so important we should establish a commission such as the hoover commission. and that is the way my commission is constituted. to report to us the most desirable aspects of reform in order that we might have very authoritative and broadbased legislation. for myself. i think it is the most practical of all the plans that have been put forward. it does  attempt to anticipate anything. it attempts to get a truly professional result. i hope to get early action on this matter. by mr. javits:
. i mentioned when i made my remarks in chief that this country. for years and years and years. has lagged behind all the other major countries of the world. the fact is that even after we enact this particular bill and make the authorizations which we have provided for in this particular measure. we will still be dealing with 70 cents per person in fiscal 1975. and $1 per person in fiscal 1976 in terms of national stimulation of the arts. canada. a nation much like our own but with less material per capita annual income than ours. spends $1.40 annually per person. west germany spends $2 per person. sweden spends $2 per person. austria spends $2 per person. and so forth. many countries in the third world. the socalled developing countries. do better than we do. the maximum under these authorizations. which are characterized as being so profligate. will come to $1 per person per endowment in 1976.
s sayso. they must persuade the congress to give its concurrence. that is the wisdom and the safeguard of our constitution. what we seek to assert. therefore. is a rule of law. and  a rule of men. that. i think. in terms of the american people and their future and their freedom. is a most important question for us to decide. far greater than any other question which has been raised here today. finally. as to the senate rules. yes. i think. a point of order will lie. but i think also the amendment is directly germane. because the courts have held that if we pass an appropriation. if we refrain from cutting off money. it may be an indication that we approve or authorize what is being done. in view of the short timespan involved. from  until the end of the fiscal year. how are we going to manifest our intention except in an appropriation bill. therefore. i shall vote to sustain the point of germaneness. that is what the vote is going to be
. i must vote against the kennedy amendment because one of its principal effects is to allow high salaried executives to use the large amount of regular taxes they pay as an offset against income they receive from tax loopholes. since the rationale for the minimum tax was to avoid situations vhere some very high income persons were able to avoid taxes or pay very low taxes. it seems odd that persons who do pay a "large amount of regular taxes" should be depicted as in some way unpatriotic. my particular preference. on the other hand. would be to raise from 10 to 20 percent the rate on income from tax preferences. this would get at the person who actually pays little or taxes in a way that the kennedy amendment does . under existing law. what we have is a minimum tax provision which is intended to be what the name implies: if people are  paying a regular tax. or are paying a low tax. they must pay a minimum of 10 percent on their tax preference income. under the kennedy amendment however. you could have persons paying large regular taxes plus the preference tax. in addition. the amendment would  affect rich persons paying taxes. in other words. the whole character of the minimum tax provision would change under the present amendment. and would become a fiat 10percent tax on the gross amount of preferences. in addition to all regular taxes paid. if congress wants to levy a charge on preference income it should do so directly rather than by the backdoor way being proposed by the present amendment.
. . a word or two of further explanation. the number of workers involved is approximately 30.000 each week who are exhausting their regular benefits. the total number of workers that we estimate could be assisted between  and june 30. 1974. exceeds 1.100.000. every member has been given a letter addressed to him which specifies the states involved during fiscal year 1974. and i ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the record.
exactly right. in addition. if senators can justify social security amendments on the debt ceiling bill. they certainly can justify this amendment on the debt ceiling bill. and i hope the senate will adopt the amendment.
yes. the reason is this. welfare is paid by state and federal governments out of general revenue. it is a grant. unemployment compensation is raised by taxation on employers. which is taxation on the individual employer. so there is a greater mutuality and less government drain.
the difference is the source of payment. it is  general tax money. it is money raised from specific employers as an element of the fact that they are in business. those are the facts. i can make the facts any different to prove what the senator from arkansas wants me to prove. he wants the facts. i am giving him the facts.
. i ask unanimous consent that there be included at this point in my remarks a chart utilizing data provided by the u.s. office of education indicating how the states are affected by the holdharmless provision in the fiscal year 1974 laborhew appropriations bill approved by the house and  pending before the senate committee on appropriations.
this is a bill whose time has come because of inflation and because of the basic requirements of our society. i hope very much for these reasons and for other reasons which we will advance as the debate continues. that the pending substitute will be rejected.
. this amendment was worked out with the miity staff of the committee and is satisfactory to me. i think it does what needs to be done. i concur with senator nelson about the fact that our approach to amendment  414. which is of substantive character. is more desirable within the context of next year. especially. as we said yesterday in a related bill. because we are trying to work out a total package with the administration to take us by this particular period. which is a period of budget stringency. considerable difficulty for the dollar. and so forth. we believe that we have an excellent chance to do that. it would make it more difficult if we took a substantive amendment such as amendment  414. i believe senator hathaway is being statesmanlike and constructive in refraining from pushing that amendment under these circumstances. of which helike senator nelson. senator taft. and iis well aware.
. i invite attention to s. 1693. also pending before our committee. which is called the full employment and job development act of 1974. in which an effort is made to institutionalize the policy of full employment and thus the ability to respond precisely to such information and development as the secretary would be obligated to inform us of by the amendment. again. i hope we will examine  only the highly desirable solutions which senator hathaway lays before us in respect to the real problem but also the institutionalization. whether through the technique suggested in s. 1693 or otherwise. of the ability to meet this kind of problem.
yes. the comment would have to be both plus and minus. let me first give the plus. there is question about the fact that public service employment will have been aided by general revenue sharing. because governments have to hire people. and so forth. on the other hand. it will  necessarily be focused on the ecoically disadvantaged or other groups in need. on the contrary. the record indicates that when the community is hiring. de o as it were. there is more likely to be a concentration on skills. and so forth. second. t he two go together. in that. because of general revenue sharing. there are more slots open as general jobs in the public service field. the public employment program participant goes in because he is uideremployed under the program and he then kind of graduates when he has some skill and may go into a job which may be made available because of general revenue sharing. so the senator is right that there is a relationship but it is  one of a substitution.
. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed at this point in the record a letter which senator hughes and i wrote to the senator from new mexico respecting the effort to provide the full budget estimate for this particular item.
i thoroughly agree with the senator. but i am going to raise this question. so that he might have it in mind in conference. i might say that i shall withdraw the amendment when i have finished. i am told that because of the financing of this fund in a supplemental for fiscal year 1973. carryover funds can be used. of course. congress can always take care of that by providing the necessary relief. but i believe that with the disposition of the senator who has just spoken. the distinguished senator from new mexico -and if he will bear this point in mind. which may or may  be followed in the conferencei have every confidence that so far as money is deserved. it will be forthcoming. i thank the senator. i withdraw the amendment.
. on june 29th. as the senate was engaged in the l1th hour consideration of the continuing resolution to provide funds for federal programs for the new fiscal year beginning july lst. i spoke with reference to the socalled holdharmless provision contained in that bill.  public law 9352. and also contained in the housepassed fiscal year 1974 appropriations bill. h.r. 8877. that proviso stipulates that state will receive less under title ia of the elementary and secondary education acteseathan it received during fiscal year 1972. at that time i pointed out that. as confirmed by the u.s. office of education. the provision would  prevent local school districts disadvantaged by the 1970 census from a precipitous loss of grant funds. as the house sponsors had argued. and would. as a matter of fact. result in a windfall for a limited number of school districts in 21 states at the expense of all school districts in 29 states. i pointed out that if we wished to cushion local school districts against a precipitous loss in title i funds because of changes brought about by use of the 1970 census instead of the outdated 1960 censusand i. for one. would want to do thatthe holdharmless provision should be modified to apply to the local educational agenciescomputed by countiesat 80 percent of the 1973 level. there was opportunity at the time of my june 29th remarks to modify the holdharmless clause in the continuing resolution as it was necessary to adopt the funding measure before the 1973 fiscal year expired the next day on june 30th. however. the congress will have an opportunity to restore equity to title i funding in the laborhew appropriation bill presently pending in committee and in the next continuing resolution which must be enacted before the end of this month. since i last spoke on this subject. a number of questions have arisen concerning the equity of the holdharmless proviso. even from those who previously advocated its inclusion in the appropriations language. first. it is becoming increasingly apparent that the design of the hold harmless provision is contrary to the very intent of its designers. as it is  being applied to the first quarter allocations of fiscal year 1974 it is obvious that although it is holding some states at their fiscal year 1972 levels. it is  in fact accomplishing its purpose of preventing dislocations of local budgetary processeseven in the beneficiary states. the reason is that the esea statute obliges the office of education to allocate title i funds at the county level. thus. in determining a countys share. a loss in eligible students under the 1970 census automatically renders a loss in title i funds for that county. even though a state as a whole may be receiving the same amount it received in fiscal year 1972. there may still be counties within the state receiving less than received in fiscal year 1972or in fiscal year 1973. thus. some counties in beneficiary states get richer. others in the same state stay just as poor. and counties in gaining states lose even more than they would without the proviso. second. the 100percentholdharmless provision creates inequitable variations in the amount of funds allocated to different parts of the country. for example. south carolina would receive $438 per title i pupilagainst $211 if there were 100percentholdharmless provisionwhile five other statescalifornia. colorado. indiana. ohio. and utahwould be receiving only $170 per title i pupileach would get between $208 and $210 in the absence of the 100 percent hold harmless. can we realistically expect that these five states can accomplish the same goals at $170 per title i pupil as south carolina can accomplish with several times as much at $438. especially when one considers the higher costs in california. colorado. indiana. ohio. and utah. equally inequitable is the pupilteacher ratio. if one divides the state average teachers salary into the money available to local educational agencies and then divides the result into the count of title i children. it will be shown that the number of teachers per 100 title i children ranges from a high of 6.3 in mississippi to a low of 1.4 in california. while i do  argue that every states ratio should be identical. i do contend that a spread of 41/2 to 1 shows that correction is needed. also. with the 100 percent 1972 level state hold harmless provision some states receive almost 90 percent of their state average per pupil expenditure. while 14 states are receiving less than 20 percent of their state average per pupil expenditure. furthermore. the .state receiving the highest percentage of its average per pupil expenditure receives over 25 percent of its revenue for public elementary and secondary education from federal funds. at the same time. some of those states receiving the lowest percentage of their average per pupil expenditure receive about 3 percent of their revenue for public elementary and secondary education from federal funds. there are those who contend that the present title i formula is inadequate to national or local needs and that other provisions of esea. including title i. should be changed. many of these arguments have a firm foundation. that is why the subcommittee on education has been conductingand continues to conducthearings on the elementary and secondary education act. the way to change title i and other elements of esea is through the deliberative process in committee and on the floor in the authorizing legislation and  appreciably to alter the program through hastily debated "hold harmless" and "grandfather" provisos in the appropriation bill. in fiscal year 1966. the first year of its operation. congress appropriated $959 million for title i. we are  considering an appropriation of nearly twice that amount. $1.81 billion. title i has enjoyed this congressional support because. withstanding its shortcomings. it has done a credible job in educating the disadvantaged in all parts of the nation. communities in one state enjoying its benefits with reasonable equity with other communities in other states. i hope that this broad base of support will  be endangered by uniquely devised provisos in appropriation measures which alter the direction of the flow of funds from that contemplated in the authorizing legislation. changes should be madefew argue to the contrarybut such changes should be reasonable and made with care and deliberation. the 100 percent hold harmless is discriminatory and unreasonable. i ask unanimous consent that there be included at this point in my remarks a table illustrating points which i have made:
. i introduce an amendment to s. 1541. the budget reform bill. relating to tax expenditures. my amendment provides that the revenue effects of tax expenditures such as those enumerated in the publication by the house ways and means committee entitled "estimates of federal tax expenditures" be reviewed by the appropriate committees and the congress in the consideration of budget ceilings. i believe we can have a meaningful debate on government spending without some consideration of indirect spending by way of the tax system. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record.
. this is a technical amendment to section 17 of the asian development bank act. it strikes out a requirement calling for two installments. one of $40.000.000 and one of $60.000.000. in fiscal years 1972 and 1973 for the special fund of the bank and substitutes a single installment of $100 million. these are two installments already which provide for an aggregate of $100 million. these were originally enacted on march 10. 1972. as part of a comprehensive bill making authorization for special funds in respect to the number of international financing agencies. i believe it was the intent of the congress in enacting this particular section that the two installments did  have to be appropriated in a particular fiscal year. but could be expended without fiscal year limitations. we are  in fiscal year 1974 and congress has  yet taken affirmative action on the administration request for these funds. i do  believe the fact that we have  acted should affect the authorization. this technical amendment will remove any question that the total of $100 million is authorizedthat is. the $40 million and the $60 million. it would continue. subject to appropriation. if we decided to appropriate it. but at least it will  be susceptible to a point of order that there is authorization. i should point out that it does  involve the authorization of any additional funds. i urge the adoption of the amendment.
. this amendment provides a workable way for congress to undertake its examination of the needs and program alternatives. and the allocation of limited dollars to diverse human needs. it will establish a means for a responsible and disciplined execution by congress of its responsibilities in the budget policy field. it will allow congress to acquire the means for the gathering of interpretive and analytical data on spending and related program matters. most importantly. it will facilitate the use of objective expenditures analyses to help it form independent judgments on appropriations matters. i trust that some of the solutions which will begin to resolve these problems are found in this amendment.
. i have had printed in table a the record a tabulation which is found on page 32504 in this mornings record. a reprint of which is on everyones desk. i include in my remarks at this point tables based upon an appropriation of roughly $1.8 billion for title i of the esea. and with 100 percent of the hold harmless provision at the 1972 level. which is the first column. then the second table compares that with what would happen in fiscal year 1974. that is. in fiscal year 1974 if we applied this particular formula. this would be the result. also we analyze what happens with an 85percent hold harmless provision which shows that a majority of the states do better than they would with a 100percent hold harmless provision. i ask unanimous consent to have two tables printed in the record.
that is true. the formula is set by the federal government. really it is academic to argue about the laborhew appropriation bill. we do  k whether it will pass. it is  here. our very distinguished colleague the senator from new hampshire will be handling it on this side. we have a record of veto in respect to it. that was one of my arguments for the quie amendment: at least there is egh of a chance that we will  have the hew appropriations bill to repair to. but will be bound by this continuing resolution until the end of the current fiscal year. that we have to give it the kind of finite attention which we mally do  give to a short extension on a continuing resolution. that is why i am here arguing against this committee amendment which deletes the quie amendment.
it can do anything with the additional. because it is hing but a passthrough agency. it simply adds to the rigidity to confine the 90110 to the state. the other point. which i think is important is the laborhew appropriation bill of the senator from washingtonwe all ho him. he is one of the most loved senators on this flooris that we k that even his bill may take awhile before it is enacted. but let us assume that it will move fairly quickly. even with this struggle. which we will resolve somehow. then we will have the problem of a veto of an hew bill. if it is vetoed. the presidents lawyerswe had this fight with them last yearhold that where a bill is vetoed. it wipes out both the house and -the senate bills. and then we go back to the continuing resolution. just perpetuating the inequity. so we are in a position where we have to try to protect ourselves in the continuing resolution. which may very well remain the law until the end of the fiscal year.
all right. should  the senators amendment be amended to make it fiscal 1973. i will give the senator the reason for that question. we understandand this includes my own state and may include many other statesthat many local educational agencies. could lose more than 10 percent because the standard adopted is the fiscal year 1972 instead of the fiscal year 1973. so if we are going to go for a ceiling and a floor. let us at least go for the ceiling and the floor for the last actual year. which is fiscal year 1973. may i k from the senator why he does  do that.
the senate voted with him and followed his point of view. we have a somewhat different situation here. the 100 percent holdharmless applies to the states. yesterday. we unraveledand the senator and others were kind egh to say that i helped with the semantics so that everybody could understand what this was aboutbut we unraveled the problem relating to the states and the local educational agencies. yesterday. we made a very important shift. we  only gave a hold harmless provision for the states. but we gave a hold harmless provision for the local educational agencies. yesterday we also made aher change in this and out a ceiling on. what i am saying . therefore. is that as we have changed the direction and with the same amount of moneythere is difference in the moneybut in order to make the thing as fair as possible. having changed direction for the first time. we also admitted the local educational agencies. i believe it would be desirable and wise to go to the 1973 standard. we are changing anyhow. we are accepting a totally new principle. if we are going to go for a new principle. why arbitrarily apply that principle to a population base. and so forth. which is for a fiscal year preceding the last one. why do we  go to the preceding fiscal year.
may i say to my friend and colleague that i am going to go with him. because i think that is the temper of the senate. i do  agree. but that is neither here  there. i ask him this. as an honest man and as a fine senator: will he study this question. it will be in conference. because the house has aher standard. will the senator study carefully this question of 197273. for this reason: my staff. which is on the substantive legislative side. informs me that some districts. some local educational agencies. may lose more than 10 percent because of this use of fiscal year 1972. all i ask the senator from new hampshire and the senator from washington is to look it over carefully from that point of view. i do  think we can settle it . because i am sure the senators will have the best figures they can get. all i ask the managers of the bill is to look it over carefully. to see whether. by making it 1973. more equity would be done.
s power. but he is a deep constitutionalist. according to his own tradition and his illustrious reputation. i can testify egh to the impact which his support of this measure has had. i consider it decisive in bringing us to where we are today and to the debt of gratitude which he earns from the country.
. on september 18. a young and dedicated public servant lost his battle for life against a long and painful illness. tom vail. chief counsel of the senate finance committee. will be sorely missed both by the members of the senate and the nation. we have all benefited from his expertise and kledge gained in the 22 years since he first served on the joint internal revenue taxation committee in 1951. his vast understanding of the intricacies of complicated tax matters. together with administrative ability which enabled him to assemble one of the most competent and cooperative staffs in the congress. was instrumental in drafting and guiding the crucial tax legislation of the 1960s through the congress. never was this more evident than during the long and tedious debate on the tax reform act of 1969 when his capabilities and those of the committee were equally accessible to committee members and committee members alike. it is. of course. always tragic when one so young loses his life and we can only hope that his family and friends will take consolation and pride from his extraordinary contributions to his country during his all too short lifetime. mrs. javits joins me in extending our profound condolences to mrs. vail and the vail children. nasa
. i wish to associate myself with one thing the senator said that came out in testimony before the committee on government operations this morning by mr. ash. the budget director. there is nc reason whatever for panic. mr. ash testified there is reason for panic. we do  have to have a recession. the degree to which our ecoy may abate is likely to be minimal. provided we keep our shirts on. obey a reasonable discipline. and go through with the measures we have espoused. i hope that all members who have prestige in their states would so assure the people of their states. because i think the psychological factor that we have to have a recession. that this is going to be a tremendous ecoic jolt. that we somehow are going to suffer unkn difficulties because of it. is becoming so prevalent that it may induce exactly what need  happen. i thank the senator very much for speaking as he has.
s budget. which i am assured by the department will be there in january. for the $2.287.000. and that thereby the senates position would be strengthened. if there is a budget estimate. the facts are that as of january 1. 1974. the united states will be in arrears for the last quarter of calendar year 1973. in the second supplemental. on july 1. 1973. $8.700.000 was provided. this. with the $6.422.000 contained in the regular fiscal year appropriation. totaled $15.122.000. the department feels that the delay of a few months in the payment of the $2.287.000 is preferable. although naturally it is  the optimum. to running the risk of putting it in in the senate. without having a budget estimate. and facing difficulties with the other body. for the information of senators. i hope all will remember that the ilo is a tripartite international organization that has been functioning for 50 years. consisting of labor. management. and government. that it is one of the longest standing. most durable. and most useful international organizations. it deals with the feeling which so many of us have about international competition. and the urgency to raise.  only on humane grounds and development grounds but on competitive grounds. the labor standards in other countries.
 the conference report on s. 1559. the "comprehensive employment and training act of 1973." which act contains a "such sums" authorization for fiscal year 1974 and a special authority to which i contributed to authorize the secretary to provide financial assistance for the summer job program. essentially through the neighborhood youth corps program. for this summer from appropriations available under the act. accordingly when s. 1559 becomes law. as i expect it will shortly. the secretary will have both the necessary authorization and appropriations which may be run through the new authorityas he may under the continuing appropriation itselfto carry out his responsibility with respect to the maintenance of the neighborhood youth corps summer job program for this summer. i ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from page 41043 of the record of december 12. 1973. together with excerpts from the conference report on s. 1559. including statements from the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference. be printed in the record at this time.
. i understand completely the arguments alread3 made in respect of enduse rationing allocation. new exploration. control of exports. unemployment assistance. franchise dealers. and so forth. and the disadvantages of the diminution of environmental protection. that brings the senator from wisconsin to bring this motion. additionally. i have followed the arguments in respect of section 110. the renegotiation or windfall tax provision. i think that renegotiation provision is bad. i believe it will be found invalid because of its indefiniteness. however. i believe it will be dealt with in an excess profits tax which we will be considering promptly. well before this provision takes effect. there is liability until the board actually acts. in other words. there is right of action until the renegotiation board acts. so ody will be prejudiced by that section if it gets wiped out in an excess profits tax provision. what this conference report means is that it is of importance in trying to get an end to the oil embargo. it is my considered judgment that unless we act by adopting the reportand i shall vote against recommittal and for the report for this principal reasonwe will  have served ice upon the arab states that the united states intends to make itself strong and well nigh invulnerable in terms of its petroleum product consumption within very short order. and therefore that it is in an excellent position to lead. in respect of western europe and japan. in an effort to coordinate their policies with ours. because it is the breakdown in that coordination which has put the world in such a disarray as to endanger all mankind.
. i support h.r. 12253 which was reported unanimously from the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am the ranking miity member. as has been pointed out. this bill has two sections. the first of these sections extends the authority of the carryover provision in the general education provisions actthe socalled tydings amendment provision--so that education funds appropriated for fiscal year 1974 will remain available during fiscal year 1975 and that fiscal year 1973 funds which were impounded and released during the current fiscal year will also remain available for expenditure during next year. this carryover language. first enacted in 1968 and expiring on june 30. 1974. is much needed by state and local educational agencies and should be extended so that they may plan and enter into contracts at this time and  be under undue pressures to spend all their federal funds by the june 30 deadline. both new york state and local educational agencies in new york strongly support this provision. section 2 of the bill would clarify congressional intent concerning the guaranteed loan program contained in title iv of the higher education act by eliminating the reference to need for
. our present problem is inflation. the problem these gentlemen speak of. of discovering more oil. is a very real one. but it is much longer range than the immediate grave danger of inflation and equality of supply. because i think this bill seeks to strike a blow affirmatively in those two respects. i shall vote for the conference report.
. that does  inhibit me and i think i would  enjoy that support if i were inhibited from dealing with these issues as they need to be dealt with in the total interest of all americans. including the up to 20 million americans in organized trade unions. in their interest i think we would literally outrage the person who goes to the grocery store these days and people who buy anything as consumers. if we  only dismantle any controls we have but also the mechanisms to reinstitute them. there is ample latitude to phase in decontrols. to ease up. and put something on a premium basis. items where production may be stimulated. but in many cases. there is a limitation of facilities. in many cases there is a removal of will to produce any more. and many other factors. including consumer attractiveness. i subscribe to the view that increased supply will have a profound and antiinflationary influence. indeed. the whole emphasis of our program must be directed to that end. but that does  mean that a great deal can be done with controls that are available. by the way the price mechanism is handled. especially the phasein. going in or going out of controls. as needed. we would leave ourselves defenseless in the critical state of the ecoical condition of this country and the world. with a very grave continuing danger of inflation if we strilped ourselves of the power of controls. whatever there is to the buckley argument. and the argument of his colleagues. ody is god. and can pretend the last element of judgment. but whatever there is to their argument surely. we may be sacrificing something in the initiative or stimulus to increase production. or something in the ultimate bulge which always comes when controls are taken off. these are tradeoffs and we must be realistic. but compare that with the real possibility of showing ourselves incapable of dealing with so eroding a force in terms of our ecoy as inflation. which is still galloping very successfully. withstanding our best efforts. if we strip ourselves of the power to control. let alone the controls themselves. we must come down heavily on the side of continuing the mechanism. i k that it expires april 30. inasmuch as i am against the policy they advocate i hope we will either defeat or table the amendment.
i should like to suggest one thing to both my colleagues. this discussion so far has proceeded in a very onedimensional way: should we have controls or should ive . but one has tried to evaluate what could have happened to our situation if we had  had any controls. one has made any estimate of that. it seems to me that that bears upon the question very seriously. yes. we have had a very serious inflation and a very serious budget deficit situattn. but even more important on the bulget deficit is that president johnson swept the vietnamese war under the rug for years. there were controls of any kind. whether on wages. prices. budgets. expenditures. or the use of gasoline or anything else on taxation. on the contrary. we reduced taxation by approximately $14 billionan unbelievable act which i voted against. for all the good that does me or anybody else in this country. i think this is a very fruitful discussion. it is the key element in the country today. withstanding the excitement about watergate. this is it with the individual citizen. i do  wish to denigrate the other. but this is the key point. i think we have to adjudge what would happen without the controls. what concerns meand i hope the senators will address themselves to this in the debateis that in view of the effect which inflation has at this point. i just see it blowing up all over and absolutely destroying faith in money if we simply leave ourselves defenseless. i am  arguing about decontrol of this. that. or the other. because that will happen. it is bound to happen. it seems to be the common view that it should. thus giving the ecoy a chance to go forward. but. on the overall. whether the inhibition should be on a businessman  to raise his price too much because of a historic base or whether there should be reinstitution of controls and the runaway situation i seethe senator. of course. differs with meif we lift all controls over power to reimpose them. i certainly would choose the former.
. this is obviously an appealing amendment. it raises the minimum wage in the third year. and one would think. why . but. as we have argued. it is a part of the package of the senator from colorado. the reason why and i join senator williams in opposition to the amendmentis that our times are simply too uncertain. in terms of the inflation and the cost of living today. to make that decision . it may be unfair. it may be excessive. or it may be way under what is needed. probably the latter. therefore. to lock ourselves in. or to lock the american working people in at this stage does  seem to me to be provident. as i say. superficially it is attractive. it is 10 cents an hour more. but it is 3 years from  and. in the present situation. in my judgment. as in the judgment of the senator from new jersey
also i believe that the top officials of the executive and legislative branches have a fair case for the increase recommended by the presidents commission. there has  been a pay adjustment for these people in 5 years when the consumer price index has risen 29.5 percent. in addition the salaries in private enterprise have risen from 25 to 30 percent for comparable jobs. the recommendation of the presidents commission are consistent with cost of living guidelines and are necessary if the federal government is to continue to attract and keep top talent. this is certainly money well spent and i do  believe it would be wise to further defer these increases.
. the committee on government operations reported this measure dealing with national goals and priorities. in a separate bill sponsored by the senator from florida . that bill. s. 1414. which i strongly support and cosponsored would provide the congress with critically important budget information which it does   get in a timely and useful manner. so the amendment which i shall call up tomorrow i send to the desk for printing under the rules. on behalf of myself and senators chiles. humphrey. mondale. muskie. johnson and mosscarries out that idea. i submit it to the managers. i hope they will consider it favorably.
. item 4 in this amendment was suggested by senator humphrey. who proposed. in the judgment of all of us who are cosponsors. a most important idea tying into the development of the national goals and priorities report. an assessment of the potential for balanced growth and ecoic development of the nation and what it requires in the larger context of budget planning. the work of the senator from florida
as the report shows. tax expenditures amounted to approximately $60 billion for the covered period and it indicates that a substantial amount of government subsidies are granted through the tax system rather than through the budget of the united states. these "tax expenditures" involve among other things exclusion of items from income and consequent reduction in tax liability from the exclusion. examples are social security retirement benefits being excluded from earnings. exclusion of earnings from pension plans and the exclusion of interest on state or local government obligations. by discussing these exclusions from income. i am  in any way indicating that there is necessarily anything wrong with any particular benefit. in fact. most provisions in the tax law represent the considered judgment of the government to grant a particular subsidy to a particular class of individuals or corporations who avail themselves of the benefit. however. there has never been any real connection made between the tax expenditures and direct budget outlays. the eminent legal scholar prof. stanley smrey of the harvard law school has been much concerned with this subject and testified in detail on the matter before the select committee on committees of the house of representatives. i ask unanimous consent that his testimony be included in the record at this point.
because of my continuing interest and concern in the matter of indirect spending by way of tax expenditures i proposed amendments to s. 1541 in the government operations committee that sought to include the concept of tax expenditures in the budget process as specified by that bill. my amendments were accepted by the committee and have been only slightly modified by the rules committee in the existing version of the bill. the purpose of the tax expenditure language in the present bill is to provide that tax expenditures shall be considered at each step of the budget process to measure their impact on budget authority and outlays. their effects on revenue and their general operations in the budget process. if this information is placed clearly before the congress. spending decisions will be made on a more informed basis than they have been in the past. it is essential that any contemplated changes in revenues through tax expenditures should be brought to the attention of the congress during the debate on the congressional budget. therefore. the report accompanying the concurrent resolution shall contain a list of the estimated levels of tax expenditures by major functional categories. most importantly in the case of legislation proposing new or increased tax expenditures the revenue committees of each house are charged with the duty of maintaining the appropriate levels of revenues and tax expenditures as set forth in the report accompanying the budget resolution or these committees must justify any deviation from those levels. while new or increased tax expenditures are  prohibited. the revenue committees will have the burden of justifying any changes and this should lead to a closer examination and more thorough debate of tax expenditures. the provisions of the pending bill. s. 1541. regarding tax expenditures are practically identical with the provisions of the government operations committee version of the bill with the major change being that the list of tax expenditures is  in the report accompanying the concurrent resolution rather than being in the resolution itself. for purposes clearly of spelling out what is meant by the tax expenditure provisions in the bill. i ask unanimous consent that the appropriate parts of the report of the committee on government operations accompanying s. 1541 be printed at this point in the record.
the report will accurately detail the operation of the tax expenditure concept except as i previously indicated for the inclusion of tax expenditures in the concurrent resolution. it should also be pointed out that in the discussion of estimated revenues and their sources it is also appropriate to discuss tax expenditures as they bear directly on revenues raised through the tax system and any changes therein may have the result of increasing or decreasing estimated revenues. finally i would like to reiterate that it is extremely important to consider indirect outlays by way of tax expenditures in the general debate on the budget and also at such times as the congress is considering tax legislation. if we do this. decisions made in this area will be on a more informed basis than ever before and will be coordinated to a much greater degree with our direct spending through the budget process. . this legislation provides a workable way for congress to undertake its examination of the needs and program alternatives. and the allocation of revenues to diverse human and national needs. it will establish a means for more responsible and disciplined execution by congress to its responsibilities in the budgetpolicymaking fields. it will allow congress to acquire the cxx- 84part 6 means for the gathering of interpretive and analytical data on spending and related programs. most importantly. it will facilitate the use of objective expenditures analyses to help it form independent judgments on appropriations matters. there are simple solutions or panaceas for this problem. i trust that some of the solutions which will begin to resolve these problems may be found in this bill.
. i placed in the record on march 21 last a report for the year 1973. it shows that the aggregate of these tax expenditures. as they are technically called. for the covered period was something in the area of $60 billion. this does  say that all of this was unjustified. it simply relates to the areas in which special treatment for tax purposes has been given. then. in the measure which is  in conference. out of the government operations committee. as to the budget process again. there are a number of sections resulting from amendments which i proposed in that committee. and which relate these tax expenditures to our overall budgetary view and what we ought to do about the tax in order to bring about a better relation between the expenditures overall and tax receipts when we face that problem in the annual budget measure. so the tool with which to work. with respect to tax reform. is available to congress. that is a big step forward. and is in precise tabular form at page 1408 and the pages which follow in the congres-
. the ecoy is essentially decontrolled. and that there were only 12 percent of the items in the consumer price index and 32 percent of the items in the wholesale price index subject to controls. what has happened is that phase ii was a success and phase iv was a disaster because of decontrol.  because of controls. the second point. which is critically important. and which we must always consider is. where would this situation have gone if we had had controls or machinery for controls. after all. our friends in the middle east did  think anything of raising oil prices 300 percent-- 14 percent. 300 percent. when we think of the fact that con"trols have been iniquitous because prices were brought up. the workingmen had better decide that they could have been destroyed if they had  been put on. the other factor which is sadly missing is that what we are contending for with standby authority is an army. navy. and air force in the ecoy. would we think of stripping ourselves of this security. this is exactly what we are being asked to do. this government is being asked to leave itself with means to govern.  even in the obligation to enforce commitments in contracts. by those who would oppose this amendment. a government which would consent to a situation leaving itself unable to govern is  worthy of the name. we may lose. but we are contending for the right thing. finally. i have been in business also. like some of my friends here. including my friend from illis . and i have been paid huge fees for running a business-
. as ed in the report on page 3. the committee did  add to the bill any provisions for increasing the relocation adjustment allowance but indicated instead that action is studying the problem. looking toward a constructive proposal for fiscal year 1976. i have joined with senators mondale and cranston. and others. in amendments which will be offered to increase the current allowances from $75 a month to $115 a month for individual volunteers generally. from $125 a month to $190 a month for volunteers with one or more mi children. and from $125 a month to $190 a month in the case of volunteer leaders. these allowances. which would be applied to peace corps and vista volunteers. are in each case. much less than those originally sought by senator mondale in s. 2814. of $125. $250. and $250 respectively. it is important that while it is a "volunteer program." that the allowances keep pace with the rising cost of living. which has been increasing at a very fast rate. these allowances. which are designed to enable volunteers to readjust to mal life after services. have  been changed since 1961.
. a very. very monumental bill has just passed after a weeks debate. withstanding all of the furor which preceded it. it is truly an education bill and  a busing bill. which is what we tried so hard to avoid. in summing up what happened in the last weeks of arduous debate. with its give and take. tribute is due. first and foremost. to the senator from rhode island . chairman of the education subcommittee. who. for 2 years or more worked on this measure and who has had the emous satisfaction. as the principal manager on the part of the majority. to guide it to final passage here on the floor. we all owe him a deep debt of gratitude. so do all the friends of education. and indeed all the people of the united states. we also owe a debt of gratitude to our chairman. the senator from new jersey
i would like to say that while i am  one of those who voted with the senator yesterday. though i had very sufficient reasons as one of the managers of the bill. be that as it might. concerning this matter of taxation i would like to put myself on record and i am running this yearthat one of the worst things that could happen in terms of inflation. which will cost the people dearly annually.  just right away. in the depreciation of their mony and in tending toward grave harm to our country. is a net tax cut. if we want to shift around the burden. that is our privilege. but a net tax cut. which i had the privilege of voting against in 1969 and which has helped to bring us where we are today. is really running risks with fire and a flimsy structure. i congratulate the senator for standing up and saying so. and i am with him.
. under the senate rules. i filed with the secretary of the senate on may 4. 1974 a "statement of contributions and hoariums" which discloses all contributions or hoariums received by me during the calendar year 1973. and it incorporates by reference all reports of campaign contributions which are also on file with the secretary of the senate. these reports are public documents. in addition on may 14. 1974. i filed under the senate rules with the comptroller general of the united states a "confidential statement of financial interets" which includes a list of my assets and liabilities and my 1973 tax return. however. that report is  available to the public and therefore i am publishing a list of my assets and liabilities for calendar year 1973 as filed on may 14. 1974. the listing includes: first. each of my interests in property having a value of $10.000 or more*. second. the assets held in a family trust established in 1937. of which i am the trustee and in which as a beneficiary i have a life interest. each item having a value of $5.000 or more. and third. each of my liabilities having a value of $5.000 or more. finally. i am including a summary of mrs. javits and my 1973 federal income tax return and the amounts of state and local taxes paid for 1973. i ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the record.
i was going to. in a sense. publicly confer with the senator from wisconsin on that score. i am advised. if we look at the bill which is at the deski have the original papers. so the clerk does  worry. right before me. and they are. of course. available to the senator from wisconsinwe passed this bill on may 10. 1973. so a year later we are back with the house measure. i understand in the interim this matter has gone through quite a struggle in the other body. it took a year to get it over here. even though it was cut in half. i gathered it was dead on one occasion over there. . i am  one to run from a fight. but i think. with the fiscal year coming on july 1. and with money in the till. we had better carry on this agency and do our fighting after we are sure there is a patient to fight over. so i believed the intention of the senator. in coming to the floor. was to ask us to take this measure. albeit with the greatest regret. i would like to state to the senator i agree. i think it is so close . and this has had such a rocky road. that if we sent it to conference . it is very unlikely we would get anything. but the senator may wish to consider that and perhaps let us k. before the end of the debate. how he would like this matter to be handled.
. i hope we might join with other senatorsi k that the senator from illis is deeply interestedto work on such a proposal in fiscal year 1975. in short. i do  think we should be bound by this particular provision for the whole year. if we can make a strong case. there is reason why we should be satisfied with this small amount. we take it because we have to. this is really only a beginning. rather than an end. so far as i am concerned.
i beg senator musgies indulgence. . the key to the fight on inflation is a grip on expenditures. which to me is as important as the amount of the budget balance. and so forth. i have had a long struggle here to try and put congress on a level with the executive. and this is one of the really historic steps in that direction. i. too. would like to join senator ervin in thanking the members of the committee. if i may be permitted to single out my beloved friend and colleague. senator percy. he did something beyond the call of duty. he actually went out and sold this program to the business leaders of america. their friendship or opposition could have been decisive. so i really think we are deeply indebted to him for carrying that part of the load. i also thank senator muskie for his collaboration with me on the bill and especially in the area of tax expenditures. i  ask the senator a question which relates to tax expenditures. that is. the tax indulgences and what they cost us. which is woven through the bill. because of my continuing interest and concern in the matter of indirect spending by way of tax expenditures. i proposed amendments to s. 1541 in the government operations committee that sought to include the concept of tax expenditures in the budget process as specified by that bill. my amendments were accepted by the committee and passed the senate with only mi changes. the purpose of the tax expenditure language in the present bill is to provide that tax expenditures shall be considered at each step of the budget process to measure their impact on budget authority and outlays. their effects on revenue and their general operations in the budget process. if this information is placed clearly before the congress. spending decisions will be made on a more informed basis than they have been in the past. it is essential that any contemplated changes in revenues through tax expenditures should be brought to the attention of the congress during the debate on the congressional budget. therefore. the report accompanying the concurrent resolution shall contain a list of the estimated levels of tax expenditures by major functional categories. most importantly in the case of legislation proposing new or increased tax expenditures the revenue committees of each house are charged with the duty of maintaining the appropriate levels of revenues and tax expenditures as set forth in the report accompanying the budget resolution or these committees must explain any deviation from those levels. while new or increased tax expenditures are  prohibited. the revenue committees will have the burden of explaining any changes and this should lead to a closer examination and more thorough debate of tax expenditures. the provisions of the conference report regarding tax expenditures are practically identical with the provisions of the senate bill. for purposes clearly of spelling out what is meant by the tax expenditure provisions in the bill. i ask unanimous consent that the appropriate parts of the report of the committee on government operations accompanying s. 1541 be printed in this point in the record.
the report will accurately detail the operation of the tax expenditure concept except for the inclusion of tax expenditures in the concurrent resolution. they are  in the report accompanying the resolution. it should also be pointed out that in the discussion of estimated revenues and their sources it is also appropriate to discuss tax expenditures as they bear directly on revenues raised through the tax system and any changes therein may have the result of increasing or decreasing estimated revenues. finally i would like to reiterate that it is extremely important to consider indirect outlays by way of tax expenditures in the general debate on the budget and also at such times as the congress is considering tax legislation. if we do this. decisions made in this area will be on a more informed basis than ever before and will be coordinated to a much greater degree with our direct spending through the budget process. . this legislation provides a workable way for congress to undertake its examination of the needs and program alternatives. and the allocation of revenues to diverse human and national needs. it will establish a means for more responsible and disciplined execution by congress to its responsibilities in the budgetpolicymaking fields. it will allow congress to acquire the means for the gathering of interpretive and analytical data on spending and related programs. most importantly. it will facilitate the use of objective expenditures analyses to help it form independent judgments on appropriations matters. there are simple solutions or panaceas for this problem. i trust that some of the solutions whcih will begin to resolve these problems may be found in this bill. one other change that should be pointed out is that section 311 which deals with limitations on consideration of new budget authority legislation. entitlement legislation or revenue reducing legislation also includes consideration of tax expenditure measures. i e that the managers added a statement at page 64 of the report which reads: although there is specific mention on the consideration of tax expenditure measures. the managers e that after completion of the reconciliation process. congress may  consider tax expenditures legislation that would have the effect of reducing total revenues below the appropriate level of the most recent concurrent resolution. i ask the senator from th carolina whether. therefore. we are right to assume that. basically. the senate provisions regarding tax expenditures are incorporated in this conference report.
. the bill provides in its section on foreign assistance. at page 5. lines 1 and 2. that expenditures under this continuing resolution shall be the "current rate or the rate provided for in the budget estimate. whichever is lower." the question has arisen in certain types of aidin this case. foreign assistance to israelthat there may  be a budget estimate on that item. the question is whether it is the intent of the committee. whether the budget estimate to which it refers is meant the budget estimate of the whole category for support and military assistance rather than a particular item that has to be named in order to qualify under that clause.
 signed public law 93326 which. among other things. funds this necessary program at $100 million for fiscal year 1975. since this new level was only signed into law on june 30. the committee has  -yet revised the appropriation to meet the authorization requirement. but there can be dispute as to the acts unequivocal intention to fund the program at $100 million for fiscal year 1975. i do   seek to amend the bill tc increase the funding level to the authorized $100 million but resolve the right tc do for for that action is more properly left to the committee on appropriation. in the first supplemental appropriationc measure brought to the senate. however i believe the additional funding shoulc be a matter considered at the earliesi practical time and should be included al the fully authorized level.
. as i suggested. in the field of antipoverty. the administration espouses the concept of "new federalism"-state and local governmental involvement. but offers neither adequate resources or mechanisms to make that a realistic alternative to the present situation. bloc grant or special revenue sharing approaches have  been adopted by the congress in the field of manpower training. as embodied in the comprehensive employment and training act of 1973. and are under consideration in other areas. it is premature. at best. to apply completely such an approach in the case of antipoverty programs generallythat is to give funds to state and local governments alone to use at their discretiongiven the opposition of some local governments toward the community action agencies. and the lack of experience in those fields. but it is  too early to provide the resources and mechanism to get state and local government into the picture and to provide incentives to forge creative partnerships between those governments and the community action agencies which have for almost a decade been viewed by the poor as "their agencies" while generally distrustful of the socalled establishment in the form of the state house or city hall. to do so. we have included in the bill a new concept of a "community partnership agreement" under which a state and local government on the one hand. and a community action agency on the other. if they agree on the terms. can conduct programs jointly. if they can agree. then the area may lose the funds allocated to itof course. maintaining present local initiative funding which goes directly to the community action agencies--and the lost funds will go to aher area. what they are able to agree uponin terms of administration. programs to be conducted. sharing of responsibilitywill be basically up to the agreeing parties. compatible with the concept of the "new federalism" that those on the local level should decide on the priorities. what we are proposing is similar to special revenue sharing with the element that the community action agency and the state and local government share equally in the overall decisionmaking process. for "community partnership agreements." the bill authorizes to be reserved $70 million for fiscal year 1975 and $140 million for fiscal year 1976. for fiscal year 1977. such sums as authorized. the national intergovernmental review board. to be established under our bill. would act as a highlevel catalyst to encourage the formulation of such agreements. as well as evaluate their implementation. it is hoped that this will bring new resources to fight poverty. act as a catalyst. and give the congress a real test of the extent to which state and local government will enlist in these efforts.
. reserving the right to objectof course i shall  object--i wish to use the opportunity to inform my friend and colleague that i have a modest amendment respecting the productivity commission. and i would like to inquire when it will be convenient for the senators to consider that.
in offering this amendment i would like to correct some of the misconceptions that have surrounded the national commission on productivity during its tenuous existence. for instance. the format of the appropriations committee report does  allow for the fact that although the ncop was appropriated $885.000 during fiscal year 1974 it was only for 6 months of operations because the organization did  technically exist and was forced to borrow funds from other agencies to provide the continuity to its efforts the congress expected. so although the amount here appropriated is technically $615.000 greater than last year it really does  provide for any expanded activities for fiscal year 1975 at a time when our ecoy can most use efforts such as these. i would also point out that when it was brought up on the floor of the other chamber. the chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on treasury. postal service. and general government and the ranking miity member felt that these facts ought to be sufficient for the senate to request additional funds in joint conference. on aher of the substantive issues raised by committee i would like to present for the record a statement of major representatives of the state and local governments of our nation which indicates that the ncop is perhaps the only agency of the federal government which has addressed the issue of productivity in a fashion which is beneficial and useful to state and local government leaders. i ask unanimous consent that the letter be included in the record at this point.
at a time when so much of our attention is directed to how we can control inflation we would indeed be shortsighted if we did  provide every opportunity for achieving the productivity gains our ecoic wellbeing requires. we have only to look at recent trends in productivity growth: 1.9percent decline in the farm sector during the last quarter of 1973 and 4.5percent decline during the first quarter of 1974 to realize the improvement we require does  come about automatically. i would like to include for the record an oped article by a. h. raskin of the new york times wrote last january voicing support of the commission. his concluding sentence is of particular e to my amendment proposed here today: saving the $2.5 million a year it costs to run the commission is ecoy if it cuts off that kind of independent blamefixing. the ncop will  be able to accomplish even a small portion of what this nation needs unless we provide them the resources.
the virtue in having this before us. . i sayas i explained to the senator from new mexico and the senator from oklahoma . i have had to make the case which they did . but i think it is conclusively made. and i hope very much. therefore. that we may go forward with what is really indispensable in a time of serious inflation. when the worst statistic in our country is the fact that productivity has fallen 8.8 percent as against its mal increase. and that we are practically at the bottom of the 10 leading industrial nations of the world in terms of productivity.
. i will vote for this amendment offered by the senator from west virginia to cut by 31/2 percent the entire appropriation for transportationrelated activities. but there are special circumstances that lead me to vote for this acrosstheboard budget cut that do  apply to others that have been offered and that i have voted against. it is because of those special circumstances that i support th4s amendment while opposing generally the meatax cuts in appropriations bills on the senate floor. this form of cutback in federal expenditures is both inexact and misdirected. acrosstheboard cutbacks take account of the legitimate priorities of federal expenditures and often will cause much greater problems and delays in some federal programs than others. the extent of the impact on each federal program is  measured and the need and importance of each federal program to the overall national good is  considered. fortunately. this will probably be the last year in which we must make such acrosstheboard cuts without guidance from a committee that has the expertise to judge the impact and necessity of the various federal programs impacted by the cutbacks and the aggregate federal expenditure against the aggregate federal intake. this budget committee. under the likely chairmanship of senator muskie. will be in a position to make those judgments and to recommend to the senate which programs can survive greater cuts than others and which expenditures are more critical to the nations immediate wellbeing. and he has already promised to ask the budget committee to apply this expertise to all the appropriation bills this yeari will join in that effort and if it dictates overall cuts i will support them. however. we are today presented with an amendment that has the endorsement of both managers of the billthe chairman of the subcommittee as well as the ranking miity member. these two senators are uniquely qualified to judge on the merits of this particular appropriation bill whether the expenditure cuts recommended will cause undue harm to any given federal program. because of their expertise. upon which we need rely. i am able to support this amendment even though i believe this procedure for trimming the federal budget is inadequate and problematical. will  consider this vote to be a precedent for me. inflation is our  1 problem and the impact on it of a federal budget deficit is great. i will endeavor to cut or eliminate such a deficit but wish to do so with the wisdom and discretion the budget committee will help us bring to the process.
. this was a very long strugglelasting over 3 yearsand many of the most ardent supporters of the legal services corporationincluding members of the organized bar who have contributed so much to this effortwere very sincerely concerned with the compromise bill. feeling that additional compromises should  have been made. this view was reflected on july 12. in an editorial in the new york times. entitled "saving legal services." that editorial described as a "risky solution" and a "high price." the compromise that we were then working out. today. the new york times has very graciously printed a letter to the editor by me in response to the editorial. which spells out exactly why i and the other sponsorswithstanding our own belief in the backup centers and concerns with restrictions on other points already in the billfelt the compromise was necessary in order to preserve the program and the concept of the legal services corporation. and urging swift implementation of the new law. in connection with implementation. i wish to e that i testified before the subcommittee on laborhew appropriations on july 25. requesting that the full amount authorized under the new law. $90 million for this fiscal year 1975. be included in the laborhew appropriations bill  being considered in the senate. i ask unanimous consent that my letter to the editor. appearing in the august 7 edition of the new york times. together with the original editorial of july 12. to which i referred. be printed in the record.
well. . i would have felt that the budget amount should have been allowed. but i k the devotion of this particular subcommittee chairman to this program. and i hope very much that if the agency finds really that it is restricted in its operations by this cut. even taking into consideration the total status financially in the arts of the country. that it will feel it has a sympathetic ear and may return. either this year in connection with a supplemental or in the next fiscal year. with the feeling that the cut does  represent any precedent of disapproval or any feeling that the budget went too far. but simply took account. as senator bible has said. of the overall necessities of this particular appropriation bill.
i thank my colleague and i will do that promptly. finally. . i wish to thank the committee for their consideration in providing the funds for the restoration of that great historic monument. fort stanwix in rome. n y. this is a project which the people o rome have been looking forward to fct some time and many of us. including the mayor. william valentine. have been seeking this funding. fort stanwix. whicb dates back to the french and indian -war is to be restored for the bicentennial celebration and the project will bring needed jobs and a boost to romes ecoy which needs it badly. i ask unanimous consent that an article in the washington post describing this project be placed in the record.
. an excellent editorial on causes of inflation and the measures to deal with it appeared yesterday in the washington post. written by ms. alice m. rivlin. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
well. question about that. if i implied what the senator states. i misspoke myself. the whole purpose of getting a coolingoff period is in the hope that the parties would think better of it. when i said inevitable. that simply emphasizes that there is cooling mechanism here. if the people seeking the increase persist. they will have it. they have way of stopping. unless we suddenly pass new legislation. but the fact is that certainly the reason for this coolingoff period is in the hope they will think better of it as there is public disclosure or debate. or they might find some other way of doing it. or find their purposes are well served. as many unions did when the cost of living council came back at them. there were reductions in what was sought in order to bring about approval. i would hope for the same kind of approach here. i thank my colleague very much for helping me make that point.
if he does. that negates the senators amendment. if our impoundment legislation in the budget bill meant hing so that he can impound if the president already has the power. then this does  mean anything. he has the power. we have power. it is a contest of power. but it seems to me that when we say that it becomes law. we are admitting that he does  have the power. otherwise what do we need this for. if we admit he does  have the power. i think we are giving him much too much when we require a concurrent resolution. in other words. it becomes law unless we stop it. we do  have to do that. that is way to confer authority. i would think that if one house vetoed. that would be adequcte. because that is assimilating our authority. but when we say we can only stop him by concurrent resolution. we are giving him the grant of authority. which i do  think we should do.
 has called for. and that we ourselves have called for. at that particular time. it will  be possible to raise any figure. it will be possible to reduce figures. but  to raise them. therefore. i felt morally justified in coming in with senator kennedy with this amendment at this time so that relative priorities might begin to be established which would finally be worked out when we fixed the overall budget. i am convincedand i really feel that every senator should be convincedwhether the budget committee does it or the appropriations committee does it. itself. with whatever input the budget committee can make. there will be such a resolution of the overall appropriations before us before we actually let them take effect and money is paid out on that score. in view of the fact that i think very. very deeply. as i will explain briefly in the minute. that job training and transitional public service employment is a critical element in fixing priorities. we come in to establish our priority at this time. i will appreciate it if the rankng member and the chairman oppose us. as undoubtedly they will. with their customary vigor and skill. but it was still our duty in order to assert the relative priorities to bring this matter forward. as the senator from massachusetts
that would be in the area of a little over 10 percent. and i think the special programs are so desirable that we would certainly want to do that much. i would point out the only restriction in the act is that the following quotation. which i make from the act itself. section 4(e). of the amount appropriated to carry out this act for any fiscal year.  more than 20 percent of such amount. excluding any amount in excess of $250 million of the amount made available for carrying out title ii. shall be available for carrying out provisions of titles iii and iv.
. my first question is this. as i understand the thrust of this amendment. it results in freeing states which receive a formula grant under this particular provision relating to the handicapped to use a part of that formula grant for ination and expansion grants for which the budget has proposed funding.
 proposes tax relief for low- and middleincome americans. this too. represents a commendable recognition of a severe problem. but  a wholly adequate solution to it. for tax relief is of little value to the poor who can survive at a level sufficient to pay taxes. and. probably .most important. is usually only relieves "casualties." we needin addition to relieving "casualties"-to avoid them. and the most immediately available vehicle to do thatalong with the antipoverty program itselfwhere i am pleased to say the committee on labor and public welfare has ordered reported a proposed extension. as i urgedis the social sevices program under the social security act. it is under the social services authority that the states and localities are authorized to provide a wide range of social services. including child carea needed component to any work program. as well as programs for the aged and others. to prevent welfare dependency. we  have an- agreement between the administration and senators mondale. packwood. bentsen. and myself. embodied in s. 4082. the social services amendments of 1974. introduced on october 3. for a new streamlined social services authority giving latitude to the states in terms of funding decisions and key matters--so important in new yorkof eligibility and fee schedulesto arrest welfare dependency. but while the states  have the authority to do the joband should in the near future have our proposed revised authorityoverall. they do  have the resources to do the job that will be required during the next 2 fiscal years if we are to relieve and avoid casualties. and the "villain" that stands in their way at this point is the $2.5 billion social services ceiling imposed as a part of public law 92512. the state and local assistance act of 1972for general revenue sharingand the further terms of the social security act which prevent any meaningful redistribution of funds from one state to aher. the ceiling was counterproductive thenand i fought itand it is all the more counterproductive and improvident .  only does it make it impossible for states like new york to meet new needs of the poor and others caused by inflationbut. because of inflation it permits less of an effort even than was contemplated when it was imposed in 1972. when we were  facing the dire ecoic prospects we do today. the library of congress has advised me that it would take about $3 billion today to provide the level of services possible with the $2.5 billion nationally 2 years ago. . and most unfortunate and tragic. states like new york have to try to meet over $800 million in social services needs. with $220 annually without even a meaningful right to receive money from states which have  used their allotments. the library of congress advises that of the $2.5 billion. $689.805.000 went unused in fiscal year 1973. $500 million is estimated to be unused in fiscal year 1974. and $500 million is expected to be unused in fiscal year 1975. i ask unanimous consent that a chart provided by the library of congress showing these figures in terms of each state be printed at this point in the record. there being -objection. the table was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows:
in fact in fiscal year 1974. estimates indicate that while a number of jurisdictions like new york struggled right up against their allocation. a majority of jurisdictions did  even spend what they were allocated. the new social service legislation. s. 4082. which i mentioned may make it posible for more states to do what they want and must. but to the extent that they chose  tobarring a change in the distribution formula - an unlikely prospect - why should  other states be given the resources they need. surely the congress intended that $2.5 billion be made available.  $1.9 billion or some other figuresthat is what expenditure ceilings are all about. the senate already agreed to the principle of redistribution. adopting a provision similar to that included in the measure i introduce todayas a part of h.r. 3153. to amend the social security act to make technical changes. but that bill. which passed the senate on ember 30. 1973. is still in conference. by including a redistribution provision in the measure. i seek to reinstate the intent of the senate. . this legislation is essential for the country. but is particularly important to new york. under a $4 billion ceiling. using the existing allocation formulanew york state could receive $352.7 million. rather than the $220.4 million it is locked into an increase of $132.3 million. additionally. it could benefit substantially from redistribution of funds  used by other states. these funds are crucial in new yorkbut particularly in respect to child care. for months. new york city and new york state have been engaged in a dispute concerning eligibility and fee schedules and for child care. with the state insisting on its standards and the city urging higher standards. this has been a continual battle. likelyuntil last saturdayto result in the expulsion of some 5.000 children from day care programs in the city. fortunately. following a recommended compromise that i made to both the mayor and the gover by telegram on september 12. the state and city have agreed. last saturday. october 5. on temporary relief for these ineligible basically through this fiscal year. partly from state and partly from city funds. i ask unanimous consent that the anncement. together with a copy of my telegrams to the gover and the mayor. be printed in the record.
 signed this measure- into ..aw on september 21. 1974. as you k the date of enactment into" law occurred after senate passage of the labor/hew appropriation bill. i.believej tlls law will* assure that we reagph the millions of young. americans at risk to drug addiction and provide them . crealive educational programs which- permit them to find pathways. to .productive. constructive. lifestyles and goals enabling them to realize their full potential.  however. i am concerned whether ther*e is any. commitment -to %the law since the fiscal year 1975 budget request is zero dollarsfor the only source of funding at the federal level for prevention and early intervention. programing through the use of the education process. when the fiscal year 1974 budget was .cut back from $12.4 to $5.7 million. supplemented by an interagency transfer from the. special action office for drug .abuse prevention of $1 million. the reduction necessitated: . dropping support to the 55 state and territorial education departments for inservice teacher training programs and technical assistance for local school districts. although. a number of states are continuing. these programs at -a reduced level. in many.. instances very effective personnel and programs were dropped. the reduction from seven to five regional drug training and resource centers. despite the recommendation of an interagency task force that they be continued. the reduction from fiscal year 1973 level of 900 to .250 interdisciplinary teams trained and provided onsite developmental assistance in implementing coordinated community response to prevent drug- abuse and other destructive behaviors. the funding..of only. six demonstration projects limited to preservice training of teachers to replace the 50 community. college. and schoolbased demonstration projects that had completed their.3year cycle. . the funding -of only 338 of over 1.000 local school district applicants for participation in. the schoolbased drug abuse prevention and early intervention program. without the $1 million transfer of the specialaction office even fewer could have been supported. this zero budget request. a tragic setback in. funding. will result in cutting off the .regretably too few federal prograims that reach appreciable numbers of rural. communities and school districts as wellas urban and suburban communities and schools in the area of preventio drug andalcohol abuse. an indication of the magnitude of need to assist the millions of young :34912 october 10. -1974 arrietidans at riskis that the drug abuse education aqt" was fiinaed from fiscal years 197174 in the amount of $37.7 million. during this -period the office of education received over 5.000 proposals requesting $117 million. such a funding shortfall means that many. valuableand- approvedprevention and intervention programs in youi state wer"  funded.  moreover. there are . reliable reports. that as a source mexico has replaced turkey as. the main illegal source of heroin. and -the cities.. of the south and west are -becoming major heroinusing "centers. at the same time. i understand the special action office for drug abuse prevention and the national institute on drug abuse. have reported afi.-increasing demand. for treatment forheroin addiction. primarily in the states along the mexican border. although the most dramatic changes are occurring in the south and the west. mexican herdin has been spreading like a brown tide across mbst of the united states. the drug enforcement administration i am advised recently encountered "mexican brown" in cities like boston and philadelphia. in my judgment it is only a matter of time--and unfortunately a very short time at thatbefore it hits the streets of our cities and the addict population again begins to skyrocket. . . the funds you appropriate will stimulate all. of us to grapple with a problem that must be attended to by all of us: teacher. student. parent. minister. policeman. clinician. and involved citizen. i believe it is all well and good to talk about budget cuts to lessen the possibility of fanning the fires of inflation. but we can stand by and see our childrens lives burnt out by alcohol or drug addiction. a history of the u.s: office of education drug education program is as follows:
. and the most important commendation of all is that our testimony indicates that if we want to step up employment. this is the safest way to do it. the testimony shows that because the sponsors are in place under the act. they can use the money and translate it into jobs within about 30 days. and that testimony is only as recent as a few weeks ago.
that was on the new program. we have an ongoing supervision over this program. and we have hearings on it many times. i am only talking about the presidents new program. . all that we are saying. if i mayand i respect greatly what the senator saysis that we are taking the presidents figure. because the fiscal impact is naturally very important. the presidents figure is the figure we are using. $500 million. which he contemplates under his own program. at 6 percent. this is as close as you can get to an analogy of his program in the interim. we ought to have this on hand in the interim.
they are spending the money. the senator ks that they would be hanged for improvidence if they were paying it out faster or differently than they do under the contract. let the senator give me the figure of accumulation on defense and then come .in here and defend a $82 billion budget for defense. that would make $2.5 billion for unemployment look like peanut shells.  just peanuts. that runs into $13.0 billion and piles up for years. that is all o.k.. and we are still to appropriate $82.5 billion. but  aher $500 million for the unemployed. when we have $2.5 billion. so what. we have 5 million people unemployed and let the senator multiply 5 million people by even $6.000. a year. and he will come out to an infinitely larger amount of money than we are talking about. i am  a bit intimidated. and we prepare this amendment with the greatest providence for our country. the man who made the budget estimate at 6 percent in the most authoritative way.  just privately in a back room of the white house. is the president of the united states. in a proposal described on the floor of a joint session of congress.
. hence. this program is completely unfunded. there is every reason for continuing itmuch more reason. in factbecause of the increase of the use than there was before. and that is why i gave the figures and the facts on the increase in use. so we come in and ask that it be made possible at the same rate as 1974 for the program to continue. i might point out. too. that i do  feel i am dealing with people who are unsympathetic. senator magnusons committee on appropriations provides for this $316 million for drug use and alcohol. that is drug addiction and alcoholism. and senator mcclellan was my particular hero because when i served on the committee on the judiciary it was he who recognized the situation and offered the first amendment to create a drug addiction program in the federal establishment. whatever may be their position on this particular matter. i shall be forever grateful to both of them. but i only point out that i do  argue in any oppositional way because i do  feel that i am dealing with people who are unsympathetic. but. again. i repeat. this is a classic application of what a supplemental is for. to wit. to fund a program which has been ongoing. where the law lapsed. where the law has  been renewed. and where there is way to get it funded except by a supplemental. unless we are to wait until the 1976 fiscal year which. i think. is hardly fair in a situation of this character. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. a table of the amounts of money authorized and expended starting in 1971 through 1975.
i thank my colleague very much and i am glad he agrees with my interpretation in this matter. the other thing relates to a particular matter of my own in new york. which i would like to lay before the conferees. first stating that the provision here in the conference report for the national cancer institute is unequivocal. it does  have any reservations or change laws of any kind. it is contained at page 10. lines 22 to 25 of the bill. etheless. i am advised by columbia university. under the hand of the vice president for health sciences. that a cancer research center which they are building at a cost of $32 million with the federal government contribution at the funding level of $5.890.000. which comes out of funds for fiscal 1975. is being resisted in the office of management and budget on the ground that the presidents budget has laid down some fundamental restriction about construction. this goes right to the impoundment controversy in which the courts have generally held with us. and in which our new budget control bill requires rescissions rather than impoundments if there is any particular item. all that i wanted to k is that the conferees had intention whatever in affecting the law upon this subject in any part of the work which they did. does the law stand exactly as it is.
. on the whole. it was a splendid incumbency as gover of new yorkelected four successive timesand also demonstrated certain unique qualities which i think should commend the inee to us very strongly. for one. nelson rockefeller was very hardheaded about money and did  fear. when he felt that it was essential to spend. and the state legislature was with him. to go to the people in order to be sustained in activities which were always difficult for a gover to go to the people onthat is. higher taxes or bond issues. he was ready to persuade and able to persuade the people of new york. in the most farsighted way. that the measures he recommended were so worthwhile as to deserve financial sacrifice on their part. which they made.
. i just wish to explain that in my statement i said $500.000. the figures read are $1 million. the reason is that half the fiscal year has expired. so that it is understood that in case will any appropriation be sought in excess of the pro rata for half the fiscal year.
. in the very same spirit just stated by the majority and miity leaders. i introduce for myself and 13 of my colleagues the full employment and job development act of 1975. the cosponsors are senators
 or the congress may direct. this measure is based upon the provisions for a full employment board contained in the full employment and job development act of 1973. which i introduced on may 3. 1973. with many of the same cosponsors. they included my principal cosponsor senator mondale. and senators brooke. case. hart.
. i am concerned that major u.s. international airlines such as pan am and twa may be competing at some financial disadvantage with foreign airlines because of the financial arrangements of the u.s. governmentowned exportimport bank. this conclusion results from a general accounting office study which i requested in august of 1974. the final report was submitted to me last week. this report concludes that "eximbank participation in the financing of exports at favorable interest rates has reduced financing costs for foreign carriers. thereby strengthening their capital position and enabling them to compete more effectively with u.s.-fiag carriers. on the other hand. through longterm debt financing and leasing arrangements. u.s. carriers acquired u.s.-manufactured aircraft at lower financial costs than the foreign airlines. however. these arrangements do  alter the fact that eximbank financing has reduced the advantage enjoyed by u.s. carriers. during 196973. interest rates that foreign airlines obtained from eximbank participation with private commercial institutions to finance the purchase of u.s.-made aircraft were about the same or more than the rates that pan american and trans world airlines paid for money derived from longterm debt and leasing arrangements. effective interest costs to foreign airlines rose from 6.4 percent in 1967 to between 7.3 and 8.5 percent in 1973. this rise resulted from higher interest costs. stemming in part from arrangements whereby commercial bank interest rates were generally set at fixed percentages above a fluctuating prime rate. the report also indicates that three american firms. boeing. mcdonnell douglas. and lockheed have been the chief beneficiaries of loans to finance the exports of commercial aircraft. between july 1. 1965 and december 31. 1974. according to the report. nearly 24 percent of nearly $5 billion of eximbanks total loan authorizations financed the exports of commercial jet aircraft. the gao report also shows that between 1970 and 1974. 78 percent or 586 out of 749 exported by boeing. mcdonnell douglas and lockheed were financed through eximbanks participation. like all americans. i am proud of the excellence of our jet aircraft and of the worlds preference for their use and their importance to u.s. export efforts. i believe. however. that this policy does  require us to abandon any consideration for the operations of u.s.-flag international air carriers which are in grave financial trouble. i question whether eximbank financing. as it has been placed. is essential for all future u.s. aircraft sales abroad. i bring to your attention the gao recommendation that eximbank consider such factors as foreign government ownership of air fleets and that the sales of most u.s.-produced aircraft are made to developed  developing countries. however. i am encouraged by the gao findings that eximbank has begun to modify its aircraft export policy by lowering its participation to 30 percent in individual cases and by increasing its interest rate to 8.5 percent. i ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the gao report be printed in the record.
we all k there are other bills. energy bills. tax bills. all kinds of bills that these amendments could ride on. they are  going to die between today and 2 or 3 weeks from . whether foreign taxes. depletion. or anything else. as a matter of fact. most of it can be retroactive. that is the way we have always handled taxes. and that includes windfall taxes on oil companies. the only question i was asking the majority leaderand of course he retains his independence. we all dowas whether he would add to his proposition one more point. which is critical. and that is. "for this time. to get this tax cut. to get it right away. this is the deal i am going to stand by. and i am going to be against any amendment."
 for the very solid reason stated by senator magnuson and senator schweiker. the solid reason is this: we are  going to save any money by doing what we wish to do. all we will do is disable the counties and cities from doing a good job by putting them in doubt as to termination of this program in the middle of the fiscal year. we will simply compound all the difficulties we have taken a long time to overcome and have  overcome. every one of these people will go on extended unemployment compensation. or. heaven forbid. on welfare. these jobs are very low paying. even the senator himself concedes in his own statement that they only come to around $6.000 a year.
what i have seen is the fact that we would  understand that when you get into a jam like this you have to invest and you have to take some risks. i think the budget committee has given us the budget which takes minimal riskswhich takes risks but minimal risksbut which should  be invalidated by the idea that we can raise the money or we will cause new inflation or a dearth of capital. i said in my own statement that for the long run.  for the long run. we would have to produce more capital than we have. but for the short run. i do  believe that this is a reason for kking down the proposal brought to us by the budget committee.
. i commend the committee for its farsighted and extraordinary action in having acted even before the authorization. indeed. i believe we were materially helped in respect to the authorization by the fact that the authorizing committee had already indicated its concurrence by the forbearance of a number of members with respect to offering other amendments. which would have been quite proper as dealing with emergency matters. but would have been extraneous to the fundamental thrust of the legislation. we all owe a debt of gratitude to senator mcclelan and senator young. the chairman and ranking member. and to senator iye and senator brooke. the chairman and ranking member of the subcommitte. for so completely coinciding with what is obviously the will of the senate and the best expression of the deep feeling of our people on this very sensitive subject. there have been a few untoward expressions of unhappinessone. because our own financial and ecoic situation is difficult. two. because of the distaste for vietnam. that has quieted down completely. and the compassionate heart of america has been revealed. the two senators have the privilege of translating that into action today. i congratulate them.
. the problems of the smaller cities. when they get into the big cities. are magnified into crises. and that is the real basis for the situation which causes this bill to be introduced. it is important to e the criterion of the bill that it applies to cities of 100.000 and over. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record. together with an article entitled "detroit pays steep rate on a debt issue. reflecting new york citys cash crisis." published in the wall street journal. describing the crisis. and a list of the cities of 100.000 or more in population. according to the 1970 census. of which there are more than 150. be printed in the record.
in the editorial. the times made the point that there was a very grave imbalance between the number of blacks and the number of blacks in our armed forces. attributable to the fact that this was  pretty much on a money basis. that gave me considerable cause for thought. and i think should give considerable cause for thought to every american. especially on the financial side. as the costs of military personnel in the armed forces budget run to about 54 percent of the aggregate manpower costs. and the aggregate manpower costs are about 53 percent of the aggregate budget. when we feel that our military budget is getting out of sight. it is heavily attributable to these personnel costs. in the analysis of the departmentand i am sure that that analysis. with rising expenditures. would be even greater at this particular moment. but let us take it as it isit calculates the net annual saving if we went to a draft. selective service instead of a volunteer army. as in the order of magnitude of $300 million or more an inconsiderable figure. when you add it to all the other morale factors. it is for that reason that my amendmentand here i would like to have the attentiton of the senator from georgia. who was very kind in saying that he would cooperate in elucidating these facts. i say to him. as a relatively new member. that the members of this body realize the great service which any of us can be to the senate if we really equip ourselves in particular specialties. and how helpful it is. considering the emous range of work we have. if a senator is reliable and highly informed on a particular subject. so i am very pleased to compliment my friend from georgia on his welldeserved reputation for really briefing himself thoroughly on these affairs. i would like to. if i could. go over the details of my amendment with him. in order to spread upon the record the facts and figures between us. to see what. if anything. needs to be done. i understand. i might say to my colleague. on the first item. that is. the ratio of enlisted men to officers. that there is pending and under consideration an administration bill called the defense officer procurement management act. a very extensive and complex bill which proposes to deal with that problem. and that the armed services committee is really digging into it. is that correct.
. . we will pick aher day upon which to fight. and i am so pleased that senator mcclellan. who is the chairman of that committee and a man of great authority in this body. said what he did about speaking to carl albert. whom i love as a personal friend but who. i wish. had  called the disgraceful situation the position of the senate. as senator mcclellan has explained. it is the house that caused the long delay. but even beyond that the senate has taken a very moral position and a highly publicspirited position at a time when additional jobs are so urgently required and when the public service jobs can be so very fruitfully used in this particular field. if there is a disgraceful situation it was demonstrated in the other body. and i hope very much speaker albert. who is a man of generally fine character and utmost fairness. will be willing to draw this matter to a close and consider it closed. just as we are here today.
. it should be ed that they have actually thought so much of the program that they have taken money out of title i of cepa. for which we owe such a deep debt of gratitude to senator magnuson. to supplement what they will get out of this program. that is true of the city of new york. for example. which has strapped itself of title i funds in an effort to have a cool summer. i am grateful to senators mcclellan. young. and magnuson for the very fine job which has resulted. and will be of emous benefit to every one of these icities. it is just about in the nick of time. it really could  be one day later.
. .inder the senate rules. i filed with the secretary of the senate on may 4. 1975 a "statement of contributions and hoariums" which discloses all contributions or hoariums received by me during the calendar year 1974. and it incorporates by reference all reports of campaign contributions which are also on file with the secretary of the senate. these reports are public documents. in addition. on may 14. 1975. i filed under the senate rules with the comptroller general of the united states a "confidential statement of financial interests" which includes a list of my assets and liabilities and my 1974 tax return. however. that report is  available to the public and therefore i am publishing a list of my assets and liabilities for calendar year 1974 as filed on may 14. 1975. the listing includes: first. each of my interests in property having a value of $10.000 or more *. second. the assets held in a family trust established in 1937. of which i am the trustee and in which as a beneficiary i have a life interest. each item having a value of $5.000 or more. and third. each of my liabilities having a value of $5.000 or more. finally. i am including a summary of mrs. javits and my 1974 federal income tax return and the amounts of state and local taxes paid for 1974. i ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the record.
. the senate will recall that this was a question of an appropriation to deal with an effort to hold harmless certain small states in respect of title iv of the elementary and secondary education act. i objected on the ground that the money would have to come out of the majority of states which would be benefited by that hold harmless and had been penalized by a previous hold harmless in a different amount. therefore. the amendment as it left the senate required authorization legislation before the appropriation could take effect. the amendment has been brought back to us appropriating the required money for the hold harmless. but which adds what would have been taken away from the rest of the states. but it does set a limit on what any state may receive of the amount that it recovered for the comparable purpose in fiscal 1976. as a practical matter. my own state and i gather many other states neither gain  lose on the exchange. and as i said before when we argued this matter. i had desire to penalize the states which were successfully held harmless by the amendment. i am agreeable to accepting the motion of the senator from washington.
. we have two fine senators who are managing this bill. and we all understand and recognize that. i have ed in the report and in the work of the committee. which i highly commend. that for the national commission on productivity and work quality there was a cut in the budget estimate of $500.000 by the house. and the senate committee went along with it. i do  blame them. because they probably were unaware of what i am about to tell them. this is the situation: in the committee on government operationsi am glad senator muskiie is in the chamber. because he ks a good deal about thiswe have been deeply concerned with the problems of productivity in the united states. we succeeded in working out a bill which has been reported and which i believe is on the calendar. i will check that in a moment. under that bill. we have  provided for a new approach of the productivity centers which will improve materially and expand the work of the productivity commission. indeed. it is a reorganizationthat is why it was in the committee on government operationsof the productivity commission. it involved the reconciliation of the views of two of the great aflcio unions which will be the most involved in the productivity problemthe steelworkers union and the united auto workers. fortunately. because my relations are very good with both unions. i was able to work out a reconciliation of those views. with the result that the bill was agreed upon. went through a great deal of consideration and discussion in the committee. and will result in the kind of decentralization of work on productivity and work quality to which i have been aspiring for 10 years and on which i feel the committee has made very significant progress. i k that senator percy is out of town. senator nunn may be in town. but he is   in the chamber. and i have  had an opportunity to talk with him. under the circumstances. inasmuch as this is a very gifted advancei am able to speak about it because of my very longstanding relationship to the productivity problemi inquire whether or  the managers would be congenial. for the purposes of today. to restore the budget amount. in order to take it to conference. so that the new factor of this new bill. which has been reported from the committee on government operations. may be considered by them. and so forth. inasmuch as we are under the budget estimate in this particular casethe amount is  all that great. and the issue is very greatif they felt agreeable to it. i would move to offer the amendment.
after all. the amount which is being appropriated is less than the budget estimate. so the president already has made his request. i point that out. second. i am bringing the committee new information which they did  have. which i think bears materially upon the ability of this critically important operation. which has  been satisfactory. we are the first to assure the senator of that. the senator ks how things move around hereglacially. it will be an emous step forward if at least it will be considered in conference. it is within the budget estimate. i am  asking the senator to go beyond that. it will get us 3 or 4 months on our way i ask senator muskie. if i am  imposing on him. to say a word on this matter. because he sat in very much on the deliberations of the committee on government operations.
i say to senator montoya that it is the new factor i am bringing him. the bill was dealt with very diligently. we debated the issues. it is cosponsored by senator percy and senator nunn. it has been ordered reported from the committee on government operations. and it represents the consummation of highly effective work by two of our greatest unions. all i am saying is that it will be encouraging. at least. if senators nunn and percy and i. as well as others. can come to the conference and lay before them the equity of the situation which is new. i agree thoroughly with senator montoya. he did  k anything about this. and he did exactly right. all i say is that perhaps we can save 3 or 4 months of very valuable time if the conferees are  convinced that this matter is going to be put on a new and infinitely better road. well worth at least the budget estimate. that is all i ask. i ask for commitmentsjust that the door be kept open. if the senator does  like it. he will strike it out in conference. but at least the door will be kept open.
in the first place. i say to my colleague that there are very few things that are as critical for our country as this. this is the guts of our country. we are down. way down in the cellar. as they say in baseball. on productivity compared to germany. japan. and many other countries. this has been a longstanding. heartfelt problem which i have tried to deal with. i have been very disappointed in this commission. as i reported to the senate. we are coming to life. we have  gotten reported out of the committee on government operations a really effective bill to shake this thing -up. all i am trying to do is win my colleague to a little faith in us. the committee on government operations. to give us the open door to conferences. the conferences can easily throw it out. if we can demonstrate to the senator that at last this thing will really deserve the money that is at least specified in the budget. i am really making it somewhat personal. if the senator will  mind my saying so. because there is hing on the record. i agree. on the facts as i am giving them to him . that is why i asked senator muskie to support me in it. because he sat through the sessions as we marked up this bill. after 2 months work. we are really beginning to go to town. i really ask the senator. on faith with us. at least to leave the door open so that if the conferees think it is deserved. they can do it. especially since i am  asking the committee to go beyond the budget estimate.
very good. as a matter of fact. the homebuilders. as the senator ks much better than i. think we are too low on this figure. that it ought to be $10 billion. but i am expressing my confidence. in answering them. in the senator from wisconsin and the senator from maryland and their judgment and their understanding of the situation. and the fact that they show themselves willing to lend themselves to high figuresand $5 billion is small changeand. therefore. it is an assurance that really it is needed. and it will be available. i gather they argue the fact that it is  of particular budget impact. but. be that as it may. i have faith and confidence in my colleagues. who have already done so well. and i mention them to the senate. finally. . i would like to commend the committee for the additional $100 million provided for. earmarked for. the socalled balanced community. the standard metropolitan statistical areas.- which are under 50.000 population. and where a formula has  worked out very well because of the extent of the demand which was unanticipated. it is  often realized. because i am from such a big state. where we have big cities. where we have the socalled big six. new york. buffalo. syracuse. rochester. albany. and so forth. but i also have a lot of people in a lot of other places that are under definitions of this kind.
 until i finish. i have only a minute. the senator from georgia had a great deal of time. -i have quarrels with thosewhoactas they do or seek new formulae. we faced it in education.  we face it in water pollution. and so forth. i hope very much that this reiteration of the same proposition may at last convince many senators. this is on the nice basis of cutting around 19 states or 17 states. whatever may be their population. their tax contribution. their essentiality to the nation. and other troublessuch as in the case of senator pastore. my home city of new york today has 11.7 percent unemployment. wonder it faces bankruptcy. it is  a surprise. matter what they do. so i rise primarily .to thank senator baker for his statesmanship. we furnish the sinews for war. and our blood is shed. just as is that of many other americans. except that we are 10 percent of the population instead of 1 or 2 percent of the population. i thank senator baker for his statesmanship in taking the position he has taken.
 ford signed into law last year. provides for the funding in block of certain groups of impact aid children. the statutory language mandates that all eligible children at three prescribed levelskn as "tiers"-be supported. or else funds may ise spent. h.r. 5901 simply provided sufficient funding for the first two tiers according to the authorizing statute. aher point to e when analyzing this bill is that there must be a sorting out of the advanced funding amounts for fiscal years 1976 and 1977. these amounts must be placed in the proper fiscal year in which they will be available. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this time some charts prepared by the very capable staff of the new york state department of education.
s budget proposal can be permitted to change the law of the land. i urge my colleagues in both the house and the senate carefully to review the real size of the increases in h.r. 5901. i believe they will conclude. as i have. that great restraint was shown by the congress. and that only the most urgent and pressing of our many unmet needs in education have been addressed and that this bill should become law. so that needed funds may flow to our schools and colleges.
. i support s. 2195. the bill to establish a new national center for productivity and quality of working life. historically. this nation has led the rest of the world in the production of goods and provision of services for its people. over the period of the last 10 years. however. we have been far outstripped by several european nations in achieving productivity growth. indeed. according to the bureau of labor statistics. output per manhour in the united states has declined 1.9 percent since 1966. it is my belief that our continued industrial leadership and prosperity is contingent upon our ability to recognize and deal with problems in the area of productivity and quality of working life. this legislation will establish a new independent agency within the executive branch whose function will be to coordinate federal efforts to achieve continued productivity improvement and to stimulate private sector advances. the new national center for productivity and quality of working life replaces the national commission on productivity and work quality. which was created by executive order in 1970. and given legislative recognition in 1971. over the past 5 years that commission has experienced organizational and funding problems which have hampered its effectiveness. it is our belief that the establishment of this new permanent center will provide the type of attention for productivity problems which i believe is urgently needed. the centers first goal will be to identify and coordinate productivity improvement efforts already underway in a wide range of other federal agencies. it will. in addition. be authorized to stimulate. initiate. and support productivity improvement efforts in both the public and private sectors where it finds such support is  currently being provided by other agencies. this legislation has been worked out in a true spirit of cooperation between all interested parties within the government and the private sector. the bill reported by the government operations committee is a direct outgrowth of s. 4130. introduced by senator nunn and s. 4214. introduced by senator percy and myself. i would particularly like to congratulate senators percy and nunn for the monumental effort on their parts which has culminated in the reporting of this consensus legislation to the senate. these senators have demonstrated a unique awareness and concern for the problems of productivity improvement. in addition. i would like to thank senator ribicoff. the chairman of the government operations committee. for his key efforts in focusing the attention of. our committee on this problem and in bringing this legislation to the floor in an expeditious manner. we must recognize that this bill and the establishment of this center represent but a first step in the effort to reestablish this nations leadership in productivity improvement and quality of working life of our people. as this center begins its work. it will undoubtedly identify many areas in which specific federal. state. or local legislation or programs will be necessary and valuable in furthering productivity improvement efforts. it is my belief that in this center we will have established an effective vehicle for the execution and administration of such further programs as we may find it necessary or desirable to enact. we must . however. believe that having established this center and passed this legislation that congress will have done its full part in the effort to regain our productivity growth. it may well be necessary to consider further legislation to provide specific assistance and stimulus to efforts aimed at increased productivity. it is my belief. for example. that the congress must develop additional legislation in the areas of employee stock ownership and profit sharing. greater participation of employees in jobrelated decisions. and continuing worker education programs in both job related and related fields. the funding authorization level contained in this legislation is significantly above that level which we have recently appropriated for the national commission on productivity and work quality. the committee carefully considered what level of funding would be necessary in order for the new center to adequately perform its tasks. i hope that the congress will look favorably upon a supplemental appropriation to provide the new center with adequate funding. because the life of the national commission on productivity and work quality is scheduled to expire on september 30. 1975. it is necessary that this legislation receive speedy consideration by the congress. i would urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that the center may begin its crucial task as quickly as possible.
.  to be used unless absolutely necessary. but at the ready if jobs are at stake. i believe the amendment will save jobs without any increased costs to the rest of the gas consuming public. and i urge my colleagues to agree to the amendment.
. i must say that i am pleased that these increases in the maximum endofservice allowance rates for both programs are included in the bill as agreed to by the other body. and i am most grateful for the excellent cooperation of the committee on international relations. these allowances are intended to be used by the volunteers at the completion of their service to help them in the transition to other endeavors and have always been paid at the maximum level in both programs. in the 14 years since the establishment of the peace corps. and in the 10 years since the establishment of vista. the consumer price index has risen more than 75 percent. there has never been a rise in the statutory maximum for the endofservice allowance for either program. it is high time we in the congress do something to rectify this situation.
i thoroughly agree with my colleagues that we should accept these amendments. they are important and useful. i want to emphasize the need for a network of action throughout the country to improve productivity. the center itself will be very helpful and a much better organization than we have had before in the productivity commission. however. we will still need action on the local and on the industrial level. until such time as we gear up for that. as we did in world war ii. there will  be a very marked effect of this type of effort on productivity. i express the hope that the center will move into its work promptly and will make recommendations through the president to congress or to congress directly as to what is needed to improve productivity. labormanagement productivity councils throughout the country might be necessary to bring this work on the local and the industry level to fruition. i thank my colleague. and i congratulate and compliment him and senator percy for their fine initiative.
i thank the senator. the other question is this: we are struggling for. and there is a bill on the calendar for. aid to new york city. there is a guarantee bill on the calendar. there is considerable discussion about a loan bill to take care of the cash flow problem. which is an idea that has just been floated as recently as a couple of days ago. ody ks whether it will be loans. whether it will come out of the federal reserve. whether it will be loans at all. or guaranteed securities. in the event of a default and a bankruptcy. we will have chaos and anarchy. unless some help on the cashflow proposition to meet essential services is provided. quite apart from the other tragic arguments. i wonder whether the budget committee considered that at all and what they had in mind about it.
the last question: i was responsible for an amendment respecting the tax expenditures. and so these impact on the budget process. may i k whether the budget committee is keeping the heat on for that and when we may expect reports and consideration of tax expenditures in the budget process.
. i wish to extend my congratulations to the members of the senate committee on the budget who have labored so diligently to produce this second concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1976. the second concurrent resolution appears appropriate for the precarious ecoic times in which we live. by any objective standard. the recovery is still fragile. as indicated by the recent increase in the unemployment rate to 8.6 percent from 8.3 percent of the labor force. the slowdown in the growth rate of industrial production from 1.8 percent to 0.4 percent. and the first monthly decline in new orders received by manufacturers in 6 months. furthermore. the mcgrawhill survey of planned capital investment expenditures in 1976 indicates increase over 1975 in real terms. even more significantly. the personal income gains of august and september were so adversely affected by rising prices and higher tax brackets that real. after tax personal incomes fell from an annual rate of $620 billion in the second quarter to an annual rate of $610 billion in the third quarter. the senate budget committee has grappled with these complex ecoic factors and inconsistent statistical evidence and has reported out a sensible resolution. i ask unanimous consent that a brief analysis of the ecoy by brookings institution be printed in the record. it is a useful and enlightening study of the present ecoic situation.
it will be ed that the state of new york is making cash payments to new york city of $800 million. and that additional taxes have been raised to the extent of in excess of $200 million. these are in addition to $330 million in taxes previously raised. therefore. although we do  have a breakdown of the standard and poor figures. i have talked with the gover of new york who is here in the capital. and. as far as the estimate of $4 billion for new york city is concerned. it can be accounted for in this way: that is. the federal $2.3 billion maximum. plus $800 million which the state has already engaged to pass on to the city and which is part of this package. i am sure the senator ks. and all senators should k. every part of the package leans on every other part. including this seasonable financing. it all has to hang together. and. therefore. the roughly $4 billion which were referred to there is made up of three items: federal seasonal aid. the states cbntribution. and the new taxation. . as to the states situation. the legislature of the state is meeting precisely for that purpose and has engaged in good faith to see that the state gap. which is a gap between its own income and outgo in this fiscal yearthe figure. incidentally. being quite controversial between the govers estimate and the leaders of the state legislatures estimate. the leaders estimate is about $300 million and the govers estimate is about $700 millionbut. etheless. the president. before he spoke. spoke to the legislative leaders in the state and he was satisfied there would be legislative action to close the gap for the state of new york. the point that was very important was that he was  saying how they should close it.  were we. that is something they will decide in a democratic way in the state legislature. but it will be closed. i have every reason to understand that the president was satisfied. i believe it will be closed. and the government does because our constitution demands it. and because the legislative leaders also k it fits in with this total package which i have been describing. so while i have  any idea as to what was the analysis of the officials of standard and poorand they are  omnipotent either. as was shown by the fact that for a long time they carried new york city bonds at a very high rating. probably they are excessively cautious . and who can blame them and. therefore. they are giving us the very outside estimates possible. i have accounted in this brief statement to the senator for how even those estimates can and will be met.
and the $800 million in cash loans which the state will make to the city. they have already engaged to do that. that is all settled and done in the law. that is $2.3 billion plus $800 million and $200 million in additional taxes to give you the order of magnitude i referred to.
. the senator might just as well say that it would be to our interest to see if we could cut out all federal irrigation dams. river power. subsidies to the maritime industry and the airlines industry. and many other things. and cut the defense budget about 50 percent. that would save even more money than the $5 or $6 or $7 billion that we spend in foreign aid. we can say that. because i conceive the word "fiscal responsibility" which is used by the senatori would rather strip it of all of those adjectives. and just call it responsibility. responsibility means that my people in new york are just as deeply interested in peace as they are in the saving of new york. if we believe. and we do. collectivelythough the senator has more than a right to his disagreementthat these programs are essential to the peace and prosperity of the world. then my people can say. "cut out the other and do us." we have to do our utmost to find a fair measure of justice. and we believe that it is found in this bill. in saying. "do us and do them. too." we have to find a way to do it. because we are just as much concerned with all of the great projects for which federal money is spent. with this tremendous budget that we have. as we are in our own municipal survival. i believe that i express the deepest interest of the people of my state in taking that attitude.
. i have just had an opportunity to consult the report of the congressional budget office on new york. and it is very relevant and pertinent to the questions asked indeed by senator bartlett and to some extent by senator bellmon. i ask unanimous consent that that section of the report which deals with the question which he asked: is new york unique. and why is it staggering under these burdens. be printed in the record so members may read it rather than detain the senate by reading this into the record.
at the top of page 4. the bill contains the following provision: in making the loan. the secretary may require such terms and conditions as he may deem appropriate to insure repayment. i would subscribe to the statement of the senator from wisconsin. and state that my understanding of the legislative intent of that is that it means payment on time. according to the terms of the agreement the secretary works out with new york. second. it is the intention of congress that the present fiscal year of new york city is the time within which loans are to be made and repaid. and therefore it is the legislative intent. as i understand it. that the secretary of the treasury shall crank that into any agreement which he makes with new york city.
that is fine. . 1 more minute. and these ecoies are  going to be backtracked on. they can be. we can engage so many hundreds of thousands of people and employees and millions in the state of new york in the legislature and the business community and turn on a dime and repudiate everything we have done. this is a total plan. every part of which leans on every other part. the 3year balanced budget makes us just about barely breathe. if we go beyond that. we can breathe. so the plan has to hang together. if it hangs together. i deeply believe it will work. but it has got to hang together. therefore. i hope this amendment is defeated. several senators addressed the chair.
the fatal defect of the amendment.  annced his new position collapses because it is based upon the fact that we will have this seasonal financing for 3 years. at the end of which time our budget must be and will be balanced. so this is just aher way to pull out the keystone of the arch and it all collapses. for that .reason. if the senator will allow me. i would like the privilege of moving to table this amendment. i do  do it yet. i am just asking senator tower.
 there are four locks on this door . one. the secretary of the treasury can set any kind of condition. two. the loan can be for in excess of 1 fiscal year. it must be repaid every fiscal year. three. it must be appropriated for. by congress. four. at any time in the proceeding by any condition the secretary of the treasury sets. he can call the loan and. according to any condition of his contract. if anything goes wrong. for those reasons i hope the amendment will be tabled. and i move to table the amendment.
the managers are aware. they say. that the legislation which is agreed to in the conference report would result in budget authority for fiscal 1976. "although it would produce net outlays." i assume that what that means is that. as the revolving credit is to be fully repaid before the end of fiscal year 1976. that is the reason for it.
and that if for any reasoe never ks what can happen to these thingsthere is a problem. it can be accommodated under the general item which would cover this kind of outlay in the budget resolution. that the law would permit us to deal with the revision of budgetary authority during the next session of congress.
. we can afford to ige the threat to our ecoic prosperity and the challenge to government ecoic policy implied in these statistics. if tax rates increase because we have  passed a simple extension and slight enlargement of the tax reduction act. $900 million could be removed from the ecoy in january alone. when this is combined with resumption of social security taxes for workers who earned more than $14.100 this year. we -have an omis threat to the disposable income of american consumers. the result can only be reduced consumer demand and a slowdown or decline in national production. in testimony before the senate finance committee on december 9. treasury secretary simon asserted that discipline was required to control the share of gnp channeled through government. i disagree with the timing and relevance of that argument. this is neither a time for being harded  a time for careless largesse. two years of recession. doubledigit inflation. and 8 percentplus unemployment already has provided discipline for the american people. i submit that this is a time for reasoned judgment and for thoughtful analysis. in the context of our present ecoy. reasonable americans are led to conclude that maintenance of current tax rates is both a judicious and a prudent course for public policy to follow. this is a prudent policy because it takes into account the condition of abmally high unemployment that is expected to persist through 1980. i simply can share the improvidence and cynicism that seem to characterize our present leisurely approach to the restoration of full employment. i believe we must strive to get the unemployment rate down as quickly as possible to a mal level. a policy of maintaining current tax rates through 1976 is a judicious one because such a policy would insure more rapid recovery during the period when the slack in the ecoy was greatest. with an 8.3percent unemployment rate and an emous gap between actual and potential gross national product. we are in the most strategic position for continuing mild fiscal stimulus without reflating the ecoy. . what concerns me most about the debate over the tax cut extension is the growing evidence that the congress and the administration may be approaching this question from two different viewpoints and with two different motives. my own analysis has been couched in the context of the present and projected state of the nations ecoy. from the perspective of the longrange needs of our ecoy. i have concluded that maintenance of current tax rates is a prudent and judicious course for fiscal policy. i suspect that the administration. on the contrary. has proceeded to develop its analysis as an examination of the appropriate role of government in the american ecoy. according to that point of view. a combined spending reductiontax cut program is recommended in order to halt the growth of the governments contribution to the ecoy but i believe this aborts the whole budget committee process by which the spending ceiling to be agreed on is based on expertise and cuts we made wisely with a scalpel and  a cutlass--for the budget directly affects the lives and fortunes of 220 million americans. but i think that this is an iportune time for such deliberation. i have thought a good deal over the past few years on such subjects aseapital formation. profit sharing. antitrust. and the related questions of the status of the american private sector. questions such as these require serious attention and they demand legislative consideration. but the issue of the growing role of government in the ecoy can receive adequate analysis when it is treated as a part of ecoic recovery legislation. the goal of a larger share of the ecoic pie for the private sector can  be achieved unless the pie itself is growing. if it is shrinking--as it may very well be if higher tax rates drain over $10 billion in purchasing power from consumers in 1976the share of both sectors will diminish. it seems that the administration may be willing to jeopardize the health of our ecoy in order to foster the development of a particular politicalecoic philosophy. to sacrifice the recovery of this nation on the altar of philosophical expediency is a dangerous game. i ask unanimous consent that certain supporting press articles be included in the record.
i am  so young in this body as to believe that in a budget running into several hundred billions of dollars that the administration could  find money to do this. it would obviously bar them from using money in the $90 billion. but i really believe with such a precision of expression by the senate and the house on such a major bill as the defense appropriations bill. i would  believe the administration would move in that direction and. if it did. i assure the senator there are lots of other ways in which a body as large as that majority which turned down the griffin amendment could see that they rue the day. so i do  believe we are acting other than very substantively and decisively if we adopt the amendment i have sent to the desk. may i say. . that amendment is for myself and senator humphrey of minnesota.
. i confirm. of course. as an active participant. what my colleagues have said. more than that. the senate should k that one of our reasons. too. was that this is  locked in forever. that it is an authorization. it is still subject to the appropriations process. it is subject to the continuing resolution process. it must stand really as it is. in all fairness. as pending action on the succeeding fiscal years budget. it is transitory. a onceinalifetime proposition. we are adjusting to a totally new system. it was the only way to go. in all fairness to all involved. and our committee felt exactly that way. so i think the senate can feel reassured that. as my colleagues say. although the amounts are large they were  casually dealt with. but it was a very considered judgment based upon the actual situation as we find it . again i repeat it is a onceinalifetime situation. and i am confident we will deal with it successfully.
. we realize that we do  just sell arms or give arms. we make policy. in that. perhaps. the revolutionaries are right. that policy comes out of the muzzle of a gun in the sense we can also make very intelligent policy in determining whom we will help and from whom we will withhold help. we hope the nations we sought to send a message to have gotten that message. i hope that legislation in its final form carries the same spirit and the same historic turn toward a more worldencompassing policy than we have had before for all of these years. for this. we owe a very profound debt of gratitude to senator humphrey and senator case who epitomized. as a team. the best in bipartisanship. i am delighted to have had the inestimable privilege of working with these two colleagues and of having had a part with them in fashioning such an important measure.
. today i join with senator weicker in introducing a bill to amend the community services act of 1974 to increase the federal share of financial assistance to community action agencies. as ranking member of the committee on labor and public welfare. i have been involved with the community services administration since its inception. as the office of ecoic opportunity. the community action agencies have played the integral role in identifying the ecoically disadvantaged and representing the interests of low income groups. the objective to provide access and opportunity for people to take control and make the decisions that affect their lives still remains the cornerstone of community action agencies. caa programs are unique in their focus on the needs and problems of low income people. they provide a flexible mechanism for dealing with the problems of the poor because their programs are locally determined and controlled. a good number of services which would otherwise be unavailable are provided. such as health. day care. and advice on insulating homes for winter. as part of a national conservation of energy and winterization program. the community services act of 1974public law 93644was passed in january 1975. it called for a reduction in the percentage of federal financial assistance for the nations 889 community action agencies. the original matching share was 90 percent for federal matching funds in 1964 and remained at that level until 1967. when it was reduced to 80 percent. under current law it has been reduced to 70 percent in fiscal year 1976 and 60 percent in fiscal year 1977. for all programs receiving more than $300.000. for those funded at an approved cost of less than $300.000. the share is reduced to 75 percent in fiscal year 1976 and 70 percent in fiscal year 1977. the rationale of last year is longer operative. present fiscal constraints on local and county governments could  be foreseen last year. the reverse in the ecoy have taken its toll. causing a loss of revenues to cities and counties and a commensurate cut back of services. their ability to contribute a matching local share has been severely curtailed. a recently completed survey undertaken by the national center for community action has concluded that 79 percent690 caas out of 889will be unable to meet the requirements of the increase in the federal share on fiscal year 1977. neither state or local governments are in financial positions to support the local caas in providing increases of present local matching funds. the study shows there will be a reduction of 10.000 jobs if the federal share is increased. and if the fiscal year 1977 budget request for $260 million is appropriatedas compared to the $300 million in fiscal year 1976. the dual pressures on caas will cause increased hardships on the agencies. and a reduction in services they perform. the burden of a reduction in the funding level recommended by the administration budget request for fiscal year 1977. is compounded by the burden to increase the proportionate federal share. the survey finds that this will be too heavy a load for the local caas to bear. to continue the matching ratio would mean a severe program cutback and staff layoffs. the fiscal urgency of our cities and communities has been well documented in many congressional hearings. certainly. the plight of new york city needs further documentation. new york city has been forced to cut back the local matching share to the community action agencies. formerly the city provided a local share of 50 percent to the antipoverty efforts. however. it has been necessary to make cuts of $7 million to the caas and it has reduced its share to the prescribed ratio of 20 percent and just can do more. those that will ultimately bear the cost of these cutbacks are those that can least afford it. the low income families who depend on the community action agencies. for so many services will have even less to sustain them. it is for these reasons that i join in cosponsoring the proposal to maintain the federal matching level. the need for the continued strong federal commitment is essential. especially in our current ecoic situation. we should  ask these most in need to bear a greater burden than they  must carry. by enacting this bill. we affirm our commitment to the ecoically disadvantaged and to the community action agencies who have served them and provided a unique impact upon attacking the problems of poverty. by mr. sparkman (by request):
i would like to ask the senator from maine. with whom i have been in accord. on the countercyclical provision. how he does justify the changes to which senator baker has called proper attention. that is. the 4.5 percent employment trigger and the change in the formula relating to tax effort. is or is this  really simply an extension of revenue sharing. which i would  for a minute denigrate. we need it badly in the great cities. but could we k what his reasons were for revising these essential elements of the formula as he did in view of the fact that he is maintaining his fidelity to the countercyclical concept.
is a key element then this 41/2percent figure. because that seems to me to be what has changed the focus. in other words. is a key element in what the senator has decided he must do withstanding. as i say. the danger of more loss than gain. the 4 -percent figure. because that is what changes the focus from a countercyclical program to a general revenue sharing.
. under the senate rules. i filed with the secretary of the senate on may 14. 1976. a "statement of contributions and hoariums" which discloses all contributions or hoariums received by me during the calendar year 1975. also it incorporates by reference all reports of campaign contributions which are on file with the secretary of the senate. these reports are public documents. in addition. on may 14. 1976. i filed. under the senate rules. with the comptroller general of the united states a "confidential statement of financial interests" which includes a list of my assets and liabilities in 1975 and my 1975 tax returns. as that report is  available to the public and as i have heretofore followed a policy of annual financial reports for many years. i am publishing a list of my assets and liabilities for calendar year 1975 as filed on may 14. 1976. the listing includes: first. each of my interests in property having a value of $10.000 or more. second. the assets held in a family trust established in 1937. of which i am the trustee and in which as a beneficiary i have a life interest. each item having a value of $5.000 or more. and. third. each of my liabilities having a value of $5.000 or more. finally. i am including a summary of my 1975 federal income tax returns and the amounts of state and local taxes paid for 1975. i ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the record.
. the committee on appropriations has recommended education funding levels in h.r. 14232 which reflect a recognition of the continuing federal commitment in this vital area. in total. the recommendations provide for a modest increase of approximately $860 million over comparable fiscal year 1976 levels. this means that the education programs and activities administered in hew will be increased by approximately 15 percent. as the housepassed measure contains only a 5percent increase for these programs. the likely legislative outcome will provide for inflation and a slight increase in funds for a few highly meritorious education programs. i commend the gentleman from washington and the gentleman from massachusetts . together with other members of the committee. for their long and arduous efforts in developing this bill. which contains a number of worthwhile increases which i shall highlight. i intend to vote for this bill and urge my colleagues to support this measure.
. recently the govers of the theastern states of the country met to pledge their mutual support for a program of regional ecoic growth. the need for such a program is clear. during the past decade. population shifts financial trends in this country have favored the nations "sunbelt." at the expense of the older th and theast sections of the country. this is a trend that we have welcomed and fostered. indeed new yorkers and new york money. for example. can be found in every state of the south. however. it has  been without its cost to us in the theast and midatlantic region. a cost which has only recently begun to be studied and quantified. in this regard. i commend to my colleagues a recent article in the washington post by a leading ecoist on this subject. neal peirce. who is with the woodrow wilson center here in washington. points out some of the dramatic and disquieting facts which make up this modern phee. between 1969 and 1973. for example. total employment rose 17 percent in the southern states. but only 1.7 percent in. the midatlantic states. during the same period. new york actually lost jobs. and in fact. lost population as well. as we continue to grapple with the problems of new york city. we should realize that there is this substantial federal responsibility here. new york city is part of the problem. it has lost jobs to almost every section of the country while assuming. as mr. peirce points out: the heavy social costs of the often dependent puerto rican and black populations that have moved into the center cities * * * i am  making excuses for new york city  am i suggesting that we should restrict population moves. but i am saying. as this article emphasizes. that there is a substantial federal responsibility at stake which is only just  surfacing in the public eye through the writings of seriousminded people such as mr. peirce. i commend this article to my colleagues attention and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
the office. with a budget of $500.000. which is about what we estimate. and we make that estimate based upon the fees which have been paid to a special counsel by the congress in various cases. should  involve more than on the order of magnitude of 10 lawyers and. say. 15 to 20 additional personnel. if we find that we are in a vast field of legislation or we have some special situation. i mean. it is something i can foretell. but the mal size of the office. based on a $500.000 budget. should be about as i have described it.
there is question about it.  only do we make clear that it is a true value. but the internal revenue service is satisfied. as i stated before the senator came in. that it has tight procedures for an accurate valuation. .the commissioner of internal revenue has a panel which passes on these items in three meetings every year. composed of some of the most distinguished artists and directors of museums in the united states. and gives them an airtight valuation.
all right.  that brings me to this point: has any effort been made to enlist the alcohol industry itself in this kind of a program by opening up in the fund the possibility of contributions by them. i will tell senators why i ask that question. this 21/2percent tax the senator talks about. obviously  in the bill. but the bill contemplates a relationship between taxes and the fund. that comes right out of the consumer. the alcohol industry. which i happen to k a little about. has made a big point about devoting itslf to temperance. and some of the leading firms in the business have engaged in advertising campaigns respecting temperance. i would hope. may i say to the senator. and i think this is an excellent ideaand. mind you. i do  decry it in any way and i give the senator credit i for the initiative that he has takenbut 2 i hope in the amendment the senator - would allow for the possibility of some f agreement with the industry itself bee cause that would be out of profits and e it would  come. as the tax surely will. i right out of the consumer. and i think 5 the senator ought to think about that o in his own interest. i mean in the structure of what the senator is doing he ought to consider accommodating that possibility because they have made a big point of it that they are interested in temperance. they do  want to get themselves into a situation of where they are driven to the wall because their situation is even worse than it is. and you and i k how bad it is even .
. last friday. july 30. the department of labor and the internal revenue service issued proposed regulations to guide the adoption and use of employee stock ownership plans covered under the employee retirement income security act and under the tax reduction act of 1975. the tax reform act of 1976 would make permanent and double the present 1percent investment tax creditesop covered under the proposed regulations. i believe the regulations directly bear upon the amendment which i will call up tomorrow on behalf of myself. senator humphrey. and senators percy. muskie. proxmire. and kennedy. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record. the wall street journal account of the nature and purpose of the esop regulations which appeared in yesterdays edition.
the journal reporter believes that the regulations were issued because "some esops may expose workers to unnecessary risks by investing in companies with uncertain futures." the article goes on to explain the need for caution where esops are used as conduits for loans to companies. in many cases. esops are used because of the tax advantages and financing possibilities they afford to companies. the labor department and the internal revenue service have recognized and have attempted to limit the potential for abuse that exists whenever esops are utilized for corporate financing. estate planning. or divestiture purposes. such risks to which employees may be exposed were outlined in our "dear colleague" letters and in my statement upon introduction of our amendment. the scope of the regulations indicates that the dangers to the employees are genuine. but i am concerned that this area is too conplex and the potentials for abuse of esops are too insidious to be handled by regulations alone. only after receipt of public comment on these regulations will we be in a position to consider permanent incentives. indeed. after public comment. we may see the need for broad and supplemental legislation containing new safeguards for employees participating in stock ownership plans. the regulations affirm that much remains to be learned about the esop mechanism and its potential benefits and abuses. we must go forward in studying esop and all the other alternatives for broadening employee stock ownership before closing the door with permanent tax provisions. i propose that the relevant committees of congress use their own expertise to investigate and examine the different vehicles for expanded stock ownership. only upon conclusion of that examination will comprehensive and permanent legislation be in order. the wide scope of the regulations indicates also that much work still must be done by congress before we make permanent incentives for one particular plan. the public has been asked to comment on the proposed regulations by september 30. and of course. one ks what will surface by that date. in any case. it is apparent that enactment of permanent legislation. such as that contained in the tax reform act. and in the form of an amendment to a tax bill. would be premature and imprudent. i might add that one of the regulations proposed for investment tax credit esops is particularly germane to our amendment. some have maintained in support of the permanency provisions of the esop tax credit contained in the tax reform act. that companies will  adopt esops unless they can be certain the tax benefit will be continued permanently. since the law requires continuing contributions to such plans. the proposed regulations would permit a company to satisfy the permanency standard as long as it contributes the tax credit proceeds in the years the credit is available and in which the company qualifies for it. the regulations state: (ii) permanence. a trasop will  fail to be a permanent plan merely because employer contributions are  made for a year for which the 11percent credit is  available. this means that a company may establish a tax credit esop under our amendment. transfer its allowable amount of tax credit to the plan this year and. if the esop tax credit is  extended after 1977. never again have to make aher contribution. certainly. then. the regulations eliminate the reason given by the finance committee for immediate. permanent esop tax credit extension. i urge my colleagues to obtain a copy of the federal register of friday. july 30. and to examine the comprehensive regulations that have been proposed. the proper course available to us at this time. therefore. is to give esop the benefit of the doubt. extend the credit for 1 more year at 1 percent. and begin as soon as possible the task of conducting hearings and drafting legislation on employees stock ownership an essential area of national ecoic policy.
. it is my duty. and that is why i made this amendment. there is interest whatever of mine involved. except my sense of conscience and duty. it is my duty to avoid. if i can. a type of plan which i considered inimical to the interest of most workers all. again i repeatthat should be discriminated in favor of and supported with taxpayers money. when it is by means the best plan for workers and when there are lots of other tax advantages that the employer gets in stock ownership plans. i must say i can see why we should discriminate in favor of this particular type of plan which has been picked up by a very small miity of employers. i say i do  see why. but i do see why. the reason is that this particular plan has as its passionate advocate a very influential senator in the senate. and that is senator long of louisiana. i ho him for his passionate devotion to the fact that workers should own stock. this is where i came in 30 years. or more. ago. so i have quarrel with that whatever.. but i beg him to consider in the interest which he. i. and many others share. encouraging stockholding by workers. whether or  he is really right. he has the votes to beat us on this. in my judgment. i can count too. as well as he can. but i do  think that proves anything. because in the years ahead it is going to be necessary for this particular approach to have patronage. unless it does and for reasons other than the 2 percent free ride. which favors. by the way. only heavily capital impacted industries. it will fail. it does  favor service industries. there are such manifest injustices in this type of plan as to rate from him consideration. he is a man who has a real passion. which i admire. for this particular kind of approach to a peoples capitalism which i thoroughiy share. so i hope that the debate. and that is why i hoped to bring members in the chamber. may be listened to. in this case it is worthwhile.  only for  but also for the future. whatever we may do upon this particular amendment and in this particular senate.
may i simply explain to the senator my. position on that. i shall send the senator a copy of a book i wrote 12 years ago. in 1964. strongly advocating stockholder ownership plans for workers and. as i say. i have been at it most of my adult life. the difficulty with the esop is that it contains unnecessarily within itself certain serious deficiencies which make it suitable for a very small part of the working force to attain or move in the direction of what the senator explains. as this basic bill which i am seeking to amend reduces a benefit which distorts the judgment as to what is the best kind of stock ownership plan for the worker. it gives a premium to what i consider a plan which is far from the best and in view of the fact that is has been embraced only by a small number of employers. whereas stock ownership plans generally art embraced by many employeesby means as many as we should encouragei feel that to waste this roughly $250 million on this is  fair to other plans and  fair to the total effort to bring stockholding to workers. i said when i began that this is a subtle argument. but it is our duty. the duty of people like myself. who are deeply involved in a field. to bring it before the senate. even if it is a subtle argument. the fact is that this is a real and potent argument. the fact is that senator long admits the following: one. he said in a letter to the wives of our membersby the way. i think it is a very ingenious idea. and i compliment him. he said: in my judgment. the most important single feature of the tax reform bill is the fact that it provides for 2 percent investment tax credit for employee stock ownership plans. that is saying an awful lot. because this is an important and a big bill. second. senator longs esop plan. which he favored before with 1 percent of investment tax credit indulgence. has  attracted many takers. he admits that. he says in a "dear colleague" letter. i-.hich i also have before me. that he hopes that the 2 percent will stimulate interest in that type of plan. thatis what gets me. we are giving tax indulgence. an employer can deduct up to 15 percent of his payroll to support a plan such as this. let us at least be evenhanded about it. give it to all plans. give the worker an interest in stock. we do  do that. and obviously cxxii- 1614part 20 we can. with this 2 percent credit. because it will really run into the hundreds of millions. so. instead of relying solely upon the merit of the plan based upon the same tax consideration for all plans with the same objective. we are picking out esops as a unique case. and they are  worth it. that is what i aan arguing. do it for everybody. which obviously would cost infinitely too much money. but do  do it for one plan among thousands and do  do it for a plan which. standing on its own. on its merits. has attracted so very little patronage. why has it attracted so very little patronage. for one. the stock distribution which this involves is what is called leverage. the whole scheme is really a scheme for employers. because it profits by the fact that money can be borrowed by a trust which is a trust for the workers. money can be borrowed by that trust. and the payment which the employer makes annually will pay the principal and interest. and that. up to 15 percent of his payroll. is tax deductible. he gets a big benefit from that. the leverage is kind of lifting yourself up by your own bootstraps. that also assumes that stock will only go up. if stock goes down. the whole leverage idea collapses. because a debt is due. and the value or price of the stock may have receded very materially.
my argument is that we are following greshams law. we are putting our money into less efficient plans. thus bringing people to install those plans. whereas. if we treated all plans evenly. we would give them an opportunity to choose the most efficient plan. that is what i am arguing and that is why i am on my feet. i repeat. i am an ardent advocate of the workers participation in stock. but if we are going to discriminate in favor of a particular type of plan. which is a tiny miity plan. we are going to draw away interest in. participation in. and concern with other types of plans. which are much more promising because they are infinitely more numerous. therefore. i feel that by doing what we are doing. we are misusing our financial power by favoring a particular type of plan which is far from what is best for the worker. i am  saying that some other plan of my devising may be better for the worker. i just say on that. because there is plenty of tax advantage in the employers deduction which he has for any workers stock plani say let us be neutral. let us  favor this plan. i point out its deficiencies merely by way of proving that we should be neutral. that we should  discriminate in favor of this particular type of plan. which has had so few takers. the only argument senator long makes is. "i want more people to take this particular type of plan.  because they select it as the best. but only because they are going to get a 2 percent break on their investment tax credit. and if they are a heavily capitalimpacted business. it is a profitable thing to them." that is my argument.
at the end of that debate. . the amendment at the desk. i believe. is  satisfactory to the manager of the bill. we worked it out after discussing it with the staff. it does the following: it gives 30 percent of the fair market value deduction for artistic work against tax. as a credit against tax.  as a deduction from income. however. this credit is limited as follows: it is a credit against tax paid on an artists income from his art work. hing else. second. it can wipe out the taxpayers liability if his tax is in excess of $2.500. since if his tax is in excess of $2.500. the credit may  exceed 50 percent of his tax liability. last. the aggregate of such gifts eligible for the credit in any year may  be more than $35.000. it has a carryforward provision. and i told the senator from alabama who raised the issue in respect to the carryforward. that i would be willing to limit that to 5 years. it is  actually in the amendment i have sent to the desk. because i wanted to hear from the senator from alabama.
. on employee stock ownership and broadened stock ownership. this amendment takes into consideration the matters which senator curtis raised by his amendment. we had a very. very fiery debate on this subject here. the principal cause was the fact that a particular type of employee ownership stock plan was favored by our tax laws. although it was relatively little used. whereas the overwhelming majority of thousands of employee stock ownership plans were  given that kind of favorable consideration. senator curtis then raised the issue of broadening among all americans employee stock ownership.
. i do  think there is any place in the country that is more impacted with the problems of insufficient and inadequate housing than my city and my state. we have 30 percent. i am told. unemployment in the construction industry. and great areas of new york are literally ravaged in terms of housing. this amendment. i think. is indispensable because we still are dependent upon private initiative. let us leave out any other consideration. whether it is insured or guaranteed or there are tax advantages. people still have to take the bit in their teeth and move forward. with the other attempts. the initiatives from various segments of the government are  too appreciable. when you add them all up. i am advised by the very people who have these initiatives that this amendment to the tax law is absolutely indispensable. i am grateful to the senator from alabama for what he is doing. and i support him fully.
. that is. a gross course for the continuation of title vi and for the public employment projects which i have described. those which will be targeted for a duration of 12 months with a limitation of 1 years employment. and a limitation of cost to us. putting it in roughly the $8.000 per year range. but that $3.5 billion cost is offset by federal budget savings. that is. the tax of the wages received. and the relief of the public budget from various other income maintenance payments if those people continued unemployed. so the net budget cost on a gross cost of $3.507 million is $1.543 million." i ask unanimous consent that the letter to our chairman. senator williams of new jersey. from alice rivlin. director of the congressional budget office. be printed at this point in my remarks. it contains a very detailed analysis and justification for the figures i have just given.
 there is only one reservation. i joined with senator pell in these answers and i shall  repeat them so long as we are in agreement. but on this matter. i must make this point: the senator ks that recommended amounts which we sent to the budget committee respecting education has been partially diverted to health programs by the committee on appropriations. we do  wish. by that diversion. to be concluded of what we viewed as the priorities. in other words. there is prejudice either way. we have the right to fight about that in the usual manner. and this fact need  change the view of the ranking member of the committee on the budget. but i do  wish to sit silent and just accept that as the final disposition of the matter. i hope the senator will agree with me: what the budget committee proposes does  foreclose a senator or a group of senators on a committee from protesting what the committee on appropriations may do to change the order of priorities which the legislative committee thought was the right one. am i correct in that.
i understand that. but that is the committees choice. the senate may disagree with the committee. i am deeply committed to that research. too. and have been for years. but we have to have some balance in this thing and it is the committee on the budget that is trying to outline what we think are the legislative priorities. if the committee on appropriations tries to go its own way. do  take it out of us on education. we can still fight about it.
. that we may have to substantively amend this program when we deal with it legislatively. we may decide that 26 weeks is too long under present conditions. we may decide to cut it to 13. all of this will have an effect upon the amount of money which is required. which may or may  be included in this budget resolution. i advance that again to the managers of this bill so they may phrase their answer to my question. if we need to extend the program. will we or will we  have the budget authority.
. i appreciate what the senator has said. that if we add $500 million. the members are more than ready to spend it for something else. but is it  also true that this particular thing may be crowded out if we do  provide for it. because you are providing lots of other things within your budget ceiling. in order to maintain a deficit of $550 million. in other words. is there  a danger in misleading congress that it is  going to have to spend money which it may eventually find it is going to have to spend. is that  dangerous. and why pick out this item.
i point out to the senator that this $500 million. interestingly egh. fits exactly the reduction in revenue estimates made by the budget committee. the revenue estimate on the first resolution having been $362.5 billion and the revenue estimate on this resolution having been $362 billion. may i ask the senator. suppose that i would submit an amendment costing $500 million to extend the programand i will explain why it may be necessarywhat would be the attitude of the manager. here is the reason: there is a bill pending for permanent reform of the unemployment compensation system. that bill will come out of the committee on finance in about a week. the number is h.r. 10210. there are  too many vehicles upon which this matter can be dealt with. and i may choose to seek action to extend these benefits on that particular bill. . there are two questions there. first. i realize that the committee has a letter from the chairman of the finance committee. but the chairman of the finance committee has  traditionally initiated these unemployment compensation provisions. i have. and so i must say that the committee is by means the exclusive source. and the senate has gone along with those provisions by a very large majority before. and we have pressed them through conference. so i can simply say that because the chairman advised the budget committee he would  need the money. and that that is the end of the matter. because this particular chairman has  carried that ball before. i have. and i am frankly very much concerned about this omission. because it makes any amendment which may come between  and the end of this congress subject to a point of order. if i am wrong about that. i hope i will be corrected by the manager of the bill. because win. lose. or draw. it seems to me essential that this matter be dealt with affirmatively . if i am going to be faced with that kind of a situation.
. the reference i make is to the sentence in the report. on page 9. which reads as follows: the funds are to be used for the maintenance of basic services ordinarily provided by state and local governments. such as police and fire protection and sanitation services. it is to be borne in mind that this money will go to the communities in the country hardest hit by the recession. as the recession eases. it will be phased out. but a new factor has emerged that senator pastore has in mind. and it is necessary to have it on the public record. or i would have just filed my statement. yesterday. we concluded the conference on ceta. and one of the points of settlement on ceta. which is the public service employment program. was a provisionif i may have the attention of the senator. because it is really important. one of the provisions of the conference related to what will happen to jobs which are the subject of attrition  occupied under ceta. there are something in the area of 320.000 such jobs. the attrition. we decidedwith some conditions. but they are  important herewould be divided 5050 between municipal rehires for public health and safety purposes only and targeting to the longterm unemployed. when the senator has his conference on this bill. i hope he will have before him the text of the other bill. we are always accused of doing something with the right hand and  king what the left hand has done. i am informing the senator that these two ideas and these two pots of money have to be related to each other and coordinated. because they both concern urecisely the same thing. one of the reasons for the 5050 deal which i proposed was the contemplation of this very bill and this very appropriation. that would give more flexibility. depending upon what was available in each pot. but they must be coordinated. because they propose to do almost precisely the same thing.
let us remember we are  signing the bill into law. this bill is going to conference. and the thrust and purpose of this amendment has been made crystal clear. therefore. it seems to me that there is risk once we agree with the fundamental purpose of the amendment in adopting it because if it is imperfect in technical terms it can be perfected. the point is that we shall be sure because it is generally felt that there has been a very distinct lack of observance of discrimination provisions in respect to revenue sharing. the point is that this law shall bind up that loophole and we shall be sure that there is religious discrimination of the kind that we intend to deal with by law. i think the mover has made that crystal clear. senator brooke has. i am a cosponsor. i do. but the fact is that it should be adopted because it is high time we tightened this up over. above. and beyond what it was and such a fact be taken into consideration within the limitations that we have already laid down. we have already laid down the policy. and that is all. as i understand it. that is the intention of this amendment.
that. generally speaking. - has been the policy we thought existed. that they would award them. in the absence of that statutory policy. this is certainly one provision which the united states should insist on for all states as a condition for federal revenue sharing. . and i hope very much that it will be adopted.
. in answer to senator muskie. i would have objection. either here or in conference to make the plan effective so that it does  interfere with the budget we have adopted for fiscal 1977. i would gladly do it  or await the conference. in other words. to make this plan effective as of the new fiscal year of 1978.
i have desire to interfere with the budget resolution. . i ask unanimous consent that i may modify my amendment in accordance with the modification which i send to the desk. to have the date read "january 1. 1978."
. just to complete the argument on this. the policy which we have followed in respect of this recession has clearly been a very wise one and has had a lot to do with bringing us somewhat out of it. we are bringing down the coverage for unemployment compensation from 65 to 52 weeks. i respectfully submit that that is even  in proportion to the degree to which we have had a reduction in unemployment. it has worked well from the point of view of the fundamental ecoy of the country and we should  . because we are by means out of the recession yet. with a 7.9percent unemployment rate. precipitately cut it off from 65 to 39 weeks in one fell swoop. for that reason. i hope the senate will support this amendment.
s responsibility and his constitutional role to direct and manage the executive branch. it is likewise the responsibility of the congress to determine through the exercise of its oversight powers the degree to which the office of management and budget is carrying forward the extraordinary responsibilities which the. congress approved for it 7 years ago. i hope that the government operations committee in both houses will undertake this task at an early date. the legislation we introduce today should focus us on and facilitate consideration of these issues. by mr. stevens:
the senate appropriations subcommittee on labor/hew is holding hearings on the funding of the white house conference on library and information services. in the 94th congress. the committee reported a bill which included support for the conference. this bill passed the senate. but unfortunately the house had appropriation and the final measure contained funds for the white house conference. i urge my colleagues to again include this measure. which has also been endorsed by former president ford in his budget proposal submitted in january. i ask unanimous consent that my statement submitted to the appropriations subcommittee in support of the white house conference be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.
the second point which deserves e is that the budget resolution provides the necessary allowance for an extension of the federal supplemental benefits program for the unemployed. we are still experiencing an unemployment rate which is really intolerable and unacceptable. one of the great achievements of the previous administration. and which was joined in very strongly by the congress. was that president ford led in the feeling that a man who was unemployed. through fault of his own. if we humanly can avoid it should  be made to resort to welfare in order to keep his family together. and. therefore. he was entitled to the best we could do for him in unemployment compensation where he had a feeling of dignity and which came to him as a right. this program extended as long as 26 weeks. which we had in the federal state program. plus an additional 26 weeks. which we had in the federal programs. plus 13 weeks. by use of various triggers that has been brought down to a figure of roughly 52 weeks. i have introduced legislation to extend the program beyond march 31. 1977. when it expires by statute. the budget committee has accommodated the figures on that score and provided $508 million in the necessary budget authority and outlays. i point out. . i wish to commend the members of the budget committee for their foresight in including in the resolution before us provision of sufficient budget room for the startup of a youth employment title in the comprehensive employment and training act in fiscal year 1977. many bills have been introduced in this session of the 95th congressincluding s. 170. the comprehensive youth employment act. introduced by senator humphrey. myself. and others. s. 503. the youth employment act. introduced by senators mcclure. domenici. bellmon. myself. and other republicans. s. 1. introduced by senator mathias. s. 306. introduced by senators stafford. randolph. and others. s. 494 introduced by senator jackson and others. s. 20. introduced by senator cranston and others. and s. 680. introduced by senator
i thank the senator. therefore. it will be my objective. . the senate is very well capable of designing a suitable package which will be a credit to us. i ask the chairman of the committee on the budget and the ranking member whether or  they would approve of this method of proceeding as being in line with the general ideas which they had in giving us this availability in the budget so that we could move within an accepted budget figure.
we think it is adequate for the purpose. senator domenici does as well. and. obviously. senator muskie does. i believe we can fashion what is needed within the parameters of what the committee on the budget has done. i again express my deep feeling that the committee on the budget has served the country unusually well in this particular matter at this particular moment. our job will be to use the moment well. i thank my colleagues very much for their cooperation.
 sent us a message which consummates that effort. what i consider a most constructive. cooperative effort. between the executive and congress. i should like to pay my respects todayand i will do so again tomorrowand call attention of the country to the fact that the very danger which senator muskie so wisely foresawthat is. a race to the finsh line by the earliest bill on the scenehas been avoided through the statesmanship of these two fine senators. we will have an opportunity. together. to fashion a youth bill which i  feel very strongly will be a good one. as a separate item. with senator randolphs cooperation. the human resources committee. of which i have the ho to be the ranking miity member. has  provided $2.5 billion in our budget request to the budget committee to take care of this type of activity. we hear a great deal about things we do that are  right. here is something we are doing which is right and defies all the conventions about senators competing with each other. it is a fine example of working together to achieve a result in the most selfless possible way. and we owe the opportunity to senator randolph and senator stafford.
. this section relates to the study of certain provisions of the internal revenue code. and i ask the finance committee in consultation with the appropriations committee to study the point that we may deduct only $3.000 annually for our washington expenses even though we maintain two homes and most of us pay two or three times that amount in rent alone for the home that we maintain in washington. it is one of the real inequities in which we are very badly in my judgment considered under the income tax code. while i do  wish to get into debate about whether or  to do anything about it in this codeprobably it does  belong herei do believe that it should be studied by the appropriate committees. and we have a study section anyhow in this paragraph which is sought to be amended. we might as well include this item. which has been so long before us and we have never done anything about. perhaps the committees will enlighten us on the subject. i do  believe there is any objection to it.
the senator stands there and tells me. king this body as he doesand we have  even begun to consider the tax bill or any employment billthat we have plenty of time between  and september 30 to get retraining programs in place. . i just can believe it. i respect my colleague. but i have seen this body in operation a long time. we are going to have very few. if any more. training programs by september 30 than we have today. that is just common wisdom of my colleagues. i do  have to argue this.
i thank my colleague. we are going to have quite a basic difference of opinion as to what will get us going again. whether it is the $50 rebate or a permanent tax cut of the- rates. we shall fight that one out on aher battlefield. i thank the senator.
. i ask unanimous consent that the following members of my staff be granted the privilege of the floor during the debate on this bill: charles warren and james oconnell. as well as gary kuzina. of the budget committee.
. our purpose today is to discuss an amendment to the pending measure which will be introduced by senator danforth and myself and. hopefully. other sponsors. which provides for a permanent income tax cut in the inccme tax rates in the personal columns and for incomes. generally speaking. below $20.000. . we mean the adjusted gross income. the taxable income. upon which tax is paid. and this figure includes about 90 percent of all taxpayers and. at a given point in my stating my views upon this question. i shall lay out the various categories in which taxpayers are found. . the amount of the reduction is somewhere between 4 and 14 percent. depending upon the individual tax bracket. in dollar figures. the savings will run to something in the area of $200 a year in their taxes for the great bulk of the taxpayers. and it will. in a practical sense. have effect upon those whom we encourage as the "working poor." it will give them.back a kind of negative tax reimbursement. in accordance with recent laws which we have passed. the percentage distribution of this tax benefit is important. those who have enjoyed taxable incomes of $5.000 to $10.000 per year will receive 24.5 percent of the aggregate reduction. which will mean that those taxpayers in that particular bracket. who are  paying roughly a 19percent rate. under our plan will pay an 18 percent rate. taxpayers with incomes of $10.000 to $15.000 will receive 26.8 percent of the benefit of the tax reduction we are proposing here. they are mally  in the 22percent range for income tax purposes. and will be reduced to 21 percent. the taxpayers in the range of $15.000 to $20.000 will receive about 17 percent of the benefit of the tax reduction. and those in the $20.000 to $30.000 range will receive a comparable 17.5 percent. from then on. it diminishes to practically hing in terms of taxpayers having higher taxable incomes. the amount of the cost of the treasury which is involved here is an average of $6.2 billion for 1977 and 1978. and $7.9 billion in 1979. actual revenue losses in monetary terms will be $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1977 and 1978. as  a great part of those fiscal years will be included. and $10.2 billion when we get into the first fully realized year. which will be fiscal year 1979. so the aggregate cost for the rest of fiscal year 1977. which we are in . fiscal year 1978. and fiscal year 1979 is $12.4 billion. this is  after considering the reflows which occur by virtue of these tax cuts. these include reduced federal transfer payments and increased tax revenues generated by the tax reductions themselves. and hence the projected net revenue lossi have given the gross net revenue loss. which is $12.4 billionis $1.8 billion in 1977 and $7.1 billion for the next fiscal year. making a 2year total. which is as far ahead as we figured. of $8.9 billion. a very critical aspect of this matter is how it affects the individual family. and i would  like to detail that. we have combined in our amendment the effect of the present standard deduction increase. which will result. it is our understanding from the treasury. in about 90 percent of all taxpayers taking the standard deductionand. by the way. that is to be contrasted with about 70 percent . so there will be a very material increase in the number of taxpayers who will take advantage of the standard deduction. combining that. plus the effect of the rate cuts that we propose. we find. among taxpayers having taxable incomes of $8.000again. i repeat. that is adjusted gross income for tax purposesthere will be a total reduction in the existing tax at the lowest level of $210 per year. for those at $10.000. $263. for those at $12.500. $280. for those at $14.000. $247. and from that point on it diminishes. and we get down to the figure of $183 per year for those at $17.500. $198 per year for $20.000: at $25.000. $220. at $30.000. $220. at $35.000. $220. and at $40.000. $220. i ask unanimous consent that the table from which i have just read be printed in the record.
percentage cuts. of course. are very high in the $6.000. $8.000. and $10.000 ranges. and start at as high as 71 percent for $6.000. then they come down. at the $40.000 rate. to a 3percent tax cut. hence. the figures which i have. give a range of roughly 4 to 14 percent. on the average. s energy package. and in the continuation of an accepted. matter how we slice it. deficit of the order of magnitude of $50 billiondictates a reduction of this character. especially it is an essential element of our case that the history if this kind of tax reduction develops the proposition that more rather than less revenue will be engendered. indeed. we think the case is made very strong for the proposition that even if we engendered just about the same amount of revenue. the situation of our country demands this kind of approach. with that in view. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a schedule of individual income taxes reported in returns showing significantly the situation in tax reduction years and the situation in ensuing years. which is taken out of a report of the finance committee. report  9566. prepared as of march 28. 1977. i ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the record at this point.
that does show an extraordinary pattern going back to 1944 of tax reduction years and very interesting results as a result of tax reduction in terms of more individual income reported for tax purposes. . i believe the main reasons for our case are: first. the structural weaknesses which have been demonstrated in the u.s. ecoy. these structural weaknesses are slow growth in the gross national product. an absolutely sticky unemployment situation. which the government and the most optimistic forecasters do  predict will ease at all materially in the next 1. 2. or 3 years. and a persistent inflationary bias which. the moment you have a hard winter and take your eye off the ball for 5 minutes. results in doubledigit inflation and a ruis situa~ion for the united states with an unbelievablv deteriorating social. ecoic. and political effect on interest rates and on about any other standard that we coild have. because i think it is so critical. i ask unanimous consent that some ecoic forecasts from leading analysts of the wharton school and the chase bank be printed in the record. they illustrate. the danger which. i am describing for the period ending in the fourth quarter of
the fact is. . that is a structural element of unemployment of a first. character. other structural elements of unemployment are the presence. of jobs which require given kinds of training as our industrial machine is becoming more and more sophisticated. the location of those" jobs in given areas of the country. with a seeming inability to come- up with- the necessary training to equin people to occupy those jobs or to put people in. those areas of the country where those jobs are located. also. we have. by means. dealt with the demographic shift in the united states which also results in emous unemployment.. a shift in the civil. rights struggles in the fifties and the sixties from the south to the th: a shift from puerto. rico to industrial areasan important move out of cuba into the: united states when hundreds of thousands came here and found a place and found jobs. and comparable demogranhic shifts including the movement of a very large number of peole from mexico into the united states. because of depressed ecoic conditions there.
. i have heard with the greatest interest the views expressed by my colleague. the senator from massachusetts. i just wish to state the propositions he has made. as i understand them. i assure him that as the debate develops. we will address ourselves very thoroughly to those questions. one is that we do  affect by our amendment the inequities. in the tax code . one of the salient inequities is that married taxpayers. where both are working. fare worse because they are married than if they were single or living in sin. the second is that we increase the disparity and reduce the tax benefit of the poor when contrasted with those better off. because under this provision we are giving the reduction to essentially middle class taxpayers in a range of income subject to tax from $8.000 to $20.000. while the taxpayer in lower elements. including those who get a refund. stand still. they are  reduced. they are  increased. if i understand it correctlyi do  want to start. it this afternwe will deal with it next week.
i think i stated that. but i am glad the senator has said it in his own words. as i understand senator longs point. "if we give away the revenue . we will be unable to pass a tax reform bill later." i will deal with that. and so will my colleagues. as the debate resumes. i just wanted to spread that on the record so that those who read the record this weekend may look for the answers. though i think we have given them in our presentationssenator danforth and i. but we will do it again and specifically divert it toward these questions . and i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. the debate upon this amendment of senator danforth and myself has extended through a weekend which had some extremely portentous developments respecting the ecoic issues which are here concerned. this weekend saw a very drastic revision of the ecoic facts upon which the administration has based its position on this tax bill. in this connection. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an article detailing these facts. published in the wall street journal.
s own figures. the anticipations of the budget committee and the joint ecoic committee. the broad opinion of distinguished ecoic and business thinkers dictates that this is precisely the time and precisely the occasion to adjust the personal income tax rates of americans who are paying taxes in the true middleincome bracket. therefore. the proposal which we shall make in the form of an amendment should be adopted by the senate.
that is entirely correct. the savings which are incorporated. roughly in the order of magnitude of $225 to $250 per taxpayer. apply to taxpayers in relatively lowincome ranges. that is to say $8.000 a year to $12.500 a year. when we realize that for a family of four their aggregate income is $6.400 a year or less. they are in the poverty level. we can call such people affluent. yet so large are the taxes for that group that even a modest cut such as thb one we are describing in terms of their rates will reduce their taxes so materially. in the area. as i say. somewhere between 6 and 7 percent and 12 and 14 percent.
the .senator is 100 percent correct. we are deeply indebted to my collaborator. senator danforth.- a member of the finance committee who proposed the amendment which we will propose to the finance committee. who traced the history in terms of time lapse of the 1976 tax reform act. let us remember that when we talk about tax reform allegedly we just had a tax reform. dealing with the maximum tax. the minimum tax. in many other ways dealing with tax shelters. et cetera. it was a very. very complex law. as a matter of fact. only about a week ago in the new york sunday times a good deal of the financial section was taken up with the problems which had arisen. with the fact that in many cases regulations had  come out yet. with the fact that interpretations from the courts would take some years in order to deal with a specified section of that reform. as senator danforth so eloquently pointed out: that reform commenced in february 1973 with hearings before the ways and means committee. he said on page 11882 of the record: it took from february 1973 until october 1976. 3 years and 7 months. to enact into cxxiii757part 10 law what turned out to be the tax reform act of 1976. so to pretend for a minute that it is going to serve the national interest to defer what we are trying to do in this amendment until there is tax reform is simply asking us to guess absolutely blind and wild. in 1. 2. and 3 years the ecoic situation unquestionably will be radically different from anything we can see . indeed. the ecoic situation was so radically different between february and april that president carter. who had passionately pleaded for the rebate in februarythis is the one thing he was going to stand on. the one thing that was going to do wonders for the american peoplesaid in april. after saying that in february. that consumer confidence had  returned. the consumer was buying. and it was unnecessary to give the $50 rebate. then we get these revised figures which i have just given from the director of the budget. mr. lance. of the office of management and budget. again radically revising the whole forecast. again i repeat. when we say a 10percent revision in this ecoy. we are talking about over $100 billion in gnp. we have a gross national product of $1 trillion. which is $1.000 billion. it will probably be more in dollar figures in so the senator is absolutely right. first. it will take a long time. and second. as they say in the theater. what will be the situation then can only be dimly perceived darkly. that is hardly a standard by which to deal with the national interests of the people of the united states.
. the basic reqson for the bill is that the universities. libraries. and museums of the country are suffering from an existing provision of law which dates from 1969. before 1969. the law was general and broad. if an artist gave his work to a museum. the value of that work was a gift. just like any other gift. in 1969. the tax code was amended so that the artist was deprived of that opportunity. all a painter could deduct was the cost of his canvas and pqint. but the collector was  deprived of that opportunity. if he were a buyer of art and the value appreciatedlet us say he bought a painting for $500 and it became worth $50.000he could give that to a museum and get a full $50.000 charitable deduction. and he can do that today. so the law discriminated as between the man or woman who did the work and the person who acquired such a work. even if he acquired it from that very same artist. aher aaly in the law was if that artist died and his estate had to be valued for tax purposes. his estate had to pay an estate tax on the full value.  on the value of the paint and the canvas but on the full value. there is  much revenue loss involved. the estimate of the treasury department on my bill is about $5 million a year. it is an order of magnitude that. obviously. they can calculate exactly. but the consequences of this proposal of the ameican people are very great. let me just describe what has happened. the museums have suffered a drastic dimunition of gifts from artists. particularly those who have done contemporary work within this very same period from 1969 until today. i believe most of my colleagues have heard from museums precisely for that reason. let me give an example of the new york city museum of modern act. one of the great museums of the country. during the 2year period. 196869. the new york city museum of modern art received 125 donations by artists of their own works. in the 4year period. 197275. the museum received only 28 donations. in the critical and very valuable field of painting and sculpture. the reduction was from 42 works of art received in 1968 and 1969. to only one received in 197275. the artists feel very strongly about this as evidenced from a very interesting point. the national endowment on the arts. which we established. and i am very proud to have been one of its initiators. wrote a letter to senator long on april 29. 1976. stating these very considerations which i have described while commenting on an earlier version of this bill. i ask unanimous consent that that letter may be printed in the record.
. what do we have to offer the american people to achieve higher ecoic growth targets. we have a personal income tax rate cut to the very middleincome families. who produce the buyers of the bigticket items. the investors in securities. the professionals. the doctors. the lawyers. the engineers. that has worked before in tax cuts which have produced almost invariably more revenue than the cuts themselves have cost. we have submitted very adequate lists of the history of previous tax cuts and subsequent revenue receipts on that score. mr. healey is a very distinguished foreign visitor. a very keen observer. very highly hoed. he warns us about the very thing which we warn the senate about when we ask it to adopt this amendment.
i do  pose as a leader* of the republicans. but on this particular case it is a fact that the conference and the ranking miity member have chosen senator danforth and me to put forward the republican position. that is a fair statement. so i have a reaction to what the senator says. i agree with the senator. i do  believe that our side here will stand in the way of a constructive tax bill just because we can get what we think is best for the country. but i do think. too. that the president should draw a lesson from this. it would be superficial to say he really kind of jumped the gun in the statement that he is going to veto if this particular type of cut is put into a bill. in the first place. e of his three financial representatives would say that yesterday to the budget committee. on the contrary. they assiduously avoided it. and second. the president i think is in this learning process. and i am all with him and for him. i think the senator ks that about me very well. we want him to succeed because that means the country succeeds. i think this is part of the learning process. too. if we are needed. as the senator certainly assumes we are. in respect of a constructive tax bill. and we are  to clang the door shut because we do  get what we want. i think it is fair to say that a president should feel the same way and it would be superficial. and i would  argue it. when he changes his mind suddenly on the rebate he could easily change his mind on the veto. that is such a simplistic argument that it is unnecessary to make it. but i do think it is fair to say that we would have hoped the president would have said. "i am against cuts in the personal income tax rates the way they have been proposed. but as a president. as and if a bill comes to me and the time comes i will look it over and i will decide what i ought to do about it." i just mention that because i suppose we are all in a learning process. we will get along with a new president. and he has to get along with us. i really hope that as he reads thishe is  going to read this record. but he will hear about it and he will k what is going onhe too is instructed by it just as the senator from louisiana hopes that we are on this side of the aisle.
i thank my colleague. . i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an article entitled "public employment as fiscal policy." written by michael wiseman of the university of california. berkeley.
. let me put these facts into focus. the fact is that this bill goes back to 1971. during the depths of the recession. a good many of these employees were laid off. this is  a problem that affects new york city alone. it affects boston. philadelphia. omaha. san francisco. every city in the country. they could  hire them back because they did  have the resources. so we passed the bill. which had two titles. title ii dealt with the need for continuing municipal services for people who were unemployed. and. in addition. whose unemployment deprived communities of very basic services. they just could  continue without them. and we passed title vi to try to deal with a situation which we are debating here today to affect the aggregate of the unemployed. under title ii. of course. people were hired in order to perform these municipal services. but the bill before us has only 50.000 in that title. the main impact of this bill is title vi. that is what we are talking about having been completely reformed. therefore. the gao report and the congressional budget office report. which were related to the 1975 performance. are simply inapplicable. some may differ with us and may argue with us about the situation today. but these reports are irrelevant. the fact is that our chairman has put in the record a letter. written in 1976. as the program began to be reformed. from the congressional budget office itself. dated june 10. 1976. analyzing the situation which it complained about. that is. the socalled rehirings. that says--and it is right here. all are welcome to read it: it has been assumed that fiscal substitution will range between zero and 25 percent. based upon this approach which we are  describing. that is what we are debating. we are  debating the situation which was properly analyzed and found faulty. that. we have reformed. we are debating  the reformed situation. so if we are right or wrong on that. the fact is that the basic facts are different from what seems to be depended on in this amendment. to wit. a gao report and a congressional budget office report. they are both here. they relate to a previous situation.
the testimony is conclusive that the fastest way to put people in jobs is the ceta program. they can be put in jobs within 30 days. the reason is that the primary sponsors are in place. an activity is in place. and the vacancies are there. it is  a new program.
s energy proposal. in order to remove the uncertainties which the current debate on that proposal have engendered. at the same time. congress must demonstrate an understanding of the way in which inflation acts to inhibit ecoic expansion by reducing real earnings and inhibiting the incentive for businesses to expand and to hire. approximately 2 months ago. in its annual report. the miity members of the joint ecoic committee emphasized the need for ecoic policymakers to understand the incentive effects of policy actions. we emphasized that business does  invest. and people do  work. unless the returns on investment and work justify these actionsand that the curtailment of these returns by inflation tend to dry up supply and demand. these conclusions are compatible with chairman burns message that we must act promptly with regard to energy. and must still meet the inflation issue realistically. in order to remove the major disincentives for longterm ecoic growth. i welcome the federal reserve board chairmans wise counsel and commend his statement to my colleagues. i ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record.
just to confirm some figures. which i understand come out of the congressional budget office. they estimate that our unemployment rate in 1979 is going to be 6.3 percent. for example. chase ecoetrics predicts an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 1979. data resources. 6.6. the question i wish to ask the senatorbecause i. too. am strongly opposed to this amendmentis: is it  a fact that what really is being contested here is the nature of the budget process. the fact is that the budget committee has to make the very best estimate it can. that is our law. based upon this data which i have just mentioned. that and a good deal more. there is really hing else that the committee can do other than make the estimate which it haswhich seems to me. too. to be consonant with these figuresif anything. at the most optimistic. a shade less than what we are anticipating for 1977. it is tragic but true.
. i do  think the department can play ducks and drakes with us. they either do or do  have the authority to continue the programs they have . they asked for the money. they never expected that we would drop part g. etheless. it is being dropped in this bill. the departments answer. which came after the committee meeting. is completely inconsistent and exactly contrary to what we were assured by its representative. what i can understand is thisand i address this to my colleague who is managing the bill. he and i get along fine. we have had a marvelous relationship for all the years i have been the ranking member of this committee. i can understand what is so sticky about this. if the department says it does  have the authority. and that is very clear to mei am  an incompetent lawyer in reading a letterwhy can we  write something in the bill which will continue the authority. what is the big objection. and why are we having this fracas about it. i am  married to the particular language of my amendment. to the particular amountt or to the particular year. let us write into the bill the necessary provisioni will be happy to draft itwhich says that they may continue to do what they have been doing to assist children with learning disabilities. that is all i ask. that is the only objection to the bill. and i shall press this objection. because i think it is most unwise to surrender this authority. which is working well. for which the administration asked for money for fiscal year 1978. and for which money is provided up to . up to september 30. 1977. which involves a million handicapped children. i do  understand why this particular thing suddenly gets so sticky. that is why i have mentioned it in the direct presentation. rather than waiting until the amendment. frankly. i do  believe it should be necessary for me to have any difference with the manager of the bill on this question of an amendment.
i wish to associate myself with the remarks of the senator from west virginia and the senator from south carolina and to commend the magnificent dedication of senator randolph. senator stafford of vermont. and the staffs. in developing this legislation. i do  wish anything i have said or done about the amendment to detract from the luster which should attach to their names and their reputations for the magnificent effort that has been made. in the same connection. i think senator randolph will join me in expressing a debt of gratitude and appreciation. for the country and for the people of my state. especially the handicapped in my state. to the secretary of health. education. and welfare. mr. califa he has signed literally a charter of freedom. a bill of rights. in a set of regulations pursuant to a provision of law. of which i had the ho to be one of the authors. section 504 of the rehabilitation act respecting the fact that we should  in any way discriminate against the handicapped. but we should also implement that discrimination through effective actions. which can give them equality of opportunity through physical construction. opportunities for learning. employment. and standing in life. which has been so very long denied to them. i think that. in the same pantheon. we should place the name of joseph callfa who has issued these regulations implementing section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973.
the answer is yes. and  i would like to implement that answer with the following facts: we passed here  very long ago the ecoic stimulus act of 1977. that included $1 billion for the youth programthe very $1 billion which the senator mentioned. that left the situation neutral. because the committee. in its report. on page 14. said: for the youth program. the committee recommends $1 billion. the same amount as the house allowance and the budget figure. to fund the efforts for fiscal 197 and all of fiscal 1978. bear in mind that that is twothirds of the trenche. the other $500 million will come in a subsequent appropriation. so the matter is left neutral. therefore. we revert to the hearing of april 20 before the subcommittee on employment. poverty. and migratory labor of the committee on human resources. at page 32 of that transcript. i asked secretary marshall specifically about this matter. and i would like the senator to hear the colloquy. i will read it slowly: senator javits .... my last question is this: we have a fiscal stimulus appropriations bill before us. it has a billion dollars for youth employment programs. the thought originally was that this would go into title iii. socalled national programs for indians and various other special classifications. naturally. that is a large sum of money. we feel it is very. very urgently needed in the youth employment field. has the department thought at all about how that money can best be used and what assurance we should have as to whether it will be used consonant with this bill. or what are your thoughts on it. i beg the senator to e the words "consonant with this bill." which was the bill we were debating in connection with this testimony. secretary marshall. we have given a lot of thought to how it can be used. of course. the $1.5 billion in the youth bill reaching 200.000 young people is  insignificant. he was referring to an additional $1.5 billion. in addition to the $1 billion.
. i firnt thank senator dom.enici for his very gracious words about me and about the manager of the bill and the bill genei ally and then testify to the tremendous assistance which we have had from him. senator mcclure. and senator bellmton in respect of the creative aspects c f this bill at every turn. including their willingness to give a point here and thei e in order to bring about a bill today without an undue amount of confrontation... i have participated in the development of the language which is cortained in the amendment. and the amendment is acceptable to me. may i just say. so that the record is clear. my thought was that the secre.tary shall be the arbiter  any arbitrator. the arbiter and that. therefore. the use of the words on page 53 in the in sertion on line 11 "appropriate new clas sifications" leaves it to the secretary be. cause that paragraph provides assurances satisfactory to the secretary. s.: he may determine that they are or are  appropriate because the trade unions. i think. have quite a proper concern about moving people around in order to get lower rates of pay. and the suspicions engendered by the arguments over minimum wage. et cetera. always persist. we understand that. and it is our job as managers of the bill to look at both concerns and to try to deal with them the best way we can. so. the key concept is the fact that we vest authority in the secretary to be the arbiter as to whether such new classifications. occupations. and restructured jobs are really appropriate to attaining the objectives which are prescribed in this measure and especially in this particular paragraph. second. the word "received" is changed to the word "given." i can understand that perfectly because. after all. this is essentially a directed program to accomplish a purpose which the secretary is called upon to accomplish. as to the change which is made at page 63. to wit. to eliminate "in similar occupations." which to the proponents of the amendment is too broad a word. anything can be made similar. and so there is opportunity for some freedom of action or creativity in respect of the job opportunities which will be established for youth under this particular program. on the other hand. there is the fear of the trade unions that unless we use the word "similar" it will be construed as too restrictive and solely to the letter only what a particular job classification is defined as being by those who may be opposing the union again. trying to move people around and get them into lower or different classification. so again we have chosen language which is neutral and which leaves the secretary as the dominant factor in deciding the prevailing rates of pay for occupations and job classifications of the persons actually employed rather than any other standard as being the fairest determinant for the secretarys judgment.
. under the senate rules. i filed with the secretary of the senate on may 13. 1977. a "statement of contributions and hoariums" which discloses all contributions or hoariums received by me during the calendar year 1976. also it incorporates by reference all reports of campaign contributions which are on file with the secretary of the senate. these reports are public documents. in addition. on may 13. 1977. i filed. under the senate rules. with the comptroller general of the united states a "confidential statement of financial interests" which includes a list of my assets and liabilities in 1976 and my 1976 tax returns. as that report is  available to the public and as i have heretofore followed a policy of annual financial reports for some years. i am publishing a list of my assets and liabilities for calendar year 1976 as filed on may 13. 1977. the listing includes: first. each of my interests in property having a value of $10.000 or more. second. the assets held in a family trust established in 1937. of which i am the trustee and in which as a beneficiary i have a life interest. each item having a value of $5.000 or more. and third. each of my liabilities having a value of $5.000 or more. finally. i am including a summary of my 1976 federal income tax returns and the amounts of state and local taxes paid for 1976. i ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the record. there being obiection. the material was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows:
i understand this amendment will be accepted. i am  going to stand in the way of accepting it as a member of the committee. but i did think that the record should be kept clear so that it just does  look like we are being victimized here. in the first place. every percentage is under 25 percent that relates to the financing organization in this bill. except the international development association. second. if we did it on gross national product. the united states has 38 percent of the gross national product of all the aggregate ida dos. third. by an arrangement which has just been made. a special arrangement with certain other countries. our ida contribution actually will be 29 percent. so all of this is within reach of the figure which the senator has mentioned. as i say. i will  stand in the way of adopting this particular amendment. but i did think the record should be clear that we are  suckers. we are  being victimized. and the contributions have been declining. i have read the senators amendment with care. i appreciate very much the fact that he leads it off by emphasizing the importance of these international financing organizations because. in my judgmenti will deal with this on thursday in a rather extended speechwe face far beyond the billions-$5 billionthere are involved here. one of the gravest peacetime threats we have ever faced. it is apparently unrecognized. if we are going to be saved it is going to be these very international financing organizations that are going to have to do it. so. for all of the things that i have just saidas i say i will  stand in the wayi will accept this. but i did want to make it clear that we are  a people who are fuzzyheaded. or anything like that. and there are very good reasons for what we are doing and there has been a very measurable decrease over the years consistent with our efforts to bring down our percentage. i thank our colleague. f
i have only one correction for the education of our colleagues. $24 billion is the trade deficit. our actual deficit on that figure would be $10 billion because of socalled invisiblesinsurance. banking. payment of interest to american holders. et cetera. but it is a substantial amount.
obviously. it is  a solution. the solution is to make the debt good. but the possibility of takeover remains. it is contemplated by the banks themselves. in the final analysis. international agencies or the federal reserve will  see them frozen into this particular debt. but. as i said a minute ago. and i wish to repeat that. because i think it is very important. it is one thing to provide this kind of a backup. which is what it is. by an arrangement and agreement as. for example. adequate capital in the international monetary fund or by an agreement by all the central banks. including our own. it is a very different one when you get a 24hour call "come to our rescue." that means the worlds ecoic situation is tottering and could collapse. even if the money were forthcoming. and at that point it does become an operation which could be very dangerous to the taxpayers of the country. for those reasons i believe we have to be forehanded. i assure the senator that i am  sounding an alarm with point to it. the point is that we right  are in a recovery phase. and it is a fact that with our ecoy of $1.650 billion in gross national product. and with many other ecoies buttressing that laterally. these sums are  impossible. they can be handled. but they can be handled in a panic. they can be handled when the fire is burning in the house. they can only be handled if we are forehanded . and it is my deep conviction that we do  have an appreciationi am using that word in its military sense. and the senator has served. as have iwe do  have an appreciation of the danger or the size of the remedies which are required to head off that danger.
i hope that money is  going to be bad. but i do  see how they can do much more in terms of their own capital and surplus. domestic demand. and the attitude of the federal reserve board. therefore. i believe the world has to find aher way. and that is what i have been talking about this morning.
the present outstandings debts of the states in the amount of $4.6 billion compares with the combined costequalization grants for 1975 and 1976 in the amount of $6.9 billion. under the bill the grants must be used to repay outstanding loans. and any remainder will be credited to the states unemployment insurance fund. in addition. the bill would carry out the recommendation of a majority of the states. and which is already partially recognized in federal law. that the federal supplemental benefits program. fsb. be financed entirely from general revenues. the debt for fsb. the temporary federal program providing unemployment compensation benefits for longterm unemployed workers. is approximately $5 billion. in the emergency unemployment compensation extension act of 1977 enacted earlier this year. the congress adopted general revenue financing on a prospective basis. the bill we are introducing today will establish general revenue financing retroactively as well. thereby enabling the new .02 percent federal payroll tax increase enacted last year to be eliminated within 2 to 3 years. that tax increase was enacted to pay off the $5.3 billion fsb debt and the $3.5 billion debt due to the federal share of the extended benefits program. . the unemployment compensation reform act of 1977 has its provisions divided among three titles.
. the action of the senate on this amendment. which senator randolpr. with his customary fairness. has interposed before mine so that the senate could act on that first. becomes criticg.llv important. i hope very much that the senate will reject that amendment and leave the terminal date for the tax in the bill.
precisely because the history has shown it does  do what the senator claims. the very same people are constantly before us saying. "reduce the minimum wage. eliminate the minimum wage. and well give more employment." it just does  happen. the most authoritative study of the department of commerce. which i have placed in the record. indicates we lose as many adult jobs as we get youth jobs. and that is the very best face that can be put on it. the reason i say what i do. and so strongly and firmly. is because this is hing but a way of getting out of the struggle we have been fighting in chambers like this for years. we will  face the issue that in order to train people we have to pay for their training. i prefer to pay for it in private business. this is  going to do it all. all we are doing is giving ourselves a placebo with this amendment to enable us to get a couple of years more in order to point out we are in the same place we are in today. i believe the senate has properly turned that treatment down and i hope it will on this amendment. as well.
. hud agrees with this proposal. and the ways and means committee of the other body has reported out a bill containing a similar 1year extension. the treasury agrees to it. within the last few years. this provision has resulted in about 80.000 units of low- and moderateincome housing being rehabilitated that would  have been rehabilitated otherwise. prior to that time. that is. prior to 1969. only 15.000 units were rehabilitated. and we believe that this provision in the law has had a very heavy influence upon rehabilitation of lowincome housing. the joint committee on internal revenue taxation has recommended. of course. a 5year extension. we are seeking only 1 year. with the cost to range from $1 million in 1977 to a high of $5 million in 1980. with the 1978 cost estimated to be $4 million. we in the slumridden cities believe this to be very helpful. and since it is already in the law and this is strictly a matter of an extension. i would hope very much that the managers of the bill will see fit to accept it. we do  k how many bills will be in conference between  and the end of this session. but this is a bill which undoubtedly will be.
the house did. that is true. except there are two points here. one. the gas tax is advantageous in terms of btu content. which it reaches. and second. the fact that this tax is targeted upon a particular group. which is the most susceptible to the-
may i finish. the most susceptible to the fact we are seeking to attain by the tax. therefore. i tend to favor it because. although it is higher. and i will  dispute that with the senator. it is targeted in a way which the administrations tax is .
i respond to the senator as follows: in what i said this morningi am sorry if the senator was  in the chamberi was addressing myself to the metzenbaum amendment on boiler tax and user tax. the senator is talking about the jackson amendment.
. chairman burns has been a dedicated servant of the american people and as chairman of the board of govers of the federal reserve system has provided outstanding leadership in dealing with the severe ecoic issues facing the nation today. i commend to my colleagues this speech and request unanimous consent that it be printed in the record:
i understand in the other body there was a colloquy between congresswoman holtzman and the manager of the conference report which related to the transfer of certain moneys both for fiscal year 1977 and future years for additional costs for administration. as my own state would qualify for some of the 1977 money. the question arises of the degree to which there had been proper servicing in new york in the summer lunch program. congresswoman holtzman has been extremely critical of the administration of the summer lunch program.
i thank the senator. may i say one further thing about the federal reserve item. many of us felt. and it was secret. that the big issue in terms of the worlds financial stability involved whether or  the president acts to reappoint dr. burns or whether he takes some other course. again. i hope that the president will realize the seriousness of his decision in terms of its impact upon the world of business and finance. this is a very important question. i hope very much the senate and the president will realize the weight. the importance. which will be attached to his decision.
i have heard the statement made by the senator. whom i  only respect but love. about the federal reserve and the actions of its chairman. dr. burns for whom senator humphrey has very. very high regard. i believe that the federal reserve was heavily at fault in what occurred. most of us k that there are many other factors including the lower productivity of the american industrial machine as compared to other countries of the world. i believe. however. that it is only fair that dr. burns should have his day in court. i. therefore. state. without engaging in a debate here. that because senator humphreys speech was very well prepared. as is his wont. the reply should be equally well prepared. i shall submit this address to dr. burns and ask him to give me a reply which i will offer for the record or perhaps read as senator humphrey has read his statement. may i say. too. i am just delighted. senator humphrey. that you had the spirit and the initiative to analyze this situation and to make this very thoughtful. very interesting. and very provocative speech today.
. today senator packwood and i are introducing legislation to eliminate a substantial disincentive to lifelong education of workers. our bill would amend the internal revenue code to provide that tuition paid by an employer on behalf of an employee would be taxable as income to the employee. under present law tuition paid by an employer is taxable to the employee unless the training or education is to improve or maintain skills needed in the employees work or is specifically required by the employer or by applicable laws or regulations. this standard gives rise to inequitable administration. adds to the complexity of our tax system. and acts as a major disincentive to continuing education. particularly among those at the lower end of the ecoic scale. because significant ambiguities exist in the "improve or maintain skills" test. the taxability of educational assistance programs of the employer can depend on a revenue agents view of the skills needed for a job. further inequities can result merely from whether the course is taken at an accredited institution or . this unfortunate aaly results because. under present law. even if the course improves or maintains required skills. educational assistance is deemed income if the course also qualifies the employee for a new trade or business. take the case of an accountant enrolled in law school courses needed to improve skills in his present job. because graduation from an accredited law school is generally a prerequisite for taking the bar. if he takes the courses at an accredited law school. any reimbursement by the employer is treated as income. however. if he takes the necessary courses at a accredited law school. he will  be taxed on any reimbursement because he is  simultaneously preparing for a new trade or business. present law also adds to the complexity of our tax system.  only must the service use valuable personnel time in making determinations of taxability. but employees and employers must then justify their positions. and initially. the employer must determine whether to withhold for tax purposes when reimbursement is made. many employers have simply elected a blanket withholding for all employees. a policy which is patently unfair to the employee. others have elected to deal with possible ambiguities on a casebycase basis. which increases costs in terms of personnel and time to the employer. and opens the employer to fica and futa penalties if the employers determination differs from that of the internal revenue service agent handling the audit. still other employers do  withhold at all on tuition payments on the basis that. by definition. all courses maintain or improve skills required by the present position. because employees whose employers withhold are three times less likely to participate in education assistance programs than those whose employers do . the decision of the employer becomes a major consideration to an employee thinking about continuing education. more serious even than the inequities of administration and the complexities of the tax law is the disincentive to upward mobility. while we stress the need to provide greater access to educational and ecoic opportunity to those who have had limited access in the pastmiities. women. the poor. and the handicappedwe simultaneously require outofpocket tax payments from those least able to pay. even though they receive only services.  an increased paycheck. for example. a single taxpayer who earns $10.000 lives in new york city. and uses the standard deduction would pay an additional $342 in federal. state. local. and social security taxes on a tuition reimbursement of $1.000. the same employee earning $15.000 would pay an additional $448. and if the employee earned $20.000. the additional tax bite would be $492. for a married taxpayer who was the sole wage earner with two children. the additional federal. state. and local taxes at the three income levels. again with $1.000 in tuition reimbursement. would be $300. $350. and $381. these amounts represent taxes actually paid to the federal. state. and local governments. the amounts withheld during the year. however. often are a higher percentage of the tuition reimbursement than is necessary to meet a taxpayers yearend tax obligation. one major new york city employer has a policy of withholding a set percentage of tuition reimbursement matter what tax bracket the employee is in. for its convenience and to ease the paperwork burden of computing withholding in each separate case. to determine the impact on lower income employees of taxation of educational assistance programs. i asked this employer to provide me with a sample of withholding for seven employees utilizing its tuition assistance program. withholding for these seven was about 33 percent. despite the fact that actual taxes due computed to a smaller percentage of income. these were  highsalaried employees. but employees earning $8.000 to $15.000 a year. to a person earning $9.500. an outofpocket payment for taxes of $748 on a $2.285 reimbursement is a tremendous sacrifice and only adds to the burden of the time and effort required to pursue further education. i ask unanimous consent that a chart ment. and taxes withheld of these seven employees be inserted in the record at this place in my remarks:

programs and then makes them more costly to the employer through additional fica and futa taxes and less attractive to the employees through increased witholding. furthermore. the employer often loses credibility with its employees. who feel the employer is  talking straight by encouraging them on the one hand to take courses and then withholding moneys from the tuition reimbursement on the other. explaining that the employer must withhold by law does  insure acceptance by the employee. for employees often blame the employers for the taxes withheld. the bill senator packwood and i are introducing today would eliminate this major disincentive to continuing education by expanding the exclusion from gross income to include any educational assistance made by the employer. whether paid directly to the educational institution or to the employee as reimbursement. or furnished "inhouse" by the employer. any moneys for books. fees and other similar payments would also be excluded from gross income. but meals. transportation. or lodging paid by the employer would be taxable. unless. as under present law. the training improves or maintains job skills or is required by the employer. to avoid abuse of this expanded taxfree treatment of educational assistance programs. antidiscrimination rules are included in the bill. for educational assistance  tax exempt by present law. more than 25 percent may go to officers or owners of more than 5 percent of outstanding stock.  may these educational assistance payments discriminate in favor of highly compensated individuals or those with certain levels of prior education. but. an employer may require successful completion of courses or attainment of specified grades in courses before it makes education assistance payments. the cost of the proposed change is  greatless than $25 million. but the greater access to educational advancement and the resulting greater productivity of our nations work force is well worth the price. education has been perceived as largely a terminal kind of developmental process--essential to help youth develop into mature adults. but unnecessary once life skills have been acquired. but human development is a continual process. it does  end at adolescence. this is especially true in our world of rapid techogical change. we must encourage.  discourage. american workers to continue to meet the challenges of our changing society through continuing education. this bill we introduce today is an important step in lowering the barriers to further education. by mr. metzenbaum:
i say to my chairman that it is very much in line with arthur burns thinking. arthur burns has come to be considered an ecoic conservative because many believed that he worshipped the curbing of inflation. whatever its social effects in terms of unemployment this is quite unfair. on the contrary. what arthur burns was saying was. "let us have the strongest possible posture in which we can have the greatest leverage on the world ecoy. because. if we are weak and in disarray. then we will have committed the worst sin of all." there was hing in arthur burns that lacked humanity. although a fiscal conservative. he advocated that the u.s. government be the employer of last resort and that person in the united states. who was willing and able to work. should be without a job even if the government had to finance it. this is certainly  a conservative doctrine. i believe that he is probably the most respected financial authority in the world of modern times and its leading central banker and that he leaves the federal reserve with that reputation very deeply established.
that is exactly the point i am trying to make. i am a liberal and am very humanistic in my approach. i believe that our country can afford to take care of its distressed people. but i also am very mindful of the fact that right  we face a very deep structural difficulty in the ecoy of our country. in terms of jobs. the endemic unemployment and the endemic inflation simply do  belong in a country as rich and productive as ours. president carter wanted to give $50 to the poor. the poor would rather have a job. and a steady job. than a $50 tax rebate. we have to bear that in mind. i do  think that the trickledown theory is facing today that it is immoral. the fact is that right  we need these jobs. and we need american business to produce them. i believe people are  willing to cooperate toward that end. therefore. i see a very real opportunity for an intelligently drafted investment tax credit which will be higher than that  granted. provided it is targeted toward new development. the removal of obsolescence. and new production in the right kind of business sectors. also. i believe we will see a willingness to give greater accelerated depreciation. in many countries. it can be as much as 100 percent in the first year. they could  care less what you deduct. because thereafter you have to pay taxes on the value of that machinery and what it produces. what we need is new thinking. unfortunately the tax cut which the president so far has proposed represents old thinking. the image is constantly invoked of 1960. when jack kennedy had a tax cut and the ecoy turned around because of that tax cut. the 1960s are  1978. and the remedies can be the same. because the remedies worked then. it does  necessarily mean that they are going to work . president carters suggested tax cut is a sizable slice of moneyat the very minimum. $25 billion and probably as high as $34 billion. that is  what the american people need right . they need jobs and they need an ecoy that inspires confidence. those are my feelings about tax cuts. and that is why i raised the issue as i did. because i think it is necessary to get politicians to think in other terms. the people are  so simplistic that you are going to buy them off with a tax cut. when they k in their hearts that that is  the proper remedy for a trouble that is caused by deep defects in the ecoy which  need to be corrected. if we are to have a bright future.
i thank the senator. we have the privilege of amendment in the u.s. senate. including amendments to tax bills. and i hope we will have the courage to followthrough on what we believe. i thank the senator from rhode island very much for his approbation of the issues i am presenting. one does  have to agree with the solutions or all of them. the fact is. that it must provoke our thinking and our action. and the senator from rhode island has exactly defined my purpose. i do  have the remotest pride in my authorship of solutions. but i do have emous pride in my deep feeling about the fact that there is something deeply wrong that is seemingly going uniced in this country. i am deeply grateful to the senator. as i am to other senators who have spoken today. for supporting that proposition. in order to arouse our people and especially those in authority who bear the responsibility.
. we have had full employment in our country on a few occasions in the postwar period. most of these periods have coincided with war and they have all been short lived. these periods have been elusive because we have  had coordinated and planned national ecoic policies. we have stumbled upon full employment. so to speak. and sometimes in spite of ourselves. so we have enjoyed some sporadic episodes of full employment. but we have  had the balanced ecoic growth that could make it last. i believe we can achieve sustainable full employment as a result of balanced ecoic growth and indicative ecoic planning. and this is what can flow from the humphreyhawkins bill. i hasten to add that i am  referring to the soviet or chinese approaches to ecoic planningthese are inconsistent with our system of private enterprise and ecoic freedom. what i am -eferring to is the kind of planning that is practiced by general motors. exxon. a.t. & t.. ibm. and about every other wellrun business in the united states. the humphreyhawkins bill can enable us to establish a framework in which the executive branch and congress can formulate national ecoic goalsparticularly full employment goalsand coordinate ecoic policies and programs to achieve balanced ecoic growthbut acting on each measure advisedly. once we have agreed on the goals and have our path before us. we can consider policies and programs in a coordinated manner and move better toward full employment. for this reason. i am thoroughly in agreement with the principles embodied in the humphreyhawkins bill and i intend to do all i can to have it passed in the senate. i understand that some senators. while sympathetic with the objectives of the humphreyhawkins bill. have serious reservations about one or more of its provisions. i must confess that i. too. have some reservations about some of the provisions in the bill. i feel. for example. that the numerical goal for full employment may be inconsistent with the objective of balanced ecoic growth. but i believe we can agree on a provision that can be accepted by a majority of senators. therefore. i believe we can enact a full employment bill. one that emphasizes the need for sustainable full employment and establishes the framework for an ecoic goalsetting process in order to get us there. and once we put the planning process into place. we can begin at long last to have coordinated ecoic policymaking in our country. and then we may be able to have the kind of balanced ecoic growth that leads to full employment.
. during the easter recess i visited turkey and greece. under the auspices of the committee on foreign relations. on may 1. 1 circulated a copy of my report on this trip to the members of the commitee. in anticipation of the committees may 2 hearing on the administrations fiscal year 1979 request for assistance to greece and turkey. inasmuch as i believe that my report may be of interest to other senators also. i ask that the text of my report be printed in the record. the text of the report follows:
i think senator moynihan has very well put our situation. i have been here a long time. i have certainly  been a party to the profligacy and what has brought us to this point. but here we are. as he says. and i adopt everything he said on that subject. there is one thing. though. i do wish to emphasize to my colleagues. and that is new york is a revenue producer. and that i think is a critical point. it is one of the really great revenue producers of this country and can do a great deal more especially as today there is an emous influx of foreign interests in new york city. it seems to be a city very congenial to people who come from abroad. only as one indication. and i think you all k this as you mix in the same circles i do. the market for cooperative apartments in new york has literally turned upside down in the last 2 years. therefore. it remains a very advantageous gateway. and i think there is a great national interest  only in the ways that have been described by my colleague. senator moynihan. who senator byrd has quite properly said is very giftedwe are very lucky to have himbut also in terms of what it means to our country financially. it will take decades. perhaps a century. to recreate aher such center and it is the preservation of that. also. which i think is of very great national interest. but i k my colleagues will be extremely judicious about what is done and i have agreed with that before and. indeed. undertook solemnly in the senate in 1975 when we last acted on our responsibility for new york city over. above. and beyond. what the senate mally does. and pat moynihan has joined me in that. we have gone to many meetings. we have prevailed against possibilities of wastage. and i think it is the current record. as well as the past record. which is bad. but it is the current record. also. upon which new york deserves to be judged. i hope that. when the senate acts on this matter. it will evaluate these factors as well.
. let me read the figures from the following table. these are the most instructive of any. united states. 2.1 percent. second in line. united kingdom. 2.6 percent. canada. 2.8 percent.  let us take some of the successes and see how we stand with them. germany. 6 percent6percent improvement in productivity currently as against its preceding figuresand japan. 5.5 percent. even italy is 5.5 percent. withstanding the tremendous disorder in the country. and france is 4.9 percent. which is more than double the productivity improvement in the united states. productivity growth in manufacturing (197076) country: percent united states --------------------- 2.1 canada --------------------------- 2.9 japan --------------------------- 5.5 france -------------------------- 4.9 germany ------------------------- 6.0 italy ----------------------------- 5.5 united kingdom -------------------2.6 denmark ------------------------- 6.8 sweden -------------------------- 3.9 switzerland ---------------------- 3.5 (source.-u.s. department of labor. bureau of labor statistics. office of productivity and techogy.) moreover. the united states ranked highest among the large industrial nations in the sixties. u.s. productivity. therefore. has deteriorated both absolutely and relatively to that of its trading partners. a fact that can only have serious adverse implications for both the domestic and international ecoic positions of the united states.
. yesterday i inserted in the record an editorial from the new york times outlining the arguments in favor of quick senate action on the united statesunited kingdom tax treaty. today the wall street journal joins the new york times in urging that the senate approve the treaty. in making its case. the wall street journal focuses on the effect that the treaty will have in increasing foreign investment in the united states and on the benefits that will accrue to united states investors in britain under the treaty. i reiterate my call for prompt senate action on the treaty. i commend the editorial to my colleagues and request that it be printed in the record. the editorial follows:
. it has been my practice and policy during the last 10 years to publish a report of my financial situation. . for the first time in the history of this body. senate rules require that certain financial information about senators be made available to the public. yesterday. under these new senate rules. i filed with the secretary of the senate two financial reports. which are public documents. the first form is the "senate public financial disclosure report". which includes a list of my assets and liabilities as of january 1. 1978. the second form is the "statement of contributions and hoaria" which discloses all contributions and hoaria received by me during the calendar year 1977. this form also incorporates. by reference. all reports of campaign contributions which are on file with the secretary of the senate and which are public documents. in addition. i filed under these senate rules. with the comptroller general of the united states. a "confidential statement of financial interests". this statement includes a list of my assets and liabilities during the calendar year 1977 and a copy of my 1977 federal tax return. as this report is  available to the public and as i have heretofore followed a policy of annual public financial disclosure. i am publishing a list of my assets and liabilities for calendar year 1977 in accordance with the form i have used before. the listing includes: first. each of my interests in property. second. the assets held in a family trust established in 1937. in which as a beneficiary i have a life interest and my wife and children have a remainder interest. third. each of my liabilities. and finally. i am including a summary of my 1977 federal income tax return and the amounts of state and local taxes paid for 1977. i submit these items for the record.
i would like to repeat particularly these closing sentences: it would be extremely unfortunate. in my view. if the senate were to enter a reservation on article 9(4) or otherwise fail to ratify the proposed united kingdom treaty as it stands. a reservation would require that the treaty be sent back to parliament for reconsideration. after a review of the new balance of concessions in the revised treaty. parliament might enter reservations of its own. which would be costly to u.s. investors. the treasury. and the states. moreover. further delay in achieving ratification could do considerable damage to our efforts to reach satisfactory international tax agreements with other countries. for these reasons i respectfully urge that you vote for senate ratification of the proposed treaty. . 
. have all steps in respect of the tax convention with the united kingdom as listed on the executive calendar. the first protocol and the second protocol. preliminary to a final vote on ratification been completed. either actually or by unanimous consent.
i would like to read to my colleagues from a letter that assistant secretary designate ulrich answering the concerns about the effect of the treaty on the ownership of u.s. farmland: the proposed treaty does  in any way create a tax preference for foreign ownership of u.s. farmland. the proposed treaty contains provisions specifically addressed to the taxation of farmland. the treaty does provide in article 6 that all u.s. real property income is taxable in the united states under mal federal tax rules. this would include income derived from farmland. the treaty most certainly would  prevent the states from taxing farm income. as explained in secretary blumenthals letter. there are a few limited situations where pursuant to article 9(4) of the proposed treaty states may  use the socalled unitary method in taxing profits. at the present. there are only three states that would be affected by article 9(4)-california. alaska and oregon. in the limited situations where the unitary method of taxation may  be used. the states are allowed under the treaty to use the arms length method of controlling prices in transactions between related parties. there is a wide market for agricultural products and it is. therefore. very easy to obtain arms length prices and to avoid any possible shifting of profits. moreover. federal audit information is available to state tax authorities for the purpose of determining an arms length price. we understand that the concern with respect to the taxation of farming profits is primarily directed at japanese interests and  the united kingdom. of course. the proposed treaty with the united kingdom does  in any way relate to japanese investment. aher argument with respect to the treatys impact on farmland is that the treaty would somehow prevent the states from requiring that farmland be owned by domestic corporations or domestic persons. this argument is totally incorrect. the proposed treaty does  contain any rules affecting state laws with respect to the rights of foreign persons to own u.s. farmland or any other type of land. although there is a discrimination article in the proposed treaty. this article only applies to federal and state laws with respect to taxation. the discrimination article in the proposed treaty is the same in this respect as discrimination articles already contained in our current treaty with the united kingdom and sixteen other u.s. taxtreaties. e of those treaties require the states to alter any rules with respect to land ownership. . i ask unanimous consent that i may have a quorum call with the time to be charged equally to both senator sparkmans time and mine.
. we have 90 million people employed in this country. 90 percent of them are employed by american business enterprises. i fail to see how populism can fail to include the employers as well as the employed. that is the only way that jobs can be created. i value senator percys support for this treaty. with all respect. i think he is just as populist minded. and his area of the country is just as populist minded. as our distinguished colleague from idaho and his region. but he has business experience and he ks what makes the merrygoround. i value very much. therefore. his support of the treaty.
. i happen to be a fan of alaska. i think i have done many things. i hope. in my lifetime and here in the senate i may do many more to aid our outpost state in order to develop its fantastic potential. i would  for a moment try to overween the senator by countering his arguments in some confrontational way. but i would like to point out a number of things which could be helpful. that is the reason i express them. first. alaska is an emous area that needs eomous investment.  that i am trying to convince the senator. but i simply wish to commend to the senator. who is probably the most patriotic advocate one could find of his state. the experience and study made by both the gover of california and the gover of west virginia. i think before the senator was in the chamber this morning i read mr. rockefellers letter respecting west virginia. and it was very instructive as to what he said. west virginia started out against it and ended up for this treaty. i would like to reread. if i may. that paragraph. it has gone into the record: we estimate that the treaty prohibition on the use of the unitary tax system would reduce corporate tax revenues by approximately $300.000 annually. however. in reviewing the aggregate impact of the treaty. i am  confident that the tax gains to west virginia by reason of the treaty should more than offset this loss. comparable experience is interestingly reported by gover brown of california. again. i would like to refer to the telegram which gover brown sent. joined in by senator cranston. this morning senator hayakawa spoke to exactly the same point. the telegram said: furthermore. it is the judgment of californias business and transportation secretary. richard silberman. and the state director of finance. roy bell. that ratification of the treaty will have a positive net ecoic impact on california. i would like to give the senator an example of this point. the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation had an interest in a california branch. one of the horror stories about the applications of the unitary tax system by california was to this hong kong and shanghai banking corporation holding. apparently. the state of california taxes them more than their capital because of the unitary system. i understand that  that they have acquired an important interest. perhaps as much as a controlling interest. in the marine midland bank. they are more than happy to sell their interest in their california holding. . in addition. this treaty. as the senator ks. is heavily supported by business interests which do very broadscale investing. finally. the senator is right about the fact that the united states expects that the countries of the european ecoic community. will be adopting the same tax integration system that the united kingdom has already adopted and hence that we can expect that there will be an extension of this principle in other treaties. undoubtedly. with france. the german federal republic. and possibly canada. finally and very importantly. the treasury. and i  make this part of the record and legislative history. the treasury has sought to put to rest the fear that article 9(4) is merely a first step toward greater federal restrictions on state taxing authority. particularly that a provision like article 9(4) will be included in other treaties and that future treaties will go beyond the limited scope of article 9(4) to impose greater restrictions on state taxation. with regard to the second point. treasury has intention of limiting state taxation in future treaties. beyond the type of restrictions provided in article 9(4). . the second point is that future treaties will go beyond the limitations of 9(4). so they negate that. with respect to the first point. that a provision like 9(4) will be included in other treaties. treasury has taken the position in discussions with other countries that a provision like article 9(4) can be considered until the senate has acted on the united kingdom treaty. if the treaty is approved. treasury will consider the inclusion of similar provisions in other treaties. but only in return for commensurate concessions on the other side. the treasury does  want to expand the concept beyond these limitations. and i think that is an important commitment to a state like alaska. if the reservation is rejected. which i cxxiv- 1174part 14 hope is doneand i shall do my utmost to bring it abouti hope the state of alaska. one. will hold the treasury to this promiseand i will help the state of alaska. and i think the senate will. and. two. that the state will do its utmost to take advantage of a new climate for investment to attract rather than repel foreign investment.
both senators of california. have started where the senator is. have changed. with the gover. and one other thing: the senator is quoting something which i have to challenge and challenge very seriously. he quoted the congressional budget office.
the letter said: the congressional budget office estimates that the 5year cost of the treaty provisions other than those related to the act and prt in millions of dollars will be the act is the payback. we are getting over $375 million back. and that is going to be taxed and it is going to be taxed retroactively. and in addition we are getting $85 million a year which will also be taxed. the senator did  say anything about those offsets. then let us read on from column 1 which says: fiscal year 1978 revenues loss. $100 milion. then it takes a precipitous drop in 1979 to $28 million. in 1980 to $31 million. in 1981 to $35 million. in 1982 to $40 million. and in 1983 to $45 million. if anything it is a washout. with what is coming back under act and the other advantages of the treaty it has been egh to convince twothirds of the foreign relations committee and to bring onto the floor only those senators. i wish to point out. who represent states that wish to use the unitary tax system. . let me pay my respects to the fisheries and the farmlands and all the other dust that is thrown in the air. as a matter of fact. you can make any tax you please upon any corporation. u.k. corporation. which does business in your community. any tax you please. even confiscatory. unless you are stopped under the constitution. there is hing to prevent you from taxing their business for fishing vessels. their business for farmlands. and their property in the state. under the treaty. the states will  be able. as some have done  under the unitary tax system. to reach out and tax them for property they have and business they do all over the world by an arbitrary proportion of whatever they do in your state. whether there is property there. business. or anything else. that is the reason why the british and other industrialized nations properly protest against this unitary taxing system. the united states has negotiated a treaty. it has negotiated many others affecting taxation. senator pell cited one on shipping. reference to which will be found here at page 187 of the record. of the foreign relations committee hearings on the treaty. our existing treaty of friendship. commerce. and navigation with france specifically provides that french companies can be taxed by our states except with respect to property located in such state. income or property derived from activities within that state. or business which the french companies do in that state. that is. in essence. a discrimination article. and we have those in every tax treaty. so there is discrimination and you are  making a tax haven. you can tax them any way you please. but you have to tax them realistically. you have to tax them on property or business done in that particular state.
we will get to canada in a minute. the senator mentioned the soviet union. and that is typical of his argument. he is assuming that the armslength tax method is unfair and that is why we need the unitary tax system because the senator is unwilling to tax-
if i may just finishyou are unwilling to tax only upon business done or property owned in your state. and  about canada. i said. if i may just finishand by the way we have to stop because of other members.
madam president. i hope the senate realizes that what we have done is very serious. we have for all practical purposes eliminated a very important provision of this treaty for which the united kingdom believed it had entered into the treaty. for all intents and purposes it was for the british the critical balance contained in the treaty. the united kingdom considers the unitary tax systemmadam president. may we have order.
madam president. the united kingdom considered article 9(4) the quid pro quo for a very large retroactive refund of about $375 million and an annual prospective refund of about $85 million to american investors. these sums. which would return to the united states are very meaningful to the u.s. treasury. i regret. madam president. that the british considered that the quid pro quo for providing relief to u.s. investors was this provision which would have limited application of the system of unitary taxation by a few states which the british regarded as very onerous and invidious to them. the senate decided that that reservation was inappropriate and defeated it. but the opponents. those who proposed the reservation. succeeded-
i thank the chair. those who proposed the reservation succeeded in getting egh votes. since they only needed onethird of the votes to defeat the treaty. withstanding that the treaty itself ha.d a very heavy majority of the senators voting. . you really have to understand the processes of the senate and the constitutionand i may say that the british doto come to understand that result. so. withstanding the fact that a decisive majority of the senate is for this treaty in all its elements. it was etheless defeated. it is my information that this treaty will be resubmitted to the british parliament. what the british parliament will do with it i do  k. but i rise this morning because our voices will be heard in the united kingdom. and my own opinion is. and the opinion of the great majority of the senate was. that it is an entirely fair deal. that the few states which were using the unitary taxation system would be losing very little. and that the overall national interest of the united states dictated ratification. that is the way the majority of the senate felt and. indeed. the state of california. the largest state that would be a beneficiary of continued global application the unitary tax system. through its two senators who voted for ratification. and its gover who advised us that he thought on balance it was in the high ecoic interest of his state. supported ratification of the treaty without a reservation. therefore. i hope. madam president. that the members of parliament will see the situation as we see it. and that they will accept the treaty. on the ground that a majority. a heavy majority. of the senate feels as they do. i also hope that the british will negotiate aher treaty or a protocol with the united states to deal with such elements of their tax situation as they consider to be fair. obviously. a new protocol can be as complete as was contained in this treaty. etheless. i hope very much that just like we kept the matter open. and as i. the strongest advocate of the treaty in the senate voted for its ratiacation even though this provision of the treaty removed by the reservation. that the british will ratify the treaty too. i hope that we will be able to deal with the tax situation by agreement. and that this reservation will be considered one of those incidents of our constitutional system which must be accepted. just like we accept such incidents in the british constitutional system. it is my deepest hope that the overall friendship and longstanding relationship between ourselves and the united kingdom will dictate that this treaty should be accepted on both sides. withstanding my disappointment and that of the british government with this result in the senate
i thank my colleague. he adds a very strong dimension to what i have said. we will try in our own federal tax law and in that of states like california to deal with this problem in a way which will at least try to cover some of the concerns raised in the deliberation on this treaty. i thank my colleague
yes. but we are talking  about the passage of this bill. the senator asked for an amendment. i asked the senator whether an amendment saying that the subscription shall be  earlier than october 1. 1979. would mean exactly what the budget committee said in bringing in its reportto wit. that we can pass the bill.-there is point of order against itprovided that it is  subscribable until october 1. 1979. and it comes within the budget and whatever ensues at that time can be argued about. but it would obviate the point of order against the bill and we could go ahead and do our business.
obviously. the senator does  prefer to deal with my question. my question was exactly that: if we conform to the budget act by making this subscription october 1. 1978. then. in my opinion. we simply reserve the question as to appropriation until an effort is made to subscribe. at that time. we can deal with it by appropriation or otherwise. obviously. the senator does  agree with me. so i shall bide my time.
the difference is we can buy oil out of the stabilization fund. the stabilization fund totally has already been established. is already in the process of use. and is  a budget fund. so if we can buy oil out of the stabilization fund-
 yet. if we can buy with the stabilization fund. that would be the difference. but we can. the only thing we can do with the stabilization fund is engage in operations like the witteveen facility. or swaps. and so on. so that is a big. fundamental difference. it is  just taking money out of the treasury to buy fungible goods. if we took money out of the treasury for the purpose of buying foreign currency. of course. we would have to budget it appropriately. but that is  what senator stevenson is arguing. he is arguing that we are taking money out of the fund. which is established. operating outside the budget process for this very purpose.
i have one question. as i understand the scheme of the amendment to the amendment. it would provide that next year. that is. when there is a new congress. we would have to come both within the budget and the appropriation process. but that this would constitute the necessary authorization. am i correct.
also. it is to be ed that the poverty line. as defined in the act in sections 525 and 625. relates to the percentage changes in the consumer price index rather than the changes in the lower living standard cost. the budget. so for these reasons. . because of our interest in the basic objective of this legislation. i join with senator nelson in opposing the amendment.
i listened very carefully to what my colleague said. but we are faced with something that gives me grave problems as a man of experience. a committee deals with a given question and shows some initiative. of all the things lacking in this country. one is a little initiative. some new ideas. some better way of doing things. here we are dealing with a stimulation of a private enterprise system. with the effort to help urban areas which are seriously depressed to recover. with the effort to avoid a system of quotas and a tough tariff and protectionism in this country. which will plunge us. i can predict that. into a serious recession or depression. it considers those carefully in committee. and because they are faced with a 2percent cut. and everybody wants to cut. and we have to have some brains about it. they cut what. in my judgment. seems to be in defiance of elementary wisdom and judgment in our own interest of how to really get this country going again and how to really have more income and how to really meet our budget goal. that is why i asked the question to be divided. let us use our judgment and discretion. if it was so important a week ago. why is it suddenly blown out of the window because somebody put up to 2percent cut across the board. i am  arguing with senator roth. he is one of our finest members. and his good faith is undoubted. but i do  believe in meatax cuts. this is the right way to cut. but it also calls for the use of intelligence on our part. i think what we are doing respecting eda is completely counterproductive. and i hope very much that the senate turns it down.
i thank both of my colleagues. . our ecoic system still works. we. as a nation. are still as young and vital as we were. we however must do something quickly about our productivity and ecoic wellbeing. if we do . we will find ourselves in a more dangerous and a less ecoically capable world.
i have listened to the senator with great interest. i also have read with great interest the views of the senator and senator bellmon and the appropriations committee. they are entitled to the greatest respect. we have had our staffs working with the staffs of budget and appropriations in an effort to resolve these problems. the reason i asked the senator to let me say a word is that i would  wish for a moment to have it appear that senator pell. senator stafford. senator williams and i. in some cavalier way. disregarded it. of course. we did . we took it seriously. this critical element of this measure. i pledge myself to senator muskie. before we are through with the bill. to work it out satisfactorily. because we have the utmost regard for our colleagues and there is desire whatever to steal a march on appropriations or on budget. but we do realize the complexity of the problems which the senator ks as well as i do: impact aid is of critical importance to many members of the house and the senate. the administrations have generally been against it.  only this one. but previous administrations. they do  like the idea. we all. including me. think it essential to our communities. so we have to staour ground. i can expect the administration will cheer it. but i am certainly  going to get into any hostilities with the appropriations or budget committees. we perfectly understand. the appropriations committee will decide to appropriate or  to appropriate. we perfectly understand the appropriations must be within the budget parameters. all we say is that. if appropriated. it is our belief that these preferences are desirable.  unlike the hold harmless provision we have in many bills. in other words. if the money is available. then the law would say it goes in the following priorities. we have. of course. the perfect power to change those priorities. so i am glad for what the senator said. but i did  wish to leave any impression we have just overlooked or disregarded his concern. on the contrary. we have taken it with deep seriousness. it is our purpose to try to achieve a practical solution with the senators committee. and with senator youngs and senator magnusons committee. in order to deal with the problems which the senator very properly raised.
to come back to this gifted and talented matter. . that i have every confidence that the appropriations committee fully recognizes the emous leverage which exists in this program. i think it is very sad that the office of education was able to make only 14 grants in fiscal 1978 out of 16.000 local agencies of education. senator chiles and senator magnuson are going to help us do better. and i certainly would  stand in the way of what they feel that they on the appropriations committee should do to facilitate the action.
