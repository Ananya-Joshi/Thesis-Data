i said this typified the argument. and it does. what the senator from georgia has said only bears that out. first. i dismiss the remark about the "moneybags" in new york because. while that may have sounded true in the 19th century and perhaps the early 20th century. it is longer true.  will the federal reserve bank in atlanta endorse it. there are many financial centers in this country. and they do  hold second candles to one aher. we may have more dollars in new york. but we have more real power in terms of the community in which we live than do the "moneybags" in georgia. but aside from thatbecause i think it is quite extraneous to the fundamental point. which is the constitutionwe. too. are for one standard. we are for the constitution. we are  for police dogs and cattle prods to oppress negroes who want to sing in a town square in order to make their protest.
