. i am delighted to learn that the subcommittee on privileges and elections chaired by senator can of nevada has reported to the full rules committee a slightly modified version of s. 343. a bill to require public disclosure of income and financial activities of top officials in all three branches of government. it was in 1958 that i first introduced this bill. each congress since then i have reintroduced it with a growing number of cosponsors including the majority and miity leaders of the senate. in the last session a hearing on this bill was held by the subcommittee at which i was glad to testify along with senator spo who has taken a lively interest in the whole matter. it is my hope that the full committee will act to report the bill to the senate before our recess begins. at a time when the executive branch is vigorously seeking to root out corruption in public office. i can think of more salutory action than passage of our bill. it would do more. as the short title states. "to promote public confidence in the legislative. executive. and judicial branches of the government of the united states" than any other single action we could take. specifically. the bill would apply to all persons earning $15.000 or more in the legislative. executive. and judicial branches of government. each employee would have to report. on behalf of him and his spouse. the amount and source of each item of incomeincluding gifts exceeding $100 in valuethe value of each asset and the amount of each liability in excess of $1.000. any transactions in securities and commodities if the amount exceeds $1.000 and any real estate transactions other than the purchase or sale of his personal residence which exceed $1.000. reports would be filed annually with the general accounting office and. most important of all. be open to public inspection.
