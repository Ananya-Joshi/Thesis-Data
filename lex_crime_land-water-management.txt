. that congress take the lead in this matter and reassert with precision and clarity the original intent of congress regarding the four statutes at issue in this legislation. we must renew and reinvigorate our pledge to those whom these statutes sought to protect so that they will be free to pursue their dream of selfrealization. without discrimination due to race. sex age. or handicap. equally important is our responsibility to all americans to reaffirm that congress absolutely will  tolerate taxsupported discrimination. it is shameful that this body. in this. the 100th congress. has even to debate a principle that stands as.the cornerstone of our constitution. but it is clear in the aftermath of the grove city decision that our worst fears have been realized: federal enforcement of the bedrock civil rights statutes has been weakened. from compliance reviews of institutions receiving federal financial assistance. to investigation of discrimination complaints. federal agencies are taking a new and narrow view of their responsibilities in light of this supreme court decision. today. we are renewing and redoubling our efforts to restore our nations civil rights commitment to its original scope and strength. the federal government can longer afford to tolerate discrimination in any program or activity that is assisted by the american tax dollars. it is imperative that congress take the lead on this vital issue and move forward to redress this void of inequality left by the grove city decision. and to guarantee equal rights and opportunity for all americans. Â• i urge  only my colleagues strong support of the civil rights restoration act of 1987. but their assistance in ensuring its expeditious consideration. with its passage. the march toward a society of freedom and equal opportunity for all. which has been halted the last 3 years. will once again continue.*
it could be. yes. then they went on to explain in their view months could pass and still lead to prompt reporting. in other words. this is a very large loophole. and this debate in the senate could support a complete reversal of the attitude of the house when we desired a prompt reporting of when the rape occurred. read what the senate said.
question about it. the facts are that of the total imports from the european soviet bloc by the united kingdom. for example. an aggregate of about 90 percent is in food and raw materials. the russians and satellites are  selling manufactured goods. they are showing them around to make an impression that they have them to sell. but when it comes down to cases they do  have them to sell. but more than that. with all the fanfare the british were going to make with the russians to sell them goods. britishrussian trade has fallen.  increased. it is a communist fraud. but it is a fraud which is serious to the free world unless we meet it  only in terms of denunciation but in terms of actually recognizing that we have to have new markets if you want to replace these old markets. and that europe has to have a supply of raw materials from what you call softcurrency countries if you are going to replace entirely their traditional suppliers behind the iron curtain. a perfectly remarkable job has been done already in cutting down the business between the free world and the communist world.
if i may have the attention of the chairman of the committee on foreign relations. i should like to ask whether there is any provision in the treaty presently under consideration. with the sultan of muscat and oman. which could lead us into the same kind of culdesac we face as to the saudi arabian treaty. that is the first part of my question. the second part is whether the senator feels we might get into such a situation. based upon his own inquiry and investigation with respect to the treaty before us.
my name has been mentioned here a few times and i had better get my position straight rather than be linked with a position which i do  espouse. . i was only suggesting. more as a lawyer. really. than a legislator. that having gotten a report about a very serious act which may very well lead us into some kind of conflict. and quite properly. we ought to have all the facts. which is precisely what the senator from new hampshire said. and what we must all say. so that whichever side of this question one may espouse. however it may be characterized tonight. one thing is clear. that as men with a tremendous and awful responsibility. which we have . all of us k that this bill is  just a bill to deal with the crime of hijacking. which we did  happen to cover by law before it leaves here. it is going to say a lot more than that. and it thould. it should respond to the existing situation. but let us at least k what the situation is. let us k its implications. at least overnight. in terms of the facts. and in terms of its effect upon all the americas. then we can really do what we ought to do. and i agree with the senator from new hampshire and the senator from oregon. face the issue with a clear and factual eye. so that my suggestion. in terms of my approval of what the majority leader has done. is good for 24 hours only. but i think we need to do the right. the vigorous. the forceful. the effective thing for our country. i am grateful for the opportunity afforded me.
of course the senator from new york does . especially in view of the demonstrated ugly facts to which i have referred on a number of occasions and in the course of these remarks with respect to the flagrant denial of the basic american right to vote to thousands upon thousands of americans. i shall  burden the record further because it has already been demonstrated time and time again with the percentages of those who vote in the socalled black counties. showing the miniscule percentage of those who are negroes. where it is unpopular. very unhealthy. and very unsafe for any negro to try to vote. and where the greatest abuses with respect to these literacy tests exist.  as to the means which may be used to end these abuses. i shall close upon this e. with respect to the authority of congress to prescribe the means. i should like to refer to the famous case of mcculloch against maryland. which is one of the earliest and most fundamental supreme court cases in this field. having been decided in 1819. in that case the court said: let the end be legitimate. let it be within the scope of the constitution. and all means which are appropriate. which are plainly adapted to that end. which are  prohibited. but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution. are constitutional. then there is a whole series of cases: united states against darby. guss against utah labor relations board. first iowa hydroelectric coop. against federal power commission. everards breweries against day. westfall against united states. ruppert against caffey. burroughs against united states. there is a whole series of cases in which congress is given the greatest latitude to choose the means. once there has been established the constitutional basis. i close upon this e. i have endeavored in these remarks to make two points. one. and very important. is the point that this matter is  ended. that the country will have a right to hold us all to account. indeed. that it is the duty of the citizenry to hold us to account. that is how critically important this subject is. it involves questions of public order where public order has been breached. in riots and in other serious disorders. it involves very deeply the morale of the country. who for a moment in his right mind can say that the sitins. the waitins. the prayins. the freedom riders are  a manifestation of a deep current an undercurrent. a deep current of protest against an intolerable state of affairs under present conditions. of course it affects vitally and materially. as has been observed in the senate time and again. our whole international basis. with twothirds of the world being inhabited by yellow. black. and brown people. whom we are endeavoring to lead in the interest of freedom. that is point one. point two is the fact that this is an ugly state of facts which we are trying to remedy. yet opportunity is being given to remedy it. constitutionality is based on that ugly state of facts. that is what gives us the right to try to remedy the situation. i believe the bill before the senate is an entirely reasonable means and is entirely constitutional. that is the one issue that has  been met in this debate by anyone except the proponents of the measure. we should continue this debate. we should deal with this legislation. we should deal with the amendments that will be proposed. and have been proposed. we should deal with the civil rights problem in our country under the cover of this legislation. it is our duty to lead the country and to arouse it in this respect. because the issue certainly deserves it. then. after that has been done effectively and adequately. in aher week or two or threeyes. if need be. in order to suit the senate tradition. and apparently that must be done. even though it may be mumbo jumbo. and even after roundtheclock sessions. and after doing all that in order to impress the country that we mean businessthen let us take aher cloture vote and see what the answer is in terms of individual responsibility of individual senators outside the south. of whom there are plenty to do the job with respect to this legislation. then we will have a right to speak of what has been done. and  before.
. martin luther king was a very great man. he would have been the first. if he could speak to us today. to counsel this kind of a living memorial. the historic words "we shall overcome" are words of light. words of continuity. and words of optimism. that is the spirit of martin luther king. there is much work for us to do. the civil rights bill  in the other body is one unfinished task. we will shortly be debating the supplemental appropriations bill. either today. or monday or tuesday next. which contains aher kind of cause to which martin luther king was deeply dedicated. there are other memorials which will keep his memory alive. there are schools. there are bridges. there are airports. and there are many other things in our nation which should be used to remind our children that there was a dr. martin luther king and how he served and how he loved his country. what all of us should have in our minds and hearts in that he was for justice for men of all races.  just negroes. for this he gave his life. his life of violence will overcome. provided we take the appropriate lessons from his life and tragic death. as i have tried to outline. under the grief of the moment. as some of those to which we have to repair today. so let us  just speak words of memorial and pass the issue. but let us be deeply impressed by dr. martin luther kings death as by his life. with the determination that we have it within our power to bring about a realization of the things for which he gave his life. our greatest tribute to his memory will be to make them come true.
