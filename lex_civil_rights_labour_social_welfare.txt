. in order to protect employees against the danger to their pension rights of such retrenchment moves in the case of an emergency loan guarantee. i had contemplated proposing an amendment to make it a condition of a loan guarantee that the company receiving it must. during the period the guarantee is in effect. purchase for any employee who has worked in the enterprise 5 years or more. and who is permanently laid off. an annuity equivalent to the amount of contributions made to the plan by the employer on behalf of that particular employee. or by the employee himself if he made any contribution. or both. a number of other senators whose names i shall list in the record propose to join me in that amendment.
. as the author of the bill of rights for the mentally retarded . legislation which would for the first time establish strict standards to protect the human rights of the mentally retarded and stimulate alternative programs of community care. i commend to the attention of senators an article entitled "congress awakens to  of the subcommittee on handicapped of the labor and public welfare committee. and a cosponsor of the bill. urging him to initiate hearings on the bill. i recognize the difficulty of scheduling hearings at this late date but i believe we have a responsibility to begin hearings on the issue so that we can continue to focus the publics attention on the plight of the mentally retarded. and in this way. we will be able to expedite the consideration of this problem in the next congress. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
