if this provision were to become law. we could anticipate great pressure on the federal government to use every export subsidy tool at its disposal to get rid of huge stocks of surplus tobacco. in addition to the export enhancement program [eep] and the targeted export assistance [tea] program. there is title i of public law 480. the food for peace program. under this program. developing countries can buy u.s. commodities at highly favorable terms. . i think we recognize that here in the united states we are doing everything we can to reduceand this is  solely the public. this is the federal government as wellas a result of the surgeon generals uncontradicted reportswe are doing everything we can to reduce the consumption of to.bacco. and so the question arises: what are we doing subsidizing exports into countries which can least afford the costly health effects of tobacco.  i certainly hope that we are  going to get back into this business of subsidizing tobacco. that the taxpayers do that. so i ask my colleagues for their support.
let me assure my good friend from oregon that explanation at all is necessary insofar as he is concerned as he is the man who has been on his feet for almost 2 days  under the most difficult of circumstances trying to get this legislation through. second. clearly second to him. i have been here with him to try to accomplish the same end. and indeed all i wanted to do was to give the opportunity for me to exercise my jurisdiction. i. in my opening comments. gave indication what this matter was about or who was involved or how it came to pass. except for the fact i was  here when it was decided. al. i am trying to do is have the opportunity to sit down with the interested parties to try to work this thing out. as i indicated in my remarks. i think the senator from oregon has started to recapture the distinction that used to go with the appropriations committee in his leadership of it both in committee and on the floor. and there is just question in my mind that both my most enjoyable moments and my most productive moments are in his company on the business of the appropriations committee. he feels very strongly. i happen to k. about the fact that he is the chairman of that committee and that he is  going to give up any of the jurisdiction either to the executive branch or other committees in the legislative branch. so it is when i took on the chairmanship of the subcommittee on labor. health and human services that i am trying to emulate his style of leadership. i will  give up the jurisdiction of that subcommittee to anyone else. but rather try to work things out with all my colleagues. and trying to achieve the aspirations of all of my colleagues. republican and democratic alike. as they relate to the committee. so i do  see any problem at all. i think it can be worked out. i would like to leave the amendment where it is. which in effect gives us that opportunity to work on it. it has been laid aside and i think we all understand what the import of it is and it seems to me this matter can be resolved very quickly once everyone gets together. but i could  agree more with the &nator from oregon because certainly there was ody who wanted to do anything intentionally during my absence from the floor and i take the responsibility for it. again i repeat i think this whole matter will be resolved.
