. during the summer of 1985. a very special 16yearold young man from east providence. ri. came to washington. at my request. and served as a senatorial page. the page program is very challenging to the young people who are selected for it. usually. it is their first time away from home. often the schedule is grueling. the pages quickly learn to recognize the faces of 100 senators. previously unkn to them. and to make their way with ease through the maze of hallways and tunnels that connect the office buildings and the capitol. it is easy job. all of the young people who serve as senatorial pages are special. but joe cons stood out from the rest. he broke new ground in the senate and stood as an example of what could be accomplished by those who are physically and mentally challenged. joe was the first individual with a serious disability to serve in the page program. and he served with distinction. while joe was in washington. he became something of a celebrity. giving newspaper interviews and even appearing on the nbc morning news program "the today show." but this was  the first time he was recognized for his achievements. joe was also the recipient of the special olympics gold medal in the area of the butterfly stroke. i continue to be impressed by joe. on june 10 he will join the eagle court of ho. this is an ho bestowed on the boy scout who has earned 21 merit badges and is the highest tribute offered by the scouts. it is surprise to me that joe has earned this special recognition. the boy scouts stands as a symbol of patriotism. courage. and selfreliance. joseph p. cons epitomizes those ideals. i join joes friends and family in applauding his tremendous accomplishments. i ask that a news article pertaining to this matter appear in the record.
