. if i can have the attention of the senate. i think that in the course of our deep feeling about this matter we are straying far from the point. because we are  dealing with the matter of a penalty for a wrong. we are dealing with a sanction. the penalty for a wrong should be jail. if one is guilty of trespassing. rioting. or doing violence. the penalty which we are imposing is a sanction. it does  have a relation to the wrong. it has a relation to denying a privilege which we otherwise would enjoy. second. e of us is arguing about the merits. we are arguing about the means. namely. shall it be done by the federal government making it mandatory. or shall it be placed in the hands of the individual institution. when we talk about precedents. i ask senators to remind themselves about the farmers who stopped milk trucks and spilled the milk all over the road. has anyone in this chamber suggested that they should be deprived of the benefits of commodity stabilization. what about people who enjoy benefits from the federal government in many other ways. what about businessmen who get export licenses. has anyone suggested that they should be denied them under the antitrust laws should they have violated them. has anyone suggested they are guilty of a misdemea who would deprive a citizen of his right to vote unless state laws deprive him of it. we k that the whole doctrine of american jurisprudence is against sanctions. our constitution is against sanctions. that is why i feel as strongly as i do. that is why i believe that students will feel as strongly as they will about this matter. because it is  based on the tradition of american jurisprudence. it is the congress acting out of resentment. it feels that this will stop the riots or future violence.
