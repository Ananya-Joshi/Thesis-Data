. i rise today to recognize brown universitys 1976 ivy league championship football team. which recently was inducted into the brown university athletic hall of fame. in particular. i want to salute joe wirth. an assistant coach of that team. who was inducted into the brown hall of fame in his own right in 1995. and who was an important influence on my own collegiate athletic career. joe coached at brown from 1973 to 1979. and during his tenure. the brown university bears compiled an impressive 42181 record. joe wirth was a defensive genius. and it certainly showed out on the fieldthe brown defense was nationally ranked in five of those seven seatons. in the 1976 championship year. when the bears led the way with an .81 record. they allowed the secondfewest points in the ivy league. and that stingy defense translated into victories over the traditional league powers: princeton. harvard. and yale. it was the first time in the schools history that they beat all three in the same season. as if his responsibilities to the football team were  egh. joe also was the coach of the wrestling team during that time and he helped keep the program alive. he produced a new england champion in 1976. as one of joes cocaptains on the 197576 wrestling team. i can attest that he had the respect and admiration of all of his wrestlers. we were. all so grateful for his leadership and for his encouragement. despite the time commitments associated with his football and wrestling teams. joe remained a family man. with his wife. carol. he raised a wonderful family of six children. to this day. joe wirth is a popular figure in brown athletic circles. his players still recall his admonition to never give up "until the last white line is crossed." in ho of his accomplishments as a brown coach. i will conclude with a toast first offered to the 1976 ivy league champions by my classics professor. john rowe workman: to your continued good health to your continued prosperity and to the maintenance of the great traditions
. i want to take this opportunity to recognize the retirement of an extraordinary rhode islander. dr. walter thayer. walter thayer was born in east providence in 1929back when there were farms in what is  an urban area. he graduated from providence college and left for tufts university medical school in 1950. he returned to rhode island in 1965 to become the first director of the gastroentorology division of brown medical school and rhode island hospital after having worked at the national institutes of health. georgetown. and yale university school of medicine. dr. thayers professional qualifications are outstanding. he served for 30 years as the chief of gastroenterology at brown university and affiliated hospitals. and has been a professor at brown since 1972. he was the head of gastroenterology at rhode island hospital from 1965 to 1994 and continued as a practicing physician until this year. he has been presented with the distinguished clinician award by the american gastroenterology association. the humanitarian of the year award by both the rhode island and new england chapters of the crohns colitis foundation of america. and the w.w. keene award for contribution to brown medical school. walter has presented at the quadrennial lecture on crohns disease at the third world congress in copenhagen. and served as the chairman of the nihnfic sponsored symposium on infectious agents in inflammatory bowel diseases and as the gover for rhode island to the american college of gastroenterology. one of the great ironies is that walter. who became such a fixture at brown medical school and trained and mentored so many fine physicians there. so desired to attend brown university ahd was  admitted. indeed. his experience in the world outside of brown and the- ivy league was one of the factors that made him such a valuable bridge between town and gown between patient care and academic research. this bridging between -patient care and academic research is a key facet of dr. thayers career. his true caring and empathy for his patients informed his extensive research. that research. where walte sought to understand the causes of crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. and find effective treatments to these and other debilitating gastrointenstinal illnesses. has been remarkable and extensive. and has garnered walter national and international ren. to ho dr. thayers service to the health and academic communities in rhode island. many of those whom walter has affected. including mentors. colleagues. students and patients. gathered on october 7 to wish him well in his life in retirement. and to thank him for his service. dedication. caring. and friendship. at that time. one colleague said that walter had earned the highest respect a doctor could earnhis colleagues would refer their family members to him. he was described as the father of gastroenterology in. rhode island. someone who is a masterful teacher and had great love for his patients. dr. jose behar said that walters patients trusted him so completely that when dr. behar would treat one of them. perhaps when walter was on vacation. they would invariably ask him "do you think dr. thayer would agree with you." dr. behar said that as an accomplished doctor having his treatments questioned so bluntly was a little offputting. but he came to realize that it did  stem from a lack of confidence in him as much as the patients remarkable level of trust. respect and belief in walter. to only speak of his professional life. however. is to miss a great deal about walter. he is someone who is constantly curious. as is demonstrated by the fact that even . well beyond the age of 70. he finds himself back in school pursuing an associates degree in wildflower ecology. he has a great love of books. and is often found in his favorite chair. his glasses perched on his e. a great book open in his hands. he is extremely activehe has run triathlons. marathons. and he spends many winter hours crosscountry skiing. and he is a loving husbafid. father. and friend. he sincerely cares about issues far from the realm of medicine. important social issues. and tries to address them in a real and admirable fashion. for example. as his children were growing up. he did  want them to only have kledge of the city. so one summer he took his kids to an amish farm and they all worked on that farm. he did  want his children to grow up isolat6d from questions of race. and made many efforts to bring them into close contact with families and children of different races and ethnicities. . even though dr. thayer is officially retired. he continues his long volunteer service at the veterans affairs hospital and in his teaching at brown university. he is looking forward to the opening of the new infectious bowel disease research laboratory that will open at rhode island hospitalwhich will be named "the walter r. thayer inflammatory bowel disease laboratory." what a fitting ho that this new. stateoftheart research laboratory will be named for him. walter leaves behind a remarkable legacy. i k my colleagues join me in saluting him on his welldeserved retirement.0

. the problem of se pollution continues to attract the attention of scholars. concerned citizens. and the general public. ever since the introduction of my billh.r. 14602 on april 21. 1966. in the 89th congress. in this session h.r. 2819to establish an office of se control in the office of the surgeon general of the united states. at which time i called for action to attack this problem before it got out of hand. i have found more and more interest and study of the problem. and i have been pleased to bring various items on the subject to the attention of my colleagues. frederick w. parkhurst. jr.. associate professor of ecoics at guilford college at greensboro. n.c.. has done a fine study on se. jets. and the sonic boom. and his letter and thesis follow:
. i would like to join in expressing my enthusiastic support for the senior citizen intern program. and my appreciation to senator roth for making this program possible. this is the first year that my office has participated in the program. which brings senior citizens to washington for 2 weeks to participate in the daytoday activities of congressional offices and to study programs and issues of concern to senior citizens. i had the privilege of sponsoring mr. arthur prevost. of tiverton. r.i.. as my intern. as a former businessman and state legislator. mr. prevost brought to my office a wealth of experience which was extremely valuable to me and my staff.  an effective and impressive advocate for the elderly. his work here during this intense 2week period contributed immensely to my understanding and awareness of the problems and concerns of our elderly citizens. the intern program gave him an opportunity to participate directly in the legislative process. and to gain a greater understanding of the broad national issues which affect the daily lives of senior citizens. he had a firsthand look at how the government operates and how our laws are developed. an experience which he can share with other senior citizens in my state to help them participate more fully in their government. it also gave me the opportunity to learn more about the direct effect of government programs on the elderlytheir successes and failures. and the need for improvements. the ideas and suggestions he shared with me will be invaluable in my work on important issues such as social security. medicare. transportation. housign. nutrition programs. and many others. this program provides the kind of direct citizen involvement which has made our democracy strong. and keeps the lines of communication open between government and its people. i am grateful for the hard work of senator rot and his staff in making this opportunity possible. and i look forward enthusiastically to participating in this program in the future.*
. i am pleased to join with senator stafford as a cosponsor of this bill to reauthorize the head start programa program which has. in its 21 years. compiled an impressive track record. head start provides educational. medical. and nutritional services to more than 450.000 lower income preschoolers. with the aim of closing the gap between disadvantaged children and their more fortunate peers. this bill reauthorizes the program through fiscal year 1990. increasing the authorized funding level by 4 percent each year. this will mean. for example. that in the next fiscal yearfiscal year 1987. the authorization for head start will rise to $1.13 billionan increase of $44 million over this yearsfiscal year 1986appropriation. these modest increases will allow head start to continue its current responsibilities. helping to alleviate need for cutbacks in services. with this 4year reauthorization in place. the program will be assured of a future that is as successful as its past. head start is a program that works. its effectiveness has been documented time and again. in study after stpdy. findings like these are typical: head starters score higher than head starters on standardized tests of intelligence. school readiness. math. language. vocabulary. and perceptual skills. they perform better in school. and less frequently require special education. in later years. they are more likely to hold afterschool jobs. and less likely to show signs of delinquency. head starts results are evident in medical as well as scholastic records. children receiving head starts health services improve in physical development and motor skills relative to other children. and they are more likely to be of mal height and weight. to .have fewer absences from schobl. and to perform better on physical tests. thus. the good that head start does resounds through the years. as studies have shown. but it also resounds through entire communities. thanks to the programs consistent emphasis on parent and community involvement: for every five head start children. four parents volunteer their services to the program. clearly. the program reinforces parents commitment to their childrens wellbeing. with results that last a lifetime. all these factors account for the most convincing evaluation of allhead starts benefits. as compared to its costs. when one considers the special and remedial education that are  needed because of head start. the programs benefits outrun its costs by more than 2to1. head start enriches the lives of thousands of rhode island children and their families. with eight programs currently in operation. these programs serve more than 1.500 rhode island children in cranston. newport. th providence. th scituate. south county. providence. riversinde. warren. bristol. warwick. and woonsocket. a letter i recently received from a young working couple in newportthe parents of five childrenexpresses far better than i ever could the special quality of the head start program: one very important part of our familys life is project head start. i say "family" because it is more than just a nursery/preschool. this program accommodates all of its participants family members. through its workshops. health screenings and high school equivalency programs. it reaches many peoples lives. personally. i consider the staff like friends. they offer counseling and assistance in many ways. i received assistance in getting our daughters hearing screened at the rhode island school for the deaf. the center even provided transportation. this christmas. we received a. food basket and toys for the children. we are a family trying to make it. but we do need help from time to time.  in its 21st year. head start has fulfilled the high hopes vested in it at the outset. i say without hesitation that it has proven itself well worth all we have invested since then. i urge my colleagues to support further head start successes by supporting this measure. and i look forward to its speedy enactment.. by mr. quayle:
. my bill would allow medicaid expenditures to support people in a wide variety of settings: from natural family homes to new community residences of up to about 12 people. in addition. s. 873 would allow 15 percent of a states total medicaid budget to be used to support institutional placements. one of my top priorities as a member of the u.s. senate has been to move us closer to the goal of a society in which those with disabilities can participate significantly in the work force. in schools. in recreational activities and in the community. we are in an era of changing techogy and experience. our understanding of the capabilities of those with disabilities is changing quickly. we have made tremendous strides in our ability to help those with disabilities to learn and to participate in many different facets of life. today i would like to share an example of the tremendous strides that can be made when those with disabilities and those with techogical expertise team up. as many of my colleagues in the senate k. my home state of rhode island is the sailing capital of the world. it stands to reason. therefore. that there are many individuals with disabilities in rhode island who would like to sail. unfortunately. the design of a sailing vessel is almost always a barrier to handicapped individuals. recently. an organization in rhode island called shakealeg. whose members have experienced spinal cord injuries or traumatic brain injuries. and the council of disabled sailors teamed up with naval architect gary mull and boat builder tillotsonpearson to develop a boat designed from the keel up for handicapped individuals. the result of their efforts is the freedomindependence. the freedomindependence is a small sailing vessel specifically designed so that those who are handicapped can sail it without assistance. it is a barrierfree boatthe first of its kind in the world. the design of this small boat represents a tremendous step forward for those who. simply because of their disability. have been denied access to a wonderful recreational activity that most other rhode islanders have the opportunity to enjoy. tillotsonpearson has donated the first two freedomindependence boats to shakealeg. the boats are berthed at the fort adams state park in newport. ri. and free sailing lessons are being offered to help individuals learn to sail. sailing director tommy banks has reported that the response has been tremendous. soon these very special boats will be available throughout the world. tillotsonpearson will sell future boats manufactured according to the freedomindependence design to organizations for the disabled at more than the cost of construction. freedomindependence is the perfect name for this spectacular result of the partnership between those with disabilities who have a dream for the future and those with the skills to make that dream a reality. there are many other disabled individuals who have a dream for the futurea dream of independence and opportunity. we in congress have the ability to make their dream a reality by enacting my legislation. s. 873. the production of the freedomindependence is one more step forward on the path to ensuring that those with disablities have the opportunity to participate in many facets of life that are taken for granted by those of us without disabilities. my legislation. s. 873. is aher step forward. i hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to make freedom and independence a reality for all disabled individuals.  just for those who sail.

. i am proud to join in sponsoring tile 1988 omnibus antidrug bill. this legislation. developed by a bipartisan task force. tackles our nations drug epidemic with force and intelligence. marijuana. cocaine. pcp. heroin. and a host of other illegal substances have permeated every core of american society. our nations drug problem affects every citizen. either directly or indirectly. it threatens to cripple our ecoic system and culture. despite the valiant efforts of many law enforcement officials. medical professionals. and social service agencies. the drug epidemic is still growing in america. in order to stop this epidemic we must reduce both the supply of and demand for drugs. we k that in spite of our work in the past few years. the supply of drugs in this country has continued to increase. it is clear that much more must be done. there is a web of drug supply lines that form americas drug ecoy. drugs are cultivated abroad and brought into the country by drug warlords and their organizations. these organizations manufacture and distribute the drugs that eventually filter down to smalltime suppliers and street pushers who sell to the american people. including children. we must intensify our efforts to put them out of business. state. local. and federal law enforcement officials fight to cut off the supply line of drugs from various points. the coast guard and customs service monitor our borders. their interdiction efforts. on the high seas and in the air. help seize illegal substances worth millions of dollars on the american street market. the drug enforcement agency works to arrest highlevel drug traffickers and immobilize their organizations. this legislation increases funding and personnel for drug interdiction efforts at the state. local. and federal levels. more will be available for the internal revenue service. drug enforcement agency. coast guard. national guard. defense department. federal bureau of investigation. and other state and federal agencies working to stop the inflow of drugs to our country. while it is important to reduce the supply of illegal drugs. it is even more important to concentrate on reducing the demand. our bill recognizes this and devotes 60 percent of the overall funding available toward demand reduction. in addressing demand reduction we look at both ends of tile spectrum: the casual user and the addict. it is estimated that 97 percent of drug users have families and jobs. they are our friends and colleagues. many of them are casual users who see little harm in their drug consumption. it doesnt occur to them that their use substantially contributes to october 14. 1.988 the crime. death. and destruction that is an integral part of the drug ecoy. it doesnt occur to them that casual drug use can and often does lead to serious drug addiction. they dont realize that their families suffer from their use of drugs. that they are less productive in their jobs. and that they are on a path which frequently leads to death. this drug bill introduces the concept of "user accountability" and significantly increases criminal sanctions for violation of federal narcotics control laws. with the passage of this legislation. we will be sending a message to casual users and those considering whether to experiment with drugs: this activity will come at a much higher price than ever before. drug dependency stems from casual use. most people dont become addicts overnight. but once they do. they become a drain on their families. communities. and society as a whole. they are unlikely to successfully maintain a job. they may steal from their families and friends to get the money to buy drugs. they may do all these things and many more without even realizing they have a problem. the only help for them is treatment. unfortunately. it is difficult to get treatment if you dont have the money to pay for it. waiting lists for rehabilitation can run as long as 9 months. that time can mean the difference between life or death for an addict. individuals seeking treatment have often hit rock bottom. before they can get help. many of these people will kill themselves. either through a tragic accident or overdose. or suicide. the treatment centers are doing all they can. but their resources are extremely limited and they simply can handle the number of drug addicts seeking help. the drug bill addresses this problem in part by increasing funding for the alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health administration [adamhai block grant. several weeks ago i introduced a bill. s. 2772. addressing the special treat. ment needs of drugaddicted pregnant women. many treatment centers put pregnant women on the bottom of those lists. this helps contribute to the 375.000 babies born annually with drugrelated health problems. thousands of these babies wouldnt have these problems if their mothers had received treatment during their pregnancy. the premise and goals of my legislation are embodied in several of our omnibus drug bills provisions. i was able to ensure that the bill require federally funded treatment centers to give priority attention to pregnant women. beyond treatment. our efforts to prevent drug abuse are critical. particularly for adolescents. more and more of our children use illegal substances every day at a much younger age than we might ever have imagined. the percentage of students using drugs by the sixth grade is three times what it was in 1975. according to the department of education. one out of every six 13yearolds have used marljuana and one out of every six high school seniors have used cocaine. once a young person experiments for the first time. he or she often ends up spiraling deeper and deeper into a morass of problems as if caught in quicksand. in one study. students taking marijuana were twice as likely to average ds and fs than a using student. the department of education estimates that high school seniors who are heavy drug users are more than three times as likely to drop out of school than drug users. we have to get to our children before drugs take over their lives. we must provide them with alternatives to drug abuse that will motivate and excite them to excel in their endeavors. senator stafford and i introduced s. 2769 earlier this year. establishing a comprehensive community prevention initiative program which has been included in the omnibus drug bill. this demonstration project encourages the establishment of programs aimed at highrisk children. such as those who are likely to drop out of school or who have already dropped out. the programs will involve youth in communitybased after school or weekend activities such as sports. theater. or volunteer work. they may also offer training or employment opportunities. these programs will provide children with the opportunity to live a drugfree life from the start by giving them the selfesteem and sense of purpose they need to be successful. educating potential drug users and rehabilitating drug dependents will help more and more americans lead healthy and productive lives. reformed drug users are contributing to our society and enjoying a confidence in their sobriety and in themselves. approving this bill will put many more potential drug users or drug dependents back on the right track. this comprehensive package intelligently and forcefully attacks both the supply and demand for drugs bringing us one step closer to that goal. passage of our bill will send a strong message to both drug users and drug traffickers. the price of their activities is a price tile american people will longer shoulder. i urge my colleagues to join us in sending this message.
madam president. i am delighted to be here today to support senator harkins important amendment in .the fight against teenage smoking. the attorney general of my home state of rhode island has urged congress to provide the full funding level of $34 million requested by the food and drug administration. our attorney general believes adequate funding is critical to our success in reducing the level of smoking among children and adolescents. and i agree with him. furthermore with the evidence that we  have regarding the epidemic of teen smoking as outlined by the distinguished senator from iowa. and all the implications this has for the future. it seems to me there is excuse for delaying full implementation of this critical program. as has been pointed out. smoking among high school seniors is at a 17year high. that is very discouraging. smoking among 8th and 10th graders has increased by more than 50 percent in the last 6 years. state and local officials need this money for enforcement purposes. and the money is also needed to educate retailers about their responsibilities. in my home state. even though we have a law prohibiting retailers from selling tobacco products to mis. over 70 percent of high school smokers were  asked to show proof of their age when purchasing cigarettes. according to our attorney general. rhode island stores each year are sellingi was stunned by this figure. we are a small state. a million peoplel million dollars worth of cigarettes to underage consumers. and the main reason. of course. is the lack of resources at the local level to enforce the law. we have been able to provide the funds for education. we have to be able. in my judgment. to provide funds for education and enforcement of this rule to make it meaningful. . there is a little less than $5 million provided thus far by the senate. that is nice. but it just plain is  egh. with the improvement of the sunset provisions in the new offset. i believe there is good reason  to vote for this amendment. preventing underage smoking should be a national priority and providing full funding of this program is an important step toward achieving that goal. so i urge my colleagues to join me in this effort .to eradicate teenage smoking. i thank the chair and i thank the distinguished senator from iowa for his leadership.

. i rise to call my colleagues attention to the recent recognition very justly accorded a constituent of mine who has. through his profession. contributed substantially to improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities. russell l. stecker. asenior partner in the hartfordbased architecture firm of stecker. labau & arneill. has served as a member of connecticuts general assembly and was deeply involved in establishing the nations first uniform state building code requiring access for persons with disabilities. for his efforts he was presented the first jane sokolov award by the hartford easter seal rehabilitation center. a recognition which itself is named for aher pioneering professional who dedicated her lifes work to firmly establishing comprehensive outpatient medical and vocational rehabilitation services in the greater hartford area. russ stecker richly deserves to be the first sokolov award recipient. through both his public and professional lives he is removing the barriers that society places in the paths to independence and fulfillment for disabled people. and while this congress and its predecessors can be proud of our efforts to insist on full integraton of disabled people in our society. it etheless remains for caring. capable individual citizens to insist and assist in getting the job done. russ stecker. through his efforts on behalf of disabled people. has set an example for all of us to follow.e
. as chairman of the senate subcommittee on the handicapped. i would like to recognize one of the most successful and inative rehabilitation programs in the united states. casa colina in pamona. ca. which is  celebrating its 50th anniversary of service to disabled people. casa colina is today a multicorporate profit organization providing rehabilitation treatment and training to more than 5.000 infants. children. and adults each year. with a staff of some 800 persons. beginning as a 10bed home for poliostricken children. casa colina has become one of the nations leading comprehensive medical and vocational centers for rehabilitatioe of only a few in the country offering the broadest possible range of rehabilitation services. and is in the forefront of the research. development. and implementation of inative rehabilitation techogy to benefit functionally limited persons. casa colinas nationally recognized leadership has  come about by chance. dynamic and generous dissemination of the development and implementation of its many inative. newtothefield rehabilitation programs has been a way of life for the professional and administrative casa colina staff. to assist functionally limited people everywhere to be aided by methodologies developed at casa colina. every available forum has been utilized to pass the word along. the value of this effort. especially over the last 14 years. is evidenced in the proliferation of casa colina model programs in other institutions nationwide. programs especially well received and replicated include: comprehensive back pain program. one of the first of its kind. developed in 1973. traumatic brain injury rehabilitation program. developed and opened in 1975. years before most institutions were aware that medical science advancements were radically increasing the survival rate of those catastrophically injured. transitional living center programfor brain injured adults. 1980. the first in the west. a multilevel residential training program leading to community reentry and employment when possible. comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation services. earlier kn as the adult day treatment movement in california. established in 1978. comprehensive vocational services for disabled and disadvantaged adults going far beyond the usual program of vocational evaluation offered by many rehabilitation facilities. a wheelchair sports program for patients and disabled community youth and adults. established in 1978. second to e in the country in scope. achievement. breadth of program. and selfsustaining- ability. its world class. fourtime national champion wheel chair basketball team has won tournaments around the world. a joint neurotrauma rehabilitation program with pomona valley community hospitala regional trauma centerfor the earliest possible rehabilitation intervention in catastrophic injury cases. established in 1985. a network of rehabilitation affiliates. together with consultation. management. and joint venture opportunities. tncorporated in 1984. enables rehabilitation facilities anywhere to take advantage of casa colinas clinical. financial. and management kledge and expertise to advance their particular capabilities.*
. i concur with the arguments presented by the distinguished senator from florida. and i am sure there will be many more amendments offered upon which the senator from th carolina and i will disagree. i will be brief. what is at issue here is what is at issue in mathy of the areas of controversy between the senator from th carolina and the senator from connecticut. and that is the value of. and the necessity for kledge and education. the senator from th carolina. in this amendment. is objecting to title x. which is an education program meant to assure that the tragedy of unwanted pregnancy does  occur. or unwanted abortion does  occur. or infant mortality does  occur. or low birthweight babies does  occur. that is what is at issue here. just a matter of kledge to assure that people understand the consequences of their acts. that they understand the alternatives available to themeducation and kledge. this amendment. to eliminate title x comes from the same school. it comes from the same school of thought that says. "lets  educate on the subject of aids for fear that we are going to teach homosexuality." when. indeed. the only manner that we have to deal with this disease is education. is kledge. we have vaccine. we have chemotherapy. all we have is education. but you can educate. you can give that kledge for fear that you will teach homosexuality. so those who are at greatest risk never receive the kledge necessary to avert the tragedies of that disease. after the u.s. senate gets through with its huffing and puffing on what to do with the crisis of drugs confronting this nation. i simply suggest that hing we do will ever be able to dry up the supply coming into the united states. our job is to dry tip the demand by educating our chfldreo. 5 years of age oil. if necessary. & to what taking drugs mean to ther livesdeath or something close to it. but the only way we do that is by education. by kledge. the billions that are required  will be far less than the trillions that will be required eventually to go ahead and combat that problem. so whether you talk pregnancies. whether you talk aids. whether you talk drugs. yes. kledge is the basis of any assistance or any victory which we hope to attain. but apparently there is a school of thought of kledge. education. let the consequences speak for themselves. i do  think that is a course of action that any civilized nation would deem prudent. title x is  an abortion program. it is a kledge program. it has been emously successful. indeed. the department of health and human servlets. which monitors the program. has  found any violation of the prohibition within that program for abortions. so there has been violation there. the family planning programs under title x proceed to disseminate kledge. there will be more on the subject in the course of debate. do we want to go ahead and confront the problems of this nation through kledge. or are we to swim in a sea of igance and reap the consequences therefrom. for those who differ from this senator on the subject of choice and the subject of abortion. they should stand up en masse and be for title x because. indeed. if the precepts of that program are followed. then you do  even get into the subject of abortion. i really have more to say on this because i suspect this is going to be farreaching in terms of the debate. i do  want to use up the time of the senate. but i want to make one other comment insofar as this legislation is concerned. i am talking about all of the legislation. this bill has as its purpose the funding of those agencies and programs administered by the federal government which impact upon education. health. science. labor. and safety in the workplace. twentyeight residents of the state of connecticut are dead because of inadequate osha funding and osha inspections. it has to do with the education of our children. those who are ecoically disadvantaged and those who are handicapped. when we passed 94142 13 years ago. we said we are going to fund 40 percent of that program. we have never gone over 12 percent. . we have 8 percent in this bill. even  that is in danger. the funding for research and education. insofar as aids is concerned. is in this bill. but we are going to delay it because of philosophical disagreements on this floor. i point out to my colleagues that 2 years ago the senator from florida and the senator from connecticut instructed that an aids mailer go out to the american public. and because of the philosophical debates within the administration. that mailer is 1 year late1 year late. . you answer me the question: how many of our fellow citizens contracted the disease in that i year and who will  die because somebody wanted to have an academic or philosophical debate. make mistake about it. whether it is delay on the senate floor or delay in the actions of this government. there is a price to be paid. we are within 1 month from our young people attending the various institutions of learning in this country thanks to ecoic assistance from their governmentstudent loans. grants. it is all in this bill. heart disease. cancer. diabetes. arthritis. all those matters that make us weep daily as we lose loved ones. friends. the research that goes into finding cures. it is all in this bill. childhood immunization. it is in this bill. geriatric training so that we have adequate personnel to deal with this aging population. it is in this bill. funds to reduce the nurse shortage that the nation is  experiencing. nurse training. are in this bill. vocational education. it is in this bill. i go down the check list. i have said before and i will say it again. here the chairman of the committee is being put through this exercise of having to read over 200 committee amendments. what a travesty. what a waste of power. i understand having an up and down vote on the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina. if somebody objects. let them have an amendment and let us have it out and be done with it. but why hold hostage the diseased. the ill. the children. the elderly. the workers of this nation to the philosophies of a few on this senate floor or within the administration. a waste of power that is durs to exercise is only matched by the tragedy that that waste visits on others. unless there is objection. i would move to table the amendment. but i certainly will withhold for the senator from illis.
. i oppose the amendment of the distin. guished senator from th carolina. at the appropriate moment i will have to move to table it. i find it ironic that in the course of two amendments on the floor. my distinguished colleague from th carolina. who certainly is among the most foremost of the advocates for states rights. would in the instance of the first amendment have the federal government tell the states what to do. that was on the matter of spousal ification.  in this amendment he tells the local communities. specifically the school boards. what they should do. which brings me to the first and probably the most important point as to why i object to the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina the fact is that schoolbased clinics are  an invention of the federal government. they are  a philanthropic organization. rather. they are there at the instance of the local school board. it is the local school board that places these clinics in the schools. the federal government has hing to do with it whatsoever. it seems to me that is exactly where the decision ought to be. in local hands. some commumities choose to do it and some do mind you. these are separate and apart from title x family planning clinics. the two are totally separate. these clinics come about because the local school board has come to the conclusion that the services needed are best located within the school setting. these clinics provide a broad range of services. including treatment of mi injuries. immunizations. athletic physicals. primary health care. and yes. in some instances. they also might be involved in giving advice to teenagers visavis the matter of pregnancy. et cetera. to me. this makes uncommon sense for all those who object to family planning clinics. or the government going ahead and giving advice. what is supposed to happen. hing. what about the local community. the local school board should decide tie best course of action insofar as their children are concerned. if there are anything that falls in tune with the philosophy of my distinguished colleague from th carolina and this adininistration. i daresay most of us on this floor say let the local school boards make the decisions. and  tile federal government. i might add i do  sit here divorced from this process in the u.s. senate. i also happen to be a father. i have children age 5. two of them 9 years of age. one 10 years of age. one age 22. one age 27 and one age 30. and i have been involved in all of their lives. i want the local community. even  for my youngest. to go ahead and make those decis.ions to give them the information. and to give them the help that they need in the year 1988. 1 daresay that information and that assistance in the year 1988 for the 5year old. the 9year olds.. and the 10year old is considerably different than that whi(l was needed for the 22. 27 and 30year olds. that is the advantage of the locality making the decisions. they can adapt to new circumstances. and to new needs. that is what tie schoolbatsed clinic is all about. it is  a secret sex clinic. really. let us stop trivializing the health of this nations children with these sort of sensationalistic phrases. when we were talking about title x. these phrases come up. and they continue to cone up with tile schoolbased clinics. it is agreed by everybody that if we amc going to go ahead and control in any way unwanted teenage pregnancy. this lhas to be done at thie source. i wish as i said before that families w (re doing this job. and in many cases they do. but where the problem lies is with the parents who are  giving that type of advice. and that is the reason why title x and family planning (omen along. but in this instance. it. is only one narrow aspect of the ..choolbased health clinics might address that particular problem. these clinics encompass a whole range of health services and advice under (he control of the local school board. if there are those who -ay the pederal government should lieve role. who does this job. who doe.. it.. are we being told here is (.iy does it. or is it 100 senators who want to go ahead and do the job in absent ia iii c. ry community in tihe jnited states. this trend. i might add. is ju.t like the trend in medicine as a whole. to bring it down to tie smrallest. mot personal type of unit. just ws in tile case of mental health. we have gone from institutions to communitybased settings.  what we are saying in the case of the health of our youngsters. as we are moving away from a federal program to local programs. these clinicsand i repeat to my colleagues. for those who are off the floorare always developed with the approval of the local school board. and with the input coning from parent3 and other community members. the decision as to what services each clinic will offer are determined at the local level. if school boards and parents do  want to offer family planning servicer hey are under absolutely obligation to do so. while there are federal maternal and child health funds. as well as medicaid funds. which go to these clinics. title x funds are being expended surprising. since few clinics offer family planning services. if adopted. this anendment would severely diminish the communitys flexibility to initiate local programs. to address the problems of teen pregnancy and inadequate prenatal care among adolescent mothers. there are communities where that is the prime concern. and it is a valid concern. we k that from the statistics. so i hope that. as i indicated before. we bring the arguments back  to the realm of reality. we are coming very far afield from those days where the division still exists as to the matter of abortion. we are  getting into every personal aspect of family life. i do  want anybody telling me as to how our morals have slipped. i like to think i have a very fine family. and i am sure most of my colleagues feel the same way. our problems are different from those of our children. i am very proud of the kids of this nation. the fact that it is drugs in this generation rather than the alcohol of ours. they are both problcns. they are both devastating to the humnanity that. is involved. there is point. ill pointing a finger and saying how great we are and how bad they are. in any event. i do k this: the problem is best answered at home. i am entirely consistent in my argunients. yes. i contest the senator for th carolina when ile tries to impose religion on my children visavis the federal government. the fedcral government has role. that is roy job as a parent. it is tire job of my particular faith. it is  the job of tie u.s. senate. the character and morals of my children is my job. that is the job of my community. it is  the job of the u.s. senate. the health care of my kids is ny job. the physicians job. the schools job. it is  the job of the u.s. senate to say what is needed and what i:  necedcd. when you start substituting moralizing for science. we are iii pretty tough shape in this country. i respect. as few others do. the individuality of every american citizen. and i do  want the federal government saying how my kids should pray. what kind of health care they ire going to get. what the problems are within my family setting or my community. what is ironic in all this is that these words come from those who are conservative: in other words. who want their points of view imposed on others. there is absolutely direction from the federal government as to how the funds involved here ought to be used. e. they are to be used for the wellbeing of our chiiiren as determined by the local school board. if he wants tr eliminate the funds entirely. fine. eliminate then. and say that thre federal government will have role in this. that is fair egh. but stop saying what it is tire local school board and the commnnity or. rather. the school clinic is going to do or  do. you are telling the centers for disease control what they can do and can do. you are telling the schoolbased clinics what they can do and can do. you are telling the various schools what they can do and can do so far as belief is concerned. our job is to set general policy.  to meddle and interfere with the indvidual lives of the citizenry. certainly. so far as this amendment is concerned. it should fall on the basis of what will  be achieved if the amendment sueceeds. the whole program goes out the window. the money is  available to any community. and therefore services that ody would disagree with are eliminated. and services that are desperately needed in certain comnrnunity settings are eliminated. this is  an abortion program. this is rrot even a family planning prograin. it is health. and that. believe me. is best determined at the local level. that is what this is all about. at tie appropriate tine. as i indicated. i will move to table the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina. i do  want to do so until he has the opportunity to regain the floor and make any cornments lie wants or that any other senator may wish to make.
. there is a ready remedy available to disgruntled parents who disagree with the school board. and that is to vote them out of office. that is exactly the remedy that is available to us as americans under our constitutional system. i would suggest that the matter is  secret. that usually if such a clinic is being considered in the community. it is probably the subject matter of riproaring debate at town meetings or whatever. or it is the result of pleading. if you will. to make sure that adequate health measures are applied to the children in that particular community. in any event. is there anyone else who is desiring to speak on this matter. if . i move to table the amendment of the distinguished senator from th carolina and ask for the yeas and nays.
i thank the senator. for a number of years. there has been a great deal of discussion about the need for soundproofing in neighborhoods located near airports. particularly in those facilities where children are trying to learn and where sick people are trying to get well. but to this date. there is still hard data on which we can make reasonable estimates of the costs of such an undertaking and the potential benefits. we need to k for example the precise level of unacceptable se. the numbers of schools and hospitals located in this environment. the numbers of students and patients in these facilities. and the estimated costs of undertaking soundproofing programs.
 of tufts university. chairman of the white house conference on food nutrition and health in 1969. the leading nutritionist in america and one of the ackledged specialists in nutrition in the world. in this article. dr. mayer expertly discusses the objections to school food vending machines being allowed to sell junk food to our school children. with good reason. dr. mayer calls for senate support of an amendment which the distinguished senator from new jersey. senator case. will be offering to s. 1420. the school nutrition bill which we will act upon this week. this amendment would give the secretary of agriculture the power to regulate the contents of school vending machines. i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record.
i agree with the distinguished chairman. he is absolutely correct. we have had expert testimony in either house on this subject. this is  a proper subject to come before the appropriations committee. because. as the senator has said time and time again. it is legislation on an appropriations bill. it is a matter that should come up in the authorizing committees. where there would be hearings. with the kind of information that i read from letters i have received from the american medical association and from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists. they should have appeared before the committee and testified. every year this matter comes before us on this appropriations bill. which is wrong. we have said time and time again that this is wrong. and we hope that the proper authorizing committees some day will have the courage to stand up. hold hearings on it. vote upon it. and let us k what we should do. we are here faced with the same issue we were faced with the year before and probably will be faced with next year.
. the amendment. i believe. is selfexplanatory. i favor the bill. its purposes. and the result which would be accomplished by it. i think that in two respects. however. it should be changed. both are embodied in this amendment. the amendment would strike out the provision for a 20year requirement or condition as to the use of the property. it would require that the property be used by the state of arkansas as a vocational rehabilitation center or for other public health or other educational purpose without time limit. and provides for a reverter in the event that that condition is breached. the other part of the amendment. a breach of which also would result in reverter. is to require the state of arkansas to operate the facility without discrimination. segregation. or unequal treatment to any person because of race. color. religion. or national origin. i do  intend to wave the flag about this or to attempt to be oratorical at all. i think the facts. the history. and all the rest of the surrounding circumstances are clear evidence without any more words by me that the amendment is necessary if we intend to achieve our desired result. and i have doubt whatever that all the members of the senate would want to have this result reached. so i urge that the amendment which i have offered be adopted.
i think the senator has stated only a part of the objections. it must be used either as a rehabilitation center or for other purposes. such as health or educational purposes. if the objection were that it should be used only as a vocational center. and if that meant a vocational center of the kind that could only be operated with the assistance of the federal government. i think there would be considerable point in the suggestion that has been made that the regulations of the department of health. education. and welfare might govern and avoid any problem of segregation. but it need  even be operated as a rehabilitation center. any public health or recreational service is sufficient to avoid a revester during the 20year period. and after the 20 years there is condition whatsoever.
. the response to my bill has been wide and overwhelmingly favorable. among the many letters i have received is one from dr. dewitt stetten. jr.. dean of the rutgers medical school at new brunswick. n.j. i ask unanimous consent that the letter and several articles and editorials be printed in the record.
the republican memb~ers of the subcommittee support the amendment and we are very happy to say so. on a personal e. i support it strongly. we need this money in southern new jersey for a new medical school and i am sure for other things. while i can make the speech our chairman made or add the weight his support will bring to the amendment. what little i can do i offer.
. public interest in good nutrition has grown considerably in recent years and attention has been directed to what can be done in schools to teach children proper nutritional practices. one inative program has been carried on by miss lynn ketcham. a nutritionist in washington. d.c. i ask unanimous consent that an article on miss ketchams project which appeared in the sunday star be printed in the record.
s committee on education beyond the high school. i hope very much. king the caliber of the men concerned. they will stand fast by that item in conference. we have 1.400.000 boys and girls who are expected to graduate from high school this year. by 1965 the number will be in excess of 2 million. by 1970 it will be about 2.200.000. yet we find that about 200.000 students who are of college caliber have difficulty in trying to attend college for financial reasons. and about 100.000 in the gifted category. who could be leaders in sciences and professions. will  be able to attend college because of financial difficulties. such a situation cries aloud for action on a loan bill for college students. such as i have sponsored. or a socalled college bill. which has been sponsored by others. such action certainly demands the greatest priority. even as an elementand i think this is writing it down considerably. but it still must be saidin the anticommunist struggle. the soviet union graduates twice as many engineers as we do. it trains students from other countriesone of the most critical elements of foreign policy in which we could engageto the number of about 250.000. while we train 36.000. which is a new high. i commend the committee for some recognition of this problem and for giving consideration to the matter. i think also the committee has done splendidly in giving attention to libraries and hospitals. particularly in rural areas. which are necessary to bring the cultural level of the country even higher than it is. moreover. the committee has done very well with respect to the matter of the organized trucking industry and the administration of the minimumwage levels on federal highway construction. i should like to address a question to the chairman of the subcommittee upon one matter. and that relates to the provision contained in the bill for dental research. i think the committee is to be commended for its recognition of the critical contribution to health of dental research. i should like to suggest to the chairman of the subcommittee that some reply should be given to the dental societies. especially the american dental society and the dental society of the state of new york. which feel that attention should have been given to the recommendation for an appropriation of $3.700.000 for construction of a research building for a national institution of dental research. i might say to the chairman of the subcommittee that the reference made to that question is at page 854 of the hearings. relating to a preliminary appropriation for planning of the building. i hasten to add that i am  in any way finding fault. but i feel that when such a great body of professional people express an interest. some reply ought to be given to them.
. there is a critical need for this additional statutory condition for two reasons: one. there exists intolerable discrimination in fact in admissions policy on racial grounds among the institutions to be benefited. and two. the department of health. education. and welfare. based upon its interpretation of other acts similar to this bill. would if it were passed in its present form. feel obliged to aid these discriminating institutions. under these circumstances there is alternative but to press this amendment. the factual issue is an open record and a shocking one: of the approximately 87 accredited medical schools in the united states. at this time there are 6 which continue to maintain a policy of  admitting negroes: the university of mississippi. baylor university. the medical college of alabama. the medical college of south carolina. the medical college of georgia. and louisiana state university. this group represents the hard core of resistance to the desegregation trend which began in higher educa.tion long before the elementary and high school cases involved in the historic brown against board of education decision in 1954. which ended the separatebutequal doctrine.
it should be ed that the pamphlet lists approximately 1.100 schools of professional nursing of all types and among those which are   covered by the billbecause they are hospitalconnected.  collegeconnected schoolsthe percentage of schools designated as  admitting negroes is even higher than that which i have shown above. it should also be ed that in testimony on the bill the department stated that it intended to extend the program at a later date to the hospitalconnected schools. thus even without regard to all the other types of school which would be covered by the bill. the medical and nursing school patterns alone show significant discrimination problems as a matter of plain fact. the even more insidious problem. of racial and religious quotas in schools which do  openly maintain a policy against admission. must be added to the equation. too. the second major point is that. although there is an abundance of legal authority to the effect that executive departments and agencies have  only the legal right but a constitutional duty to withhold federal funds from segregated or discriminatory activities. and although most of the departments and agencies ackledge that right and duty in connection with most of their activities. the department of health. education. and welfare. along with the department of agriculture. refuses to ackledge such power. in april and may of this year. along with senator philip a. hart. i sent carefully prepared letters to each of the departments and agencies asking whether they believed further legislation was necessary in order to prevent the use of federal funds in violation of the constitution in the programs administered by them. on july 10. 1963. i placed the answers i reanalyzed them. in almost all cases the answer was that sufficient authority already exists to cut off such funds. but the department of health. education. and welfare. which will administer this new program. did  answer and at this point has still  answered the policy question. they have recently stated. in a letter to me. that in various programs which they administer they believe they do have such authority and are exercising it. as to the remaining programs they are silent. however.- in testimony this year before a house subcommittee on a bill to cut off federal funds under existing educational programs from segregated institutions. the departments spokesman quite clearly stated that the department feels it must pick and choose between statutory language in different acts which it administersin some cases the statutory language suggests to them that they have discretion as to the way in which the funds are used and in some cases it suggests the contrary. the crux of the problem. apparently. is the very kind of language which again appears in this new medical education bill in section 726. which prohibits interference by the federal government in the administration of any institution. it is just this sort of language which the department has repeatedly relied upon in refusing to exercise what many legal experts believe is firmly based upon constitutional authoritythe right to deny funds to segregated institutions. and the congress would again. at this momentous time in the civil rights struggle. set the clock back by letting stand this same language in the new program which is  before the senate and failing to make its intentions clear with regard to it. i think the department is completely wrong as a matter of law in its interpretation of this language. because the bill provides that they shall  interfere in the administration of an institution if they are giving aid. but we are talking about whether they shall give aid at all. if they deny aid. they are  interfering in any way. nevertheless. this completely false interpretation of lawand i make that statement advisedly as a lawyer of considerable experiencepersists in the department of health. education. and welfare. therefore. if we are to make clear the intention of congress in this particular case. that we will  accept an administration of the statute which will pay money to aid discrimination on racial grounds. the only way we can do it is by so declaring in the law itself. because of the position taken by this particular government department. . i have asked the department to state its position. if it has any position other than that which we glean from its. testimony on. a number of other statutes and from its testimony before this particular committee. it should say so. i ask unanimous consent that my letter to the secretary of health. educa.tion. and welfare dated september 5. asking the question specifically. which has had reply. withstanding a number of oral requests that it should be replied to in advance of this date. be printed at this point in the record.
the bill would  affect that situation one way or the other. that. i think. is the purpose. it would  affect a situation in which there is segregation through a dental of the opportunity to attend a public school mally assigned.
. abraham lincoln a century ago sounded the responsibility of the government "to care for him who has borne the battle." this bill seeks to apply that eloquent standard to the veterans of vietnam and to those who have stood ready to serve their nation during these times of crisis. however. as the distinguished sponsor of the cold war gi bill. senator yarborough. has pointed out. this measure falls short of its promise. for example. the monthly education allowance of $100 for current veterans is less than the $110 per month allowed under the korean gi bill despite the fact that college costs have risen. and continue to rise. at the rate of some 5 percent each year and the cost of living has risen considerably since the korean gi bill was enacted in 1952. it is heartening to k that senator yarborough. as chairman of the veterans affairs subcommittee. intends to next year seek improvement of this and other shortcomings in the present bill. there is one further matter of particular concern to me. namely. the adequacy of facilities for veterans. in the past year. there has been a diminution of the facilities providing services to veterans. hospitals. domiciliary centers and service centers.  we are faced with upwards of 240.000 veterans annually availing themselves of the new educational benefits and many thousands more availing themselves of the hospital and other benefits for which they are  eligible. we are to be continually faced with the question of whether existing facilities are adequate to the task. i am hopeful. thereforeand suggest to the veterans affairs subcommitteethat a close and continued oversight will be conducted over these va facilities to make certain that they are adequate to the responsibilities which they must  undertake under the new and heavier loads imposed by this bill. one final e. this bill. as did the predecessor gi bills. permits foreign study for veterans. but there is an inconsistency with other education aid programs enacted by the congress. similar provisions are  included. for example. despite the shortage of doctors in this nation. young americans studying abroad can avail themselves of the benefits available under the health professions educational assistance act. we must. i believe. find the means to assist the foreign study of these other young americans by making available to them. where possible. the benefits of student aid programs  available for domestic study only. it is my intention to seek to amend the pending international education proposal accordingly. finally. i was pleased to arrange with the senator from texas . who is the sponsor of the bill. for a poll of the members of the subcommittee in order to obtain a consensus on a conference bill. the senator from texas has brought the house amendment up by motion and urges the adoption of the house amendment. i urge that the senate follow that recommendation and take such action.
i thank my colleague from texas very much. . . i shall deal briefly with title ii of the bill. which sets the seal of urgency in establishing a national commitment to put an end to malnutrition in america by authorizing grantsinaid to assist medical schools. graduate schools. universities. hospitals. and other public or private institutions in more effectively dealing with the problems of malnutrition. by advancing medical kledge in the causes and effects of malnutrition. providing for the early detection and effective treatment of malnutrition. and enhancing student assistance programs in the field of malnutrition. the malnutrition title of this bill was originally introduced by me as a separate bill. s. 1865. and cosponsored by senators
. these commutations will serve to ease the relationships between nations and to demonstrate that this is  quite as callous a world as many would suppose and that indignation can move even those with seemingly flinty hearts to some compassion. however. deeper than that. i hope that these events and the way in which they have moved our country and the world will move the soviet union to take a really hard look at the treatment accorded the citizens of the jewish faith. we of the united states. having our own miities. k that such a reexamination is  an easy task. but any shortrun discomfort experienced in probing the national conscience is more than compensated for by the longterm returns in the health and vigor of the society. the sages once observed that he who saves one life is considered as if he preserved the entire world. we are all heartened by the news from moscow and madrid this morning. and are hopeful that it is more a portent of more humanity for the future than a gesture for the present. a call to eliminate the persecution of jews and other miities in the soviet u could be a true harbinger of a new attitude toward individual freedom in the soviet union and new relations with the rest of mankind and contribute emously to relieve the world from the fears of confrontations. the real issue is whether those who wish to emigrate and reunite with their families in israel and other places will be permitted to do so. the soviet union should look deeply into its own soul and learn from the experience of the worlds reaction how much it can profit from letting these people go. and it would introduce a e of humanity into its own operations.
. i urge my colleagues to support the passage of h.r. 7736 as amended. in order to extend for 1 year the health manpower provision. including nursing. student loan and scholarship provisions of the public health service act. any significant delay in their extension would have serious detrimental effects on the enrollment of urgently needed medical. dental. nursing. and other health manpower students. the committee on labor and public welfare. of which i am ranking miity member. has recently ordered to be reported a health manpower bill. s. 934. and a nursing bill. s. 1747. which would continue with modificationsthe current program of student loans and scholarships. and include an additional program of guaranteed loans and scholarships as proposed in the bill which i introduced for the administration. s. 1183. there would be conflict between the enactment of this bill. h.r. 7736. and the comprehensive legislation on this subject which the committee ordered reported. s. 934 and s. 1747. the comprehensive health manpower and nursing bills are prepared to take into account the enactment of h.r. 7736. if the student loans and scholarship programs were curtailed. it would become a barrier to academically qualified but financially disadvantaged applicants. schools might  be able to plan for their 1971 entering class in september. therefore. i urge my colleagues promptly to extend the existing law in order that the student loan and scholarship programs can be continued.
 has more of a right to have his chosen assistant. my deep interest is in the hunger and nutrition programsin the school lunch program. in the food stamp program. in the school breakfast program and other nutrition programs. i was the ranking member of the senate committee on hunger and nutrition. i have had a discussion with dr. butz and had it expressly in the light of a speech he gave last april in which he seemed to criticize the programs to which i have just referred. and in which he specifically referred to a trip taken by senator mcgovern to florida to investigate hunger problemsa trip. incidentally. of which i was a part. as a member of the senate hunger and nutrition committee. after discussing this matter with dr. butz. i felt that the talk he gave was mainly directed toward the point that we americans have a tendency. when we are for something to drive it and drive it and drive it until it might become an excessive preoccupation with us. and that we manifest that in our action. i might  agree. but i can understand that it did  necessarily represent a basic policy deficiency so far as his administration of the department would be concerned. i  have a letter from dr. butz bearing out my conclusion that. under all the circumstances presented. i should support him. and i should like to read the letter into the record. it is addressed to me. and it reads:
it is woefully inadequate in how it relates to the future. how does hunger 1 relate to education. how does venereal disease relate to school dropouts. how does drug addiction relate to the ability or desire to hold a job and the degree of antagonism and the ability to be rehabilitated so as to be able to hold a job. -
. while our country continues to strive toward the ideal of equal opportunity and freedom of career choice. there remains an area which deserves greater public attentionthe career opportunities available to women who desire to become physicians. women must  be denied the equal opportunity to compete with their peers for the limited but expanding numbers of medical school openings. we must insure that americas doctors are the very best in the world without regard to sex or other prejudicial discrimination. a recent article published in parents magazine by virginia sadock. m.d.. entitled "where are the women doctors our country needs." dramatizes u.s. efforts in comparison to the progress in other nations. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record.
. the state college of optometry. state university of new york. located in new york city. is the first such optometric school in the state. it has been a sorely needed facility. we have been excited about its creation. the annced budget cuts in federal funding for the schools and colleges of optometry presents an omis situation for all 12 schools. the life of the fledgling new york institution may  be in question. surely the quality and scope of its programs are. capitation funds for the state college of optometry are utilized for planning. coordination. evaluation and implementation of academic and clinical programs. although a part of the state educational system. as you k new york has reached the same type of crisis in budgeting we see on the federal level. great chunks of aid seem forthcoming on the state level. in addition to capitation funding. the cessation of the schools special project grant would eliminate all personnel involved in miity recruitment and thus effectively eliminate the program. this is an area which has seen great promise in optometric education in general. so many of these students seem determined to practice in the disadvantaged areas of the country. those communities suffering the most from lack of adequate health personnel. with reduction in scholarships and loans. these very students will find even more difficulty in obtaining the wherewithal to proceed with their education. certainly financial ability should  become the only criterion for admission into professional schools. this new educational policy may force this day upon us. some try to tell us that there is shortage of competent vision care specialists in the nation today. that may very well be truealthough i doubt it. this fiscal policy in relation to these 12 schools and colleges would create that shortage in very short order. as federal funds vanish from the academic scene. the schools will be forced to reduce their enrollments. in a desperate attempt to reduce costs. in reducing those costs. the quality of education may well be compromised. the investment in optometric education is small from the federal standpoint. the dividends are great for they concern the health of the people of this nation. the people we represent. by means should we abandon this needed aspect of health education. we need all the trained health care practitioners we can reasonably educate.
. drug abuse in our country has been increasing. we can longer tolerate the continuation of what is basically a one dimensional response to a three dimensional problem. we must continue to focus fiscal and -human resources on clinically oriented programs such as methadone maintenance and therapeutic communities to combat heroin addiction. however. in the -face of changing patterns of drug abuse. we. are longer justified in expending drug program resources in this singular area of heroin addiction. we are seeing . in this country. the development of a frightening pattern of polydrug use. young people. even at the junior and senior high school levels. are taking drugs in combinationamphetamines. barbituates. tranquilizers and others. frequently mixed with alcohol. while we do need to develop some clinical treatment models for youngsters so deeply enmeshed in polydrug use as to be rendered functional. we should fail to heed the major lesson to be learned from our experience in dealing with the drug abuse problem over the past few years: the drug abuse problem can be solved by our simply dealing with its ultimate manifestation in the individual. that is addiction or crippling polydrug use. the abuse of any substance is complex human behavior which is influenced by many forces: school. family. church. community. media peer group pressure. we must undertake the development of educational program models that utilize the resources of all of these in order to affect drug taking behavior before it reaches the final stage. one where already overburdened and often still uncertain health professionals must be called upon again for a solution. we must undertake early intervention and primary prevention activities. aimed at helping experimenters and users out of the "taken" category before taking becomes "abusing." and at helping the troubled youngster who. even though a user. may be headed for trouble with drugs because of their abundance and easy accessibility. because of peer pressure to conform. to join. to belong. and because of the more general but equally strong overall pressure in our society to opt for the chemical solution to lifes problems. the community at large. and the schools particularly. are in the best position to focus on the causes of drug abuse rather than the symptoms. to reflect their own specialized needs. and to plan and develop responsive early intervention and prevention programing. criticisms of socalled drug education efforts have been leveled at programs which have focused for the most part on providing massive amounts of information. very often to bored or hostile audiences. such criticism is well directedbut  because education does  work. rather because information is  education. drug education should be a total process of interaction between individuals which emphasizes the effective as well as the cognitive approach. a process in which drug information is utilized as a nutritive ingredient for the mutualistic growth of teacher and student alike. to the end of involving the student in intellectual. cultural. and social alternatives to drug use. that such programs can be run successfully has been demonstrated by several school team approaches  being utilized around the country.  the least of these is one from my own state. the spark program in new york city. interestingly. its success is due in large measure to its meaningful use of students themselves as "teachers" in the overall educational process. the u.s. office of education has been training community teams to develop intervention and prevention responses. it has provided special training workshops for teacher training institutions. it is trying to relate responsibility to a far broader -approach to "the drug problem" than is manifested by a simplistic focus upon the individual already addicted to hard drugs. we must relate to this broader approach as well. we need a drug education bill  because we have proved scientifically that drug education works. but rather because we hope that given adequate time and support it can. and because given the scope of our drug problem and the lessons of experience. we k it must. to accomplish that goal i am introducing with senators hughes. williams and dominick the "alcohol and drug abuse education act." which provides as follows: first-$90 million over 3 years is authorized for the secretary to make grants and contracts with. institutions of higher education. state and local educational agencies. and public and private education or community agencies. institutions. and organizations to support and evaluate demonstration projects and to disseminate these nationally. to train educational and community personnel that have or should have an important influence on the behavior of young people and to provide technical assistance in program development. second. authorizes such funds to be available for activities such ascomprehensive demonstration programs in schoolcommunities which focus on the causes of drug and alcohol abuse rather than the symptoms. which emphasize the effective as well as the cognitive approach. which reflect the specialized needs of local communities and which involve. in planning and development. school personnel. the target population. community representation and parents. creative primary prevention and early intervention programs in schools utilizing an interdisciplinary "school team approach" to prepare educational personnel together with students better to respond to the drug and alcohol problems in the schools by developing in them skills in planning comprehensive school drug abuse prevention programs to include such activities as peer group and individual counseling. group leadership training. rap groups. training of drug and alcohol education specialists. student involvement in intellectual. cultural. and social alternatives to drug and alcohol use. grants to state educational departments to support specific projects forinservice training of educational personneltechnical assistance to local school districts--creative leadership in programing for indiges miitiestraining of peer counselors. evaluations of the effectiveness of such programs. preservice and inservice training programs on drug and alcohol abuse prevention for teachers. counselors and other educational personnel. law enforcement officials and other public service and community leaders and personnel. training of educational personnel in the selection and use of support materials in drug and alcohol abuse prevention. community education programs on drug and alcohol abuse especially for parents and others. as appropriate. in the community. evaluations of such training and community education programs including the examination of the intended and actual impact of such programs. the identification of strengths and weaknesses in such programs and the evaluation of materials used in such programs. programs or projects to recruit. train. organize and employ professionals and other persons including former drug and alcohol abusers or drug and alcohol dependent persons to organize and participate in programs of public education in drug and alcohol abuse. and projects for the dissemination of valid and effective schoolcommunity drug and alcohol abuse education programs. the bill is distinguished from the recent housepassed bill--except that it retains the same total 3year authorization of $90 million and specifically includes alcoholism within drug abuseas follows: the title of the bill is amended to read "alcohol and drug abuse education act" to reflect the focus of the inclusion of support for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependency within drug abuse. in lieu of the $100.000 grants to each state education department and the funding priority provisions single grant authority is provided for educational entities and community programs. it includes authority to make grants to state education departments to support specific proposals. and other enumerated programs eligible for funding support to achieve the desired goals as set forth in sections 3 (a) and (b) of the bill. the purpose clause of the act is amended to conform to the grant authorities established by the bill. i am concerned that drug abuse education has been professionally. politically and ecoically exploited and could be more so by the $100.000 grants to each state. there have been numerous criticisms of prior drug abuse education activities. for example. the department has identified states where all of the funds are channeled to individual communities to carry out programs with little direction or monitoring of results. and technical assistance and evaluation. in one" instance the bulk of the funds has gone to support one big workshop for educational personnel during the summer with subsequent followup. some states are still plying the traditional cognitive approach to drug education with predictable results. in one instance a good portion of funds was spent on a tv series which was abandoned after production. traditional workshops are still a basic part of some states programs. there tend to be instances of political infighting and redtape which can jeopardize funding effectiveness. a number have reported significant unspent funds at the end of a project year. also. there is a need for welltrained leadership at the state as well as at the local level. the bill i introduced today with senators hughes. williams. and dominick will provide the opportunity to avoid such problems by focusing limited resources where they can be most effective. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the record. also. i ask unanimous consent that a recent evaluation of the new york spark drug education program. which in great measure contributed to the development for the criteria of this bill. be printed in the record.
. i join in introducing with senator schweiker on behalf of the administration the comprehensive health professions education act of 1975. which is cosponsored by senators kentedy. and willlams. at the same time. i am joining in the introduction with senators kennedy. schweiker. and williams of four other separate bills: first. the kennedy/javits health lanpower bill of the 93d congress as favorably reported by the committee on labor and public welfare. having deleted germane provisions. second. the housepassed bill. third. the bill introduced in the 93d congress by former congressman roy. which utilizes student assistance as the sole funding mechanism. and fourth. a bill drafted by the association of american colleges based upon the recommendations of its task force. all of the bills have one common themethey recognize that the health professions schools are a national resource which must be supported through the federal tax dollar and. at the same time. that if such support is to be provided that the nation has the right to expect that these schools will make vital contributions to the solutions of the problems of shortages and geographic and specialty maldistributions of physicians. dentists. and other health professionals. senators kennedy. schweiker. williams. and i have agreed to introduce all these bills so that the congress can draw from all of them to develop the most effective response in the public interest to the problems. the senatepassed bill of the 93d congressthe substitute to the committee reported bill by senator beallis  being introduced at this time since senator beall will soon introduce that bill. i believe a reasonable compromise on the issues can be effectuated: i would recommend that we consider a division of capitation support. a percentage available to the schoolsto provide appropriate. stable financial supportwith the schools required to meet only limited conditions. for example. increased enrollment and the establishment of the necessary primary medical care responses. the balance. a form of bonus capitation. available when a school could assure the secretary that itbased upon the senatepassed substitute provisionwould have a 25percent minimum student commitment for service. upon completion of education and training. in medically underserved areas. an additional form of bonus capitation support would be provided to each schoolon a pro rata basisfor increased percentages of enrolled students who agree to such service. i would recommend we consider adoption of the provisions of the senatepassed bill which seeks to limit effectively the number of foreign medical graduates through immigration and naturalization act restrictions. and that the waiver provisions in that restrictive authority approach be reconsidered. i believe it would be appropriate to adopt the house provision with respect to specialty training limitations. but it is essential that the authority be vested in the secretary. rather than the private sector as the house bill provides. however. it would be up to that same private sector. acting in cooperation and coordination wi~h the secretary. to develop the necessary accreditation expertise and requirements regarding specialty training. my concerns about the administration bill are similar to those i expressed in the 93d congress. i ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the record at this point.
s supplemental request. and $100 million above the house recommendations. these proposed levels reflect a continuing and necessary commitment to federal efforts to provide direct benefits to all our nations people. in health. for example. the senate committee recommendations include fiscal year 1977 regular appropriations for health manpower programs. and important increases over the house in programs to fund alcoholism grants throughout the states. as well as allied health and public health programs. in education. the senate committee proposes increases above the house for inative programs to assist school district desegregation under new provisions of the emergency school aid act. as well as in several programs providing student and institutional assistance in higher education. including restoring recommended 1977 appropriations for the national direct student loan program to their full 1976 level of $321 million. important increases above the house are also recommended for programs to assist our nations college and university libraries. and to improve activities in educational guidance. counseling. and testing. i am also pleased to e that the senate committee has recommended a total of $282.5 million to help lowincome families respond effectively to their basic energy needs under programs administered through the community services administration. in short. the senate committee has developed recommendations that reflect effective funding levels for a number of programs designed to provide social benefits for our nations people. i commend the members of the committee for their efforts. and urge their continued consideration in these vital areas.
. today the senate is voting upon a very important and worthwhile piece of legislationthe national school lunch act and child nutrition amendments of 1977. i would like to comment on several aspects of the bill that i feel are particularly importantthe nutrition education program. the limitation on sale of competitive foods. and the summer food service program. i commend my colleagues of the committee for creating strong nutrition components in the committee bill. provision of food is  alone sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of our nations children. a nutritionally adequate diet is essential. evidence abounds of the lack of kledge in our nations youth about good nutrition. the committee bill addresses the problem through comprehensive programs in the states  only for nutrition education programs for the children but training for teachers and school food service personnel in the delivery of these programs. with a greater kledge of proper nutrition. children will be less likely to reject nutritious foods for empty calories and will establish more appropriate eating habits that can be of lifelong benefit. to reinforce the learning provided through the nutrition education programs. the committee bill empowers the secretary of agriculture to ban low nutritional competitive foods during periods federal food programs are in operation. the federal government should  be spending millions to educate our children in proper nutrition while permitting food providers the privilege of counteracting these teachings through the sale of socalled junk foods. and such a ban would have a beneficial side effect in decreasing waste of food by children obtaining school lunches and yet filling up with low nutritional foods. the summer food service program is also a vital part of our nations effort to guarantee adequate nutrition for millions of children. yet it has been beset by abuses that throw a pall over its accomplishments. i commend the committee for its excellent work in favorably reporting a bill that addresses the needs of children and yet provides stringent administrative controls in order to prevent the reoccurence of last years abuses. the bill achieves this balance by insuring that all eligible sponsors are entitled to participate but requiring that they meet specific standards of competence. sponsors must show adequate administrative and financial capabilities. they must have a clean record in past program operation. and they must provide yearround service to the local community. yet the bill exempts from the yearround service requirement lowincome areas which would  otherwise be served by the program. in the case of sponsors comueting to feed the same children. a priority system has been devised. giving preference to sponsors with good prior records. to sponsors with onsite meal preparation. and to those utilizing school food service facilities. these various requirements. and others which i will describe shortly. take away the false ion of license for anyone to do what they will with the program. programmatic accountability has been firmly grounded in congressional understanding that all eligible sponsors are entitled to participate so that the effort to feed needy children can be undertaken carefully and promptly. some critics of the program point to the imbalance of funds reaching our major cities as opposed to our smaller cities and rural areas. the bill answers this argument by mandating that all states must develop. as part of their state plan. a vigorous outreach effort in all areas where needy children remain hungry during the summer months. to assist in this effort. the bill requires state agencies to provide approved sponsors advance funds by june 1. july 15. and august 15. an otherwise good local sponsor should  be discouraged from applying or expanding due to a shortage of initial capital. the amount of advance funds to be made available also reflects the concerns to increase meal quality and encourage selfpreparation of meals. the bill also allows the secretary to provide startup funds for use by sponsors to plan their program 2 months before operations begin. this money encourages sound local program planning. and i expect that the secretary will strongly encourage states to provide such funds to interested sponsors at sufficient levels of funding. lack of funds should  be a barrier to good planning. aher problem which surfaced last year was the disbursement of sponsor administrative reimbursements. because these funds were tied to the number of meals served. some sponsors took advantage of this system by overestimating the number of children participating at a meal site. i am pleased to point out that this bill does  overreact to this problem by cutting back administrative funding levels. but instead requires the secretary to undertake a study of these costs by considering the number of sites. the number of children served and the type of meal preparation. the purpose of this analysis is to develop an equitable reimbursement system which separates administrative funds from food service costs. administrative reimbursements must remain at levels sufficient to cover such expenses. all states will be required to monitor carefully sponsors participation estimates through audits and onsite reviews. similarly. the amount of administrative funds provided to each state has been derived from a formula which separates these expenses from the total number of meals served. small and rural states will  receive sufficient funds to effectively expand and monitor the program. increasing state control and responsibility over local programs does  imply that the rights of local programs have been pushed aside. the bill contains an important provision which gives sponsors the right to appeal arbitrary decisions by a state which led to denial of participation or withholding of reimbursements and advance funds. a fair hearing has long been one of the keystones of our american system of justice and must  be neglected in this program. the hearing process itself must be exueditious. since the program is in operation only during the summer months. we expect the secretary to prescribe hearing schedule guidelines. keeping in mind the necessity for a short timespan from the hearing request to a decision on the issue. the bill also lays to rest the confusion faced by many states as to their responsibilities in administering and developing program expansion. to avoid last minute disorder as to what agency is responsible for conducting the program. a state agency must ify the secretary of agriculture by january 1 each year if it intends  to administer the program. this date will insure that the state agency. or usda if necessary. will indicate its program commitment in sufficient time to develop effective planning. by february 15. the state agency is required to submit its detailed action plan. the plan will be an indispensable tool for usdas monitoring efforts and will act as a valuable method for state selfassessment of program performance. early implementation of the plan and adherence to its deadlines
