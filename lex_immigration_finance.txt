let me say to the senator from ohio that in conference. having served in the house. i can tell the senator  that we can expand it. we can only contract it. because it is new matter introduced only by the senator. therefore. i believe that the conferees are faced with an impossible situation. except for this fact: i presume many questions will come up under the act. and it may very well be that it requires and deserves separate treatment. for example. we have idea as to what the treasury department had in mind when it exempted only new securities and  existing securities. there are canadian stock exchanges which do an extensive business across the border in services. as well as in goods. i therefore believe that we are poking in the dark. i am devoted to the senator from ohio. and i would  stand in his way. i shall interpose objection to the adoption of his amendment. it can be taken to conference. but i believe that we are poking in the dark on this question. at this time. we have ion as to the reach of the basic proposal. even the basic proposal is  covered in the senators amendment.
