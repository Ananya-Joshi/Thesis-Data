i think we have made the point clearly. the press itself has  been pushing for this amendment. i have received almost correspondence pushing the amendment. it is to the credit of the intended beneficiary of the amendment that they have  lobbied on its behalf. let me make clear that there are tax laws in this country which could be used against the press. yet the press can find its protection in the first amendment. there are health laws which could be used to close down the press. as well as fcc regulations. and antitrust laws. and many other laws which are on the books which could obliterate the press. except for the first amendment. the first amendment is there to make sure that legislation will  be used as a vindictive weapon against a press that might be against certain governmental policies. the first amendment stands above all. as the senator from th carolina ks better than anyone in this chamber. and it will protect the press against government interference.
