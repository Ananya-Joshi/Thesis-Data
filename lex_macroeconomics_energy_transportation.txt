. the key point here is that an agreement was reached with the house of representatives. and in that agreement it was that the only change was from the 10 to the 25 percent differential. that was agreed to by all parties. be they tilted toward buy american or tilted toward -buy american. i point out to the distinguished senator from ohio that when the legislation camne over from the house of representatives. with this language that had  been agreed to. but was far more protectionist than what the senate conferees with the house conferees had agreed to. that legislation came over and it was  subject to amendment in the conference report. because the house of representatives had adjourned. it was truly a case of our taking it or leaving it. so although the senator from ohio might say if it had been that way he might have feltconstrained to object. he would  have had much to object to unless hie wanted to send the whole conference report down the drain. which i suspected he would  have done and certainly those who felt just as strongly on the other side did  feel that we should do because this was a piece of legislation that had been fought for so hard and it would have gone by the boards because we went into a new congress when we came back in january. we would have had gone back to square one and had to start all over again. i do  think any responsible member would have adopted that view. the gasoline tax was involved. all the compromises that were involved in the trucking weights that the manager of the bill had been so involved with had all been agreed to. we had a highway program and a bridge construction program that was essential to the future of the nation. i do  think any responsible person would have said. "because my little piece of legislation was  the way i want it i am going to do all i can to kill that legislation."~ -that was  true. the conference report was accepted unanimously i believemaybe the manager can tell meperhaps even on a voice vote. or certainly it was accepted. was that true.

it takes it from the generalmoney that was going into the general funds to pay for general purposes of the country and puts it into a restricted fund where it is going to be appropriated out solely for highways. we have already done that in the bill. there was a 2.5 cent gasoline tax that has been going into the general fund. that is  diverted to the highway trust fund.
to introduce the clinton administrations legislation to reauthorize the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991. or istea. i applaud the administrations proposal as a sincere effort to reauthorize istea under the principles of intermodalism. environmental protection. sound community planning. and safety. that have made this inative transportation act work so well these past 6 years. i do  agree with all of the details of administration planthe formulas used to distribute funds to each state based on the federal fuel taxes collected in that state are an unfortunate departure from the needbased formulas in all other federal programs. the presidents proposal. however. preserves the basic istea framework and represents a good starting point as we begin considering the reauthorization of istea. i also intend to join with a bipartisan group of colleagues later this month to introduce our own proposal to reauthorize istea. this proposal would reauthorize the key provisions of isteawhich was crafted to promote intermodal. ecoically efficient. and environmentally sound incentives in federal transportation policythrough more fully needsbased formulas. istea has worked. and its reauthorization will be more important for the ecoy than any. other transportation bill since the federalaid highway act of 1956. our goal should be  to make a good law better. by mr. kerry (for himself and mr. kennedy):
maybe you did. but the idea that this was adopted by some masquerade. somehow the impression "when my wife goes to the gasoline station she is thinking that all that tax money is going into the highway trust fund and that if we send it anywhere else we are deceiving her." that is sense. it was sense right from the beginning. as i said. in delineating the history of what took place in 1990 and then in 1993.
i am  going to argue against the action that was taken at that time. i think the senator may well be right. that those actions. started a glidepath toward significantly reducing the deficit. all i am saying here is that ody was under any illusions at the time. i am just trying to rebut the statements being made here that what we need is truth in taxation. truth in gasoline taxation. and that this is a great deception to the american people. there was deception. it was absolutely clear in 1993 when those votes were takeni am  arguing with people who voted for or against it. but ody in this chamber was under any illusion that that money was going to build roads or bridges. it was going to go to deficit reduction.

well. the intimation occurred during the discourse by the senator from texas. was that somehow new issues were presented to the senate by the introduction of this amendment. there is new issue. the issue is the same. whether it is the amendment of the senator from maine and the senator from tennessee. or the senator from massachusetts and the senator from connecticut. there is hing new here. the issue is clear. is there to be a matter of choice or are the state and local officials going to be told how their money is to be spent. we understand what the highway trust fund is. all of our energy. thoughts. and money have been directed solely to the area of highways.  the time has come to find what other modes of transportation will unsnarl us from the traffic jams. the major thrust was in the urban areas. there is great need for transportation other than the automobile. this is the issue presented before the committee and this is the issue  being presented before the senate. i repeat. in presenting this amendment to the bill. what is involved here is mobility. consider the arrogance of this lobby called the highway trust fund lobby. who are they. they are the ones who sell the ingredients for a highway system. our job is  to sell anything but mobility on the floor of the senate. that is our job. they have the arrogance to suggest that when we pay our gasoline taxes we expect them to use it for highways. i dare say that there is  one person in 10 who ks what the gasoline tax is going to be used for. i dare say that there is  one in 10 who wants it to be used for highways only. rather than for other modes of transportation. americans want to be able to move. and our legislative work here in the u.s. senate ought to be geared toward that end. that ought to be the basis for our transportation policy. so i would hope the senate would look favorably upon this amendment. in any event. anticipating that which may come later. should we fail here by what i expect would be only a very narrow margin. i shall definitely support the amendment of the distinguished senators from maine and tennessee. i hope the concept of flexibility will be established. as it was by the senate. who last year had the courage to go ahead and establish a choice. and allow diversity in our transportation systems. what a great moment. you talk about leading. about taking the initiative. about bringing back to the senate the legislative branch of government power. that is the way to do it by criticizing the president. but by coming up with a better alternative. we did that last year. i hope we do it again this year.
i want to assure the distinguished chairman of the committee on finance that i have intention of. in any way. trying to delay or defeat the social security bill. i think it is an important piece of legislation. i am very pleased that the chairman of the finance committee feels that this is an important piece of legislation. and also feels further this is legislation that. if we can delay it for aher year and deprive homeowners of this tax credit. which will be an overall boost to our overall energy program. that we ought to do so. . there are many cosponsors of this legislation. and i hope to have a rollcall vote on this particular amendment. putting it on the social security bill. of course. is  something that is sacrosanct. i would be willing. in view of what the senator has said. to withdraw this amendment from the social security bill and. perhaps. reserving the right tomorrow to add it to aher vehicle if my cosponsors do want an upanddown vote on this particular amendment at this time. but i am very pleased to have the assurance of the distinguished chairman of the committee that we could move on this hopefully early in january when we come back. and his assuranceand i certainly accept that assurancethat he would do everything he can possibly do because he believes himself in the merits of this legislation because it is sorely needed. and i think it is good legislation.
. it may be well for me to make a brief statement in regard to the bill and the amendment just stated. which is the vital amendment in the bill. the bill contemplates an increase in the gasoline tax in the district of columbia by 1 cent above what it is  for the period from january 1. 1942. to june 30. 1951. when the bill was introduced in the house the tax was in the same amount. increasing the gasoline tax by 1 cent. that is. from a 2cent tax in the district of columbia to a 3cent tax. and it was so approved by the committee on the district of columbia of the house of representatives. the tax was increased on the floor of the house. however. by 2 cents. to make the total tax in the district of columbia 4 cents a gallon. in addition to the federal tax of 11/2 cents a gallon. the committee on the district of columbia of the senate  recommends that we follow the original recommendation of the district committee of the house. that is to say. that there be an increase of 1 cent a gallon over a 91/2year period. that is based upon the needs of the district of columbia. and is to take care of its major operations in the improvement of its highways. to state the situation in the briefest possible manner. i may say that the gasoline tax in the district of columbia has been 2 cents a gallon. in addition to the federal tax. since the year 1924. and at the present time the average gasoline tax in the united states. on a weighted average basis. is 4 cents a gallon. there is. only one state in the union which has a 2centsagallon tax. on that basis. ever since 1924 the district of columbia has had a small income from its gasoline tax. the effect has been that the district. in spite of its increase in popuiation. has failed to make the major engineering improvements in its highways which are necessary to carry the traffic of the community. the recommendation of the united states public roads administration and the highway director of the district. approved by the national capital parks and planning commission and the commissioners. is that a program of about $35.000.000 in engineering improvements is essential to overcome the delinquency of the district in its own highway improvements during the past 7 years. it has been estimated that this $35.000.000 program could be carried out over a period of 23 years without increasing the gasoline tax. but by that time. of course. the .needs would be tremendously greater. with the 2cent increase in the gasoline tax. the program could be completed in 8 years. under mal conditions that would be the logical step to take. because it is  already about 5 years overdue. in this period. however. when capital improvements in municipalities should be postponed if they can be postponed. when taxes for local purposes should be kept low. if they can be kept low. it is my judgment and that of the committee that the gasoline tax should be increased 1 cent. and  2 cents. and that the period of the program should be extended over a 10year span. the federal government will enter into this program to the extent of a part of the funds because of the developments across the potomac river. which have brought about the necessity for moving a number of these improvements several years ahead of their mal place on the program. when the war department and the navy department buildings are opened on the other side of the potomac river serious bottlenecks will be created in the access roads to those departments. bottlenecks will result. among other places. at the district of columbia entrances to each of the three bridges. it is proposed to open those buildings before the end of 1942. if that is done it is absolutely essential that the access roads be opened and improved so as to handle the traffic. if possible. before the end of 1942. therefore. the federal government is contemplating recognizing these roads as access roads. and bearing a portion of the expense of cutting through those bottlenecks. that entire program can. however. be carried out on the basis of a 1cent increase in the gasoline tax in the district of columbia. spread over a 10year period. with participation by the federal government to the extent agreed upon by the united states public roads administration as its share. therefore it is recommended at this time that the bill as it came from the other house be amended so as to make the increase in the tax 1 cent a gallon instead of 2 cents a gallon. the other amendments are incidental to that matter. i believe the action suggested will enable the district of columbia in the shortest possible time to make the necessary major engineering improvements and also join with the federal government in relieving the congestion which will be cause by the opening of the federal buildings across the potomac river.
