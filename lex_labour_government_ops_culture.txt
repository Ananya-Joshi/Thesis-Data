first of all. it is clear that even five employees are entitled to and should have safety requirements and safety in places in which they work. i want to point out to the senator from nebraska. who has again raised a question about these inspectors and what they can do on the spot. and this troubles a lot of us as to what these inspectory can do on the spot. i will read in part from a labor department fact book about osha what the requirements are and what can and can be done: after the walkaround. the compliance officer discusses with the employer what he has seen and reviews probable violations. the compliance officer then returns to his office. writes his report and discusses it with his area director. the area director or his superiors determine what citations will be issued and what penalties. if any. will be proposed. these are sent to the employer by certified mail with a copy to the complainant. if there is one. the compliance officer may . on his own. impose or propose a penalty "on the spot" at an inspection  can he close down an establishment or process. osha can act quickly in the courts to deal with imminent danger situations. . time and time again when there is an attempt to delete the effectiveness of osha the argument is used that these inspectors can close them down on the spot. the fact is that they can. yesterday. the senate voted on an amendment which reduced the penalty for serious violations from $1.000 to $50. today. we have had an amendment on the floor that would wipe out the additional inspectors. we only have inspectors  for 5 percent of the businesses in this nation. there are 5 million businesses in the nation and we are only. with the inspectors we have at the present time. servicing about 5 percent if the bill goes through. that will be increased to only 7 percent. so we are only making 120.000 inspections a year.
