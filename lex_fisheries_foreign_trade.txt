the office of international trade has in the first instance complete responsibility for issuing the license and al~o establishing shipping quotas. but they m turn are checked by what is kn as a review committee. however. that review committee is composed of a representative of the department of the interior. the department of agriculture. and the armed services. plus four members of the department of commerce. so obviously there is possibility of carrying out anything but the wishes of the department of commerce as translated by these representatives. i placed in the record friday certain minutes of the review committee proceedings. and it is interesting to e that the department of agriculture felt that there should be a substantial reduction in the residuals. -the department of the interior agreed. the department of the armed services did  express any opinion. at least. it was  recorded. but. when the vote was cast. they did  cut the residuals materially. . that is something you and i can explain to our constituents. we k that tankers can go by ambrose light and go up along cape cod and unload their cargoes at eastcoast ports. but the orders are "take it to the united kingdom" or "italy" or "france" or somewhere else.
