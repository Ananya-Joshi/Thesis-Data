2mf. president. the water resources development act of 1985. senate -bill s. 1567. is a well.crafked piece of legislation which rewives the federal w ter resources developmentyrogram and makes it more -efficient. major water resouroescdewelopment bill has been passed since .978. despite the need for improveiments and iew projects in many parts df the country. an average water dewelopment -project currently takes 26 years to ynuve from the :study stage to actual (construction. this biil authorizes a nuniber of .new projects. including three in rhode llsland. anti (creates new xostsharing methods for .harbor and flood control pr ojects. as well as a new userfee system .to 1help pay for hatbor and inland waterway maintenance. the projects authorized in my home state are: the big river reservoir. which will receive $39.9 million. an improvement project at gortons pond in warwick. which will receive $730.000. and the demolitionfor safety reasonsof the india point railroad bridge in providence. at a cost of $500.000. the new costsharing procedures for projects. and the user fee system created to finance a portion of federal operation and maintenance. make this a fiscally responsible bill. i support these provisions wholeheartedly. and was especially pleased to play a role in making sure we fairly applied the 0.04 percent ad valoren user fee on cargo loaded or unloaded at federal harbors. when the bill was before the committee on environment and public works. i urged adoption of a special exemption from this fee for fishermen. imposing such a tax on our fishermen would be unfair since other food source is subject to a tax at the point of harvest. the exemption includes all unprocessed fish and aquatic animals brought in to port for the first time. however. fish reloaded for transport would be subject to the fee. the committee adopted this amendment. when the finance committee on december 11 considered this same user fee. i proposed an amendment broadening the exemption for fishermen to include those who process their catch at sea before bringing it in. the processing of fish at sea is a fairly new procedure among u.s. fishermen. although foreign fishing ships have used it for years. it involved the packaging and freezing of the catch on board. so that it is ready for sale when it is unloaded. with less than 10 socalled freezertrawlers operating in the theast. and a small number in the rest of the country. this industry is still in the startup stage. four of these ships are based in davisville. ri. i believe that processed fish landed for the first time should also be exempted from the 0.04percent tax since the ability to process fish on board is an ination which is helping modernize the u.s. fishing industry in the face of foreign competition. the finance committee agreed that we should  impose a new tax on this fledgling industry. and adopted my amendment. in addition. i urged the finance committee to adopt aher amendment exempting from the user fee any ports which have received federal funds for operation and maintenance since 1977. when the army corps of engineers began keeping records on such assistance. since we have at-. tempted to adopt a genuine user fee. and  merely a tax. it seemed unfair to impose the fee on users of harbors which receive federal funds. the amendment. which the committee passed. exempts 33 ports. including providence. ri. and newport. ri. if any of these ports receive federal funds in the future. cargo passing through them would automatically. and permanently. be subject to the 0.04 percent ad valorem fee. the adoption of this exemption makes the user fee system fairer. and ensures that the users of two important rhode island ports do  have to pay for services which do  benefit them. with this bill. . we commence a new era of costefficient modernization and operation of our harbors and inland waterways. it was a pleasure to work on this bill with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on water resources. senator abd. without whose expertise we would  have such an outstanding piece of legislation. at this point. i would also like to commend senator hatfield. who worked long and hard to craft a water resources bill which was acceptable to both congress and the administration. i hope that after we pass this bill the house and senate are able to work together in conference to reach a satisfactory compromise. considering the significant differences between the two pieces of legislation. this will require small amount of work. but if they keep in mind our overall goal of putting into operation this excellent new system of financing for water project. i am sure that the conferees will act quickly and responsibly.
