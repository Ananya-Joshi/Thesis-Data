. on originally looking at this. one gets the impression that it is using federal funds for purposes other than highways. of which the federal government has paid 90 percent. then the local community or the state has changed its mind and the federal government has lost its 90 percent. however. when one takes the next step and sees that under this measure. the land which has been condemned or the construction that has taken place can only be used for very limited purposes. namely. for a transportation project or for a public conservation or public recreation purpose or such other purposes as may be determined by the secretary to be within the public interest. it does seem that it is in the best interest of the nation to do this. in other words. i do  think we ought to encourage states to plunge ahead with highway programs when. indeed. they do  want them and they are  necessary and they might have substituted mass transit. or some other form of transportation. in lieu thereof. so i think it is a good amendment. i commend the senator from new york for bringing it up. i certainly support it.
. as a member of the senate committee on environment and public works resource protection subcommittee. i view the bill i am introducing today as a vehicle which will provide the subcommittee with a new opportunity for discussion of the socalled game wildlife issue. as i am sure many of my colleagues remember. the problems which i have just outlined were addressed during the last congress and resulted in the unanimous approval by the senate of legislation on this subject. unfortunately. the house. though it was interested. was  able to approve their version of a game bill until very late in the second session. a fact which resulted in bill being finally approved during the 95th congress. the legislation introduced today builds on the experiences and kledge gained last congress and i believe this new bill will produce a more efficient and secure program than would have been possible under the previous legislation. it should also be ed that the house has already this session approved a bill concerning this matter and has expressed a desire for the senate to move rapidly toward completion of similar legislation. finally. i would like to e that i view this bill as a reasonable attempt to pass a game bill. but i am also aware that it might be improved through future hearings and subcommittee work. this being the case. i would hope that the subcommittee will use this bill as a vehicle for the discussion of the issue. i say this because there are a few issues. particularly the funding mechanism contained in the bill. that ought to be given a full airing before final subcommittee action. on this matter i intend to remain flexible but would e that i hope whatever funding approach is ultimately approved it will avoid the federal governments "stopandgo" history of funding national resource programs. we must develop a reliable source of funding that will enable the state agencies to k what they can expect over the years ahead. if the committee can accomplish this goal we will have taken the most important step in launching a national game fish and wildlife conservation program.* by mr. morgan (for himself.
i would like to briefly discuss section 11. the buy america provision of h.r. 3103. my colleagues should be aware that the committee of the environment and public works adopted this provision by a unanimous voice vote. as the committee report accompanying this bill states: the committee adopted an amendment to section 165 of the surface transportation assistance act of 1982. the "buy america" provision. the amendment restores the languages which had been agreed to by house and senate .conferees when the surface transportation assistance act of 1981 was adopted last year. the language contained in public law 97424 does  correspond with the agreement as understood by the senate conferees. as i discussed this point on december 23. 1982. and my colleagues senators stafford. randolph. domenici. and moynihan agreed: the one change that was agreed to was to increase. for highway projects only from 10 to 25 percent. the price differential needed before foreign materials. rather than american. could be used on a project. all other provisions of existing law. including the administrative interpretations consistent with current law. were to remain undisturbed. accordingly. it is my understanding that. except for this one change. the department of transportations regulatory program implementing title iv of the surface transportation assistance act of 1978. public law 95599 would remain unchanged. do my colleagues agree.

. for the past 7 years. congress has been struggling with the need to amend the clean air act. during that time. we have successfully rewritten and strengthened the clean water act. the federal hazardous waste control law ercrai. the superfund hazardous waste cleanup law. and the safe drinking water act. it is  time to break the clean air act logjam. what began as a debate about acid rain is  a debate about that and much more. longer are we just talking about a few dead lakes and streams in the theast. we are talking about the health and welfare of every man. woman. and child in america. despite the remarkable improvements in air quality that have been achieved in the last 10 to 20 years. we can afford to rest on our laurels. even today. air pollution can make our eyes sting and our throats burn. it can damage the fragile lungs of our children. those with special problems. the elderly and asthmatics are even more sensitive to air pollution. it can kill trees and. in the form of acid rain. it can kill fish and cause dangerous metals such as lead and mercury to leach out of the ground into the water we drink. we still see trucks and buses spewing black smoke on the highways and city streets. equally dangerous but invisible are the toxic air pollutants that are being emitted all across the country. furthermore. we are all contributing to the ozone problems. on the one hand. we use and release a class of chemicals kn as cfcschlorofluorocarbonsthat. are destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere where it shields us from the suns harmful ultraviolet radiation. on the other hand. by driving our cars and painting our buildings we are creating ozone or smog in the lower atmosphere where it is a health hazard. the clean air act was last amended in 1977. since that time. we have discovered more and more evidence of problems that are caused by air pollution. fortunately. we have also discovered ways to control the pollution. techogy has come a long way in the last 10 years.  it is time to use that kledge and techogy to clean up the air we breath. reauthorization of the clean air act is the environment committees top priority this year. we have already introduced bills on acid rain and ozone depletion and have held numerous heaings on a wide range of issues. today. several of us are introducing a bill to address the ozone attainment problem. the smog problem. we will move quickly to more hearings and hope to have a bill ready for debate and a vote in the senate by september of this year. some people will look at this bill and see a deadline extension. aher way to look at itthe more accurate descriptionis a bill to bring cities into compliance with clean air standards for ozone and carbon moide. we have a problem. the current law requires cities to be in compliance with existing health based standards by december 31 of this year. for a whole series of reasonssome that were avoidable. some approximately 50 areas can meet that deadline. if we do hing. those areas will be subject to sanctions. including bans on new construction and cutoffs of federal funds for highways and sewage plants. for some areas. sanctions would be unfair. included in this category is my own state of rhode island. like many areas in the theast. part of the problem in rhode island is the transport of pollution from upwind areas such as new york. the current law doesnt deal with this problem very well. it uses a statebystate approach. the bill we are introducing today will fix that by establishing regions and a program for regional control of air pollution. but one gets a simple deadline extension under this bill. there are conditions. even areas subject to the transport problem must do more to control local pollution. some of these areas. like boston and providence. ri. are eligible for a 5year extension. for areas with more severe pollution. like los angeles and new york city. there is a 10year extension of the deadline in exchange for a commitment to implement a whole series of additional control measures. included in this bill are new. tighter federal standards and pollution control requirements for cars and trucks. including diesel trucks. these will improve air quality everywhere. the regional differences that have blocked action on the clean air act. in the past. particularly on acid rain problems. are still there and we have a tough road to hoe. but i for one am committed to amending and improving the act. clean air is  just a idealistic dream. it is a realistic goal that is within our grasp. together. we will defeat our opponents and help every man. woman. and child breath a little easier. by mr. helms:
. today i am introducing a bill entitled the "oilspill prevention and response improvement act. as its name suggests. the bill has two purposes. first. it will help to prevent oilspills. second. it will improve the response to the environmental and ecoic injuries from oilspills that do occur. it does this by increasing access to funds and by providing measures to make sure that both types of injuries are redressed. before getting into the substance of the bill in more detail. let me describe briefly how it came to be. generally speaking. the bill is a response to lessons learned from a number of recent oilspills that have spurred requests for oil pollution reforms. of these spills. the one of most interest to me occurred a little over 3 months ago when a barge. the th cape. ran aground just off of the coast of my state of rhode island. despite valiant efforts by the coast guard and others. the grounding resulted in the largest oilspill in rhode islands history. by the time the leak was contained. nearly 800.000 gallons of oil had poured into our coastal waters. of course. much of the spilled oil ended up on our beaches. along with the carcasses of many fish. birds. and thousands of lobsters. as chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over oil pollutionenvironment and public worksi convened the committee twice to examine federal oil pollution legislation in light of the th cape incident and the other recent oilspills. the first time was for a field hearing that took place in narragansett. ri. it examined the nations oilspill pollution laws in the context of how they operated during the th cape spill. the principal law we evaluated was the oil pollution act. better kn as opa. which was enacted in 1990. after the infamous exxon valdez spill. the second hearing in washington. dc. took a broader approach. it looked at the issues raised during the rhode island hearing and assessed the possibility of improving opa to prevent and better respond to oilspills. in these hearings we learned that. overall. opa is working pretty well. in comparing a similar oil spill that occurred in rhode island waters in 1989. the world prodigy spill. with this years th cape spill. the hard work of rhode islanders was evident in both cases. however. such efforts clearly met with better results in the th cape spill. the difference was opa. the clear consensus of all witnesses who testified before the environment and public works committee is that opa is a valuable piece of legislation. it has produced faster and more effective spill responses throughout the last 6 years. nevertheless. there is room for improvement. on the prevention side. for. example. several witnesses suggested how opa can be strengthened so that we can avoid having to respond to an oilspill at all. the general consensus was that equipping oilcarrying tank vessels with double hulls is far and away the best way to prevent oilspills. the other set of issues that emerged related to response. for example. agencies have struggled to coordinate and agree on how to proceed with decisions related to the reopening of closed fishing grounds. lobstermen and fishermen have found it difficult.to secure shortterm financial assistance under the act. finally. questions have been raised about the availability of the $1 billion oilspill liability trust fund to pay for the toll on fish and wildlife injured by a spill. the issues raised during our hearings set the stage for the bill introduced today. let me  explain how the bill addresses these issues and how it improves prevention and response to oilspills. first. the bill reduces the likelihood that oilspills will occur in the future. it does so through the use of both carrots. or incentives. and sticks. or regulations. on the incentive side. the bill recognizes the key role of double hulls in spill prevention. indeed. this is why opa mandates that all major vessels be doublehulled later than the year 2015. but the bill also recognizes that converting the nations oilcarrying fleet will be costly. the bill gets around financial concerns by providing an inducement to those operators who take the initiative and convert to double hulls before the mandate kicks it. currently. there is a cap in opa establishing a ceiling on the amount of liability for a vessel that spills oil. however. there are a host of exceptions to that limit. which has led some oil shippers to assert that the liability cap is meaningless. this bill greatly reduces the chances that an oil carrier who converts to a doublehull vessel will have to pay more than the liability cap established in opa. it does this.by limiting the conditions under which the cap can be exceeded for such an operator to those in which the operator has been grossly negligent or has engaged in willful misconduct. the bill directs the coast guard to issue operational rules within the next 3 months and structural rules within the next 8 months for singlehulled tankers and barges. it also requires final rules to be issued for the tug boats that tow such barges. the purpose of these rules is to enhance protection of the marine environment by reducing the likelihood of an oilspill. opa as originally enacted required the coast guard to issue the rules for tankers and barges nearly 5 years ago. this bill says: egh is egh when it comes to delay. if the coast guard does  get out the rules when it says it will. interim prevention measures such as requiring a vessel to have an operable anchor and man on board. or an emergency barge retrieval system. will automatically go into effect. in addition. minimum underkeel clearances also will be required. on the response side. the bill will reduce the ecoic hardship and environmental damage caused by a spill. to limit financial injury. for example. it requires that advance procedures are developed for the reopening of affected fishing grounds. these procedures will make sure that such reopening occurs as quickly as possible consistent with public health and safety. advanced planning also will ensure that bureaucratic infighting does  hold up reopening. to mitigate environmental harm. the bill provides greater access to the oilspill liability trust fund. to information. and to scientific expertise. this will allow response personnel to better minimize harm to the marine environment in the aftermath of a spill. finally. the bill will help make financial assistance available right away for those whose livelihoods are affected by a spill. it achieves this purpose in two ways. first. it makes clear that a person injured by a spill may receive a partial settlement in the short term without waiving the right to full compensation. injured parties will longer have to wait before pursuing a claim while their rent and grocery bills pile up. second. the bill allows major oilspills to be declared major disasters and thus. to qualify for federal major disaster relief. such relief carries with it the availability of immediate funding. overall then. the oilspill prevention and response improvement act builds on the successes of opa. yet it addresses the lessons learned from opas shortcomings. while the bill puts -tougher prevention measures in place. it also gives operators the necessary incentives to take such measures. and in the event an oilspill does occur. it creates a response scheme that truly addresses ecoic and environmental losses. the bill also reflects an attempt to respond to calls to reform the nations oil pollution laws in an expeditious and effective. yet deliberate and precise. way. i am confident that the bill is broad egh to bring about meaningful reform yet narrow egh to enlist the support necessary to become law. in closing. i would like to thank the two primary cosponsors of the bill. senator lieberman of connecticut and senator lautenberg of new jersey. both of these colleagues of mine on the environment and public works committee have worked diligently with me to make it a better product.
. i rise today as a cosponsor of the intermodal transportation act of 1997. a comprehensive. 6year measure to reauthorize the nations federal aidhighway. highway safety. and other surface transportation programs. i am particularly pleased to be doing so with 10 of my colleagues from the environment and public works committee. senator warner and senator baucus. senators
. i want to say how much i appreciate the wonderful work on this legislation by senator bond. senator warner. senator baucus. and others. i am pleased to joint them in cosponsoring the surface transportation extension act of 1997. seven weeks ago. the committee on environment and public works unanimously reported out s. 1173. better kn as istea ii. i am proud of the committees efforts to come to an agreement on a very difficult piece of legislation. we filed the report at the end of september. and we were prepared to complete action on the bill before the end of the calendar year. regrettably. a number of unrelated events having hing to do with istea have prevented us from completing work this year on a 6year reauthorization bill. as the prospects have dimmed for the enactment of a 6year bill this year. it is clear that we can go home before taking care of a -number of concerns. this past tuesday. ember 4. the committee on environment and public works subcommittee on transportation and infrastructure held a hearing on which many of these concerns were brought to light. first of all. if congress does hing. a number of states will be hardpressed to survive through the spring on their existing uligated balances. second. states are restricted in using their uligated balances across federalaid highway. transit. and safety categories. third. a number of federal transportation safety programs. as well as the federal transit program. have funds to carry over into this fiscal year. finally. without any relief. the federal highway administration will be forced to shut down in january. which could result in 3.600 employees being furloughed. despite the gloomy reports of what could. happen if congress fails to act. there is a solution. senators bond. warner. baucus. and i have a measure that addresses the needs of the states. the safety programs. the federalaid highway program. and transit. first of all. the bill before us will keep the nations transportation system up and running until we enact the longterm reauthorization bill. it gives states the flexibility they need to continue transportation planning and construction activities. each state is guaranteed at least 50 percent of the previous years spending limitation to spend on any transportation project or program. to keep the states on equal footing. however. state may spend more than 75 percent of its 1997 spending limitation. second. the bill provides states with flexibility to spend their uligated balances on any highway. safety. or transit program category. to prevent important environmental programs such as the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program [cmaq] from being unfairly disadvantaged. however. the secretary of transportation would restore the transferred funds back to these programs when the new reauthorization bill is enacted. third. the bill provides funding for key istea safety and transit programs. the motor carrier safety assistance program. the state and community safety grant program. the national driver register. operation lifesaver. and the alcoholimpaired driving countermeasures program. will continue to run. also. the federal transit discretionary and formula programs will receive the funds they need. fourth. the bill provides funds for the federal highway administration to continue operating and assisting the states with their transportation programs. before closing. let me comment on. what the bill before us does  do. unlike the 6month extension bill that was approved by the house earlier this month. this bill does  provide states with contract authority for 1 years worth of highway construction. our bill gives the states until may 1 of next year to obligate the funds provided in this bill. the trouble with including funds that will  run out until next ember is that there will be pressure to enact permanent istea legislation until that time. right before the 1998 elections. pushing the decision off until next fall runs the risk of our being without a bill 1 year from . moreover. this measure avoids the contentious fight we would have over apportionment formulas and funding categories if we were to take up the house bill. the bill before us is by means perfect. but it is the optimal approach to the situation. our hopes for an ideal outcome were dashed when we were unable to complete work on a 6year reauthorization bill. this measure keeps the state and federal transportation programs running. it ensures that highway contractors are put out of work. and it continues funding for vital safety and transit programs. most important. it will keep the momentum going to enact a 6year bill early next year. and it does all of this without a battle over the formulas.. again. i want to commend senator bond for his determination in moving this measure forward. i also want to thank senators warner and baucus for their excellent work. i urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this important measure.
. yesterday. the committee on environment and public works held an important meeting on the pending business before the senate. namely. the underlying legislation. s. 1173. the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1997. during yesterdays business meeting. the committee agreed unanimously. the 18 members of the committee voted 180. to adopt an amendment to s. 1173. which will provide an additional $25.9 billion for the nations highway programs over the next 5 years. the additional funds will bring the total authorization for highways in the bill to $171 billion. as i mentioned last thursday in my opening statement on istea i1. which is how we will refer to the underlying legislation. the majority leader. senator lott. and. senators domenici.
i say to the senator from colorado that we are happy to pledge to him that we will strive in our work during the conference with the house to address the issue the senator has raised. the house bill includes the provision he would have offered. so the issue will be in conference. the pm factor will be considered. the senator from colorado has raised a very good point. in some western cities transportation emissions are a principal source of fine particulates in the air. epa has recently issued new standards for particulate matter that may require these cities to adopt transportation strategies to reach attainment. the cmaq program in this highway bill is intended to help cities solve their transportationrelated air quality problems. so i am happy to pledge to the senator from colorado that we will strive in our work during the conference with the house to address the issue he has raised. the house bill includes the provision he would have offered. so the issue will be in the conference and the pm factor could be included in the final formula for cmaq funding. i want to stress though that we should only move in that direction where the particulate pollution problem is caused by transportation as opposed to stationary sources such as power plants.

seven years ago. we passed the first comprehensive national laws to insure a cleaner environment. the clean air act. since the time we passed that landmark legislation. we have relaxed its provisions twice. in 1974. we amended the act to extend interim standards for 1 year and we gave the administrator of the environmental protection agencyepathe authority to extend them for aher year. nearly i year later. he exercised that authority. . we are faced once again with the opportunity to turn back the timetable and retreat from our earlier commitment to clean air. we have the choice to either insist upon stringent automobile emission standards or to allow such pollutants as nitrogen oxide to continue to be emitted at their present levels and run the risk of increasing health problems. i. for one. have decided to support a strong compliance schedule for meeting auto emission standards and a strong consumer protection provision for new car buyers. i must tell you. quite honestly. that this has  been an easy decision for me. while i am committed to the fight to clean up our environment. i did  brush aside the arguments concerning the effects of these provisions upon jobs. i have had a considerable amount of time to study the facts and figures regarding the impact of tough auto emission standards upon employment. as my colleagues will remember. we considered these same alternatives for clean air last year. at that time. and since then. i have continued to study the issue. concerned members of the automotive aftermarket industry have been worried that a five year or 50.000 mile performance warranty for auto emission control devices would be anticompetitive and a boondoggle for the manufacturers. many of the smaller auto repair shops and fullservice gasoline stations in my state of massachusetts are run by independent businessmen. during my tenure in the senate. i have sought to assure them of more job security. for example. my decision to cosponsor legislation making it harder for major oil companies to terminate leases for these independent businessmen was based on that commitment. i do  want to jeopardize their future success in any way. i believe the provisions in the bill preserve their job security. these provisions: first. prohibit an auto manufacturer from conditioning the emission performance of a vehicle on the use of any component or service specified by brand. trade or corporate name unless the auto manufacturer satisfies the administrator that the component or service must be used for the proper functioning of the vehicle. second. prohibit the manufacturer from including any service or component use conditions in any written maintenance instructions furnished with the vehicle. third. require the manufacturer to bear the replacement cost of any part principally used for emission control which is scheduled for replacement during the useful life of the vehicle and whose cost is greater than 2 percent of the vehicles retail cost. and fourth. require the federal trade commissionftcto study the potential impact on competition of any warranty requirement for 1 year. fifth. establish a program for standardizing aftermarket parts. i am convinced that a 5year performance warranty would  be anticompetitive and drive away customers from smaller auto shops to larger service centers run by the auto manufacturers. according to a provision in the amendments. manufacturers can specify components or service by brand. trade or corporate name. i believe that the provision can successfully cut. in the consumers mind. the band which would tie warranty work or maintenance work to car dealers. by establishing the program for standardizing aftermarket parts and by mandating the ftc study of anticompetitive effects. consumers will  hesitate to continue having their cars serviced by small independent service stations. as time goes on and consumers get accustomed to having their emission control devices inspected and repaired. i feel repair work on these devices will become as common as having a muffler installed or a headlight replaced. the average driver will be more concerned about having his or her work done by a competent mechanic than he or she will about having the work completed by an auto dealer. a strong performance warranty also benefits the consumer. since a consumer is paying for an emission device which should reduce pollutants for the life of the car. he or she is entitled to get his or her moneys worth. to me. buying a car with a pollution device which may stop functioning after 18 months is like buying a refrigerator with a defective freezer. we must guard against any measure which would take advantage of the consumer. aher major issue which we are confronting concerns automobile emission standards. there have been many studies on the impact of emission standards on employment in the auto industry. and. unfortunately. they are difficult to compare. some consider both emission standards and fuel efficiency. others simply use formulas which are  analogous. for example. one study stresses the number of new jobs it would create while aher study stresses the number of jobs it would eliminate in comparison to the number of industry jobs predicted for the future. however. the emission control system changes have added more than 10 percent to the yearly increase in car sticker prices during the past 8 years. thus. i believe we can predict with a high degree of certainty that it is the ecoy and  this techogy which will affect new sales in the future. and. we k that. regardless of which alternative strategy we follow to reduce the level of carbon moide. hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide in our air. we will have a net increase in jobs. the question is  how many jobs will be lost but. rather. how many jobs will be created. and the new jobs will be created for people in the emission control industry as well. i would  support any timetable for emission standards which i felt would severely disrupt the prospects of new jobs. and i do  believe that these amendments do so. first of all. i believe that the automobile industry has available techogy to avoid any major production disturbances even if it were necessary to reduce the level of nitrogen oxide to 1 by 1980. it is secret that auto manufacturers were able to supply the necessary equipment to meet stringent emission standards in california after they were forced to do it. and. the new regulation has  shaken the industry even though california has over 14 million registered motor vehiclesnearly five times the number of vehicles in my own state of massachusetts. volvos threeway catalyst has demonstrated the ability of one auto manufacturer to meet strong emission standards. the threeway catalyst. which is being adopted by a number of american cars. uses a platinumrhodium mechanism to render all three major automotive pollutants harmless. general motors and the ford motor co. have begun experimenting with sensor equipped catalysts already. furthermore. fuel efficiency will  be eacrificed by the use of this new techogy. the most inefficient techogy is the existing catalytic converter which would be retzaned if the amendments are weakened. according to a national academy of sciences study. a threeway catalyst would exact only a 2percent fuel penalty at an increased 10year lifetime cost of $266. and. according to a department of transportationenvironmental protection agency study. we could achieve a 40percent improvement in fuel ecoy by combining new techogies with engine resizing and a shift to smaller cars. the combination of these factors would also cause a substantial reduction in the amount of carbon moide and hydrocarbons emitted by cars. but still leaves the issue of nitrogen oxide unresolved. these reductions are imperative if we do  want to imperil the health of all americans. today. auto emissions account for 72 percent of the carbon moide. 41 percent of unburned hydrocarbons. and 35 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the nations air. and. according to the federal panel on air quality. se and health. strong emission standards would result in over 11 million fewer additional attacks of lower respiratory disease in children then the less stringent timetable considered by the senate. we must insist upon new techogy to reduce the risks to human health. i igree that the cost of maintaining antipollution devices may be high. but it is  so high as the price we would pay if we fail to employ such devices.
our government has never hesitated to intervene in ecoic matters when there was a need which private enterprise could  meet. i see reason why it should hesitate to do so in this instance and i say to my good conservation friends. as i have said heretofore. that if responsible leaders do  let the government meet the essential needs of the people. then the people will turn to leadership which will take them down the road to socialism and worse. and in very short order.
i thank my colleague. twice within the last 6 months the senate has voted to end all federal -financing of the supersonic transport project. the house of representatives. by a small margin.  has reversed its previous opposition to the project and a third senate vote on the sst is necessary. the senate should vote once again to terminate federal funding of the sst. hing has occurred between the last senate vote on the sst. on march 24. and today to prompt the senate to change its mind on the project. in the last 2 months i believe that opposition to the project on the part of the public at large has increased steadily. the federal funds that would be spent on developing two prototype airplanes can be more profitably used for urgent national needs. of which there are many. the environmental case against the sst has  been refuted. the plane will generate sonic booms which will be an intolerable anance to those hearing them. the booms may even cause physical damage. the sst engines. as presently designed. will cause intolerable sideline se. exhaust from the engines may irreparably pollute the stratosphere with potentially dangerous consequences for life on earth. i do  rest the case on this by any means. because it was  stated before. when we voted on it the last time. but recent scientific statements on the atmospheric effects have been even more devastating. it seems to me. than those which we had in our possession before. certainly. without more kledge than we have in this area. we dare  take a chance. the information that we do have. the authority of the men and women who express concerns in the area of the environment. seems to me to put us on ice that to proceed at this time without thorough examination and study of the matter would be irresponsible to the point of recklessness. building the two prototypes is  necessary to get this information and will  be helpful in this regard. it would  be helpful in getting answers on the most important question. and that is on the question of the destruction of the atmosphere. the questions concerning the effect of many. many sst flights on the ozone layer. our kledge on all of this would be advanced  one whit by building two prototypes. we can find the answers to those questions. it may take a long time to find them. but we will  find them by building two prototypes. so there is point in building the prototypes on the excuse that we need them in order to answer the environmental questions. the ecoic case against the sst stems in partonly in partfrom the environmental case. it is generally agreed that dealing with sonic boom and engine se will reduce the ecoic viability of the plane. i take some little pride in the fact that i was the first one to introduce legislation to prohibit overland sst flights that would cause sonic booms. dealing with engine se. in other words. installing suppressors and what. as well as banning overland flights. will inevitably reduce the ecoic viability of the plane. that viability is a very fragile thing. if it exists at all. apart from the further strains on it that will result inevitably from any attempts to deal in any rational way with the problem of sonic boom and the problem of sideline se. the great weight of ecoic opinion is against the sst. ecoists from opposite ends of the spectrum. such as paul samuelson and milton friedman. oppose the project. they raise the simple question: if the sst will be as profitable as its proponents claim. why  let private enterprise take over the venture. i do  think there is any answer to that. certainly. there is answer that satisfies me that has been suggested on this floor or in the forum of public opinion at any other place. if it is going to be profitable. well. let private enterprise make that judgment. take the risks. and make whatever profit will be involved. we have seen what private enterprise thinks of it. they do  want any part of it. the reason. of course. is clear. this project is  even murky any more. it is clearly banned as an ecoic proposition. since congress voted 2 months ago to kill the project. private financing has  been forthcoming. so the doubts only the doubts. but the certaintyabout the ecoic soundness of the sst have permeated and penetrated the private sector itself. the ecoic soundness of the whole project has been called into further question by recent news reports quoting the chairman of the boeing co.. prime contractor for the sst airframe. as saying that the costs of restarting the project may add between $500 million to $1 billion to the total price which has been given to us most recently as the estimated cost of developing the prototypes. the same boeing official. according to the press accounts. also confirmed what many of us have feared for some timethat the airplane production industry is really relying on federal financial assistance  only for the building of the prototypes. but also to carry on the expensive production phase. if that is what they are relying on. i think it is a very good indication that this is the time to call an end to the matter. of course. there should  be any surprise about this. those of us who have been concerned about the sst on any ground. including the ecoic ground. have felt with increasing confidence that we were rightthat it was unrealistic to expect that boeing or any other company would be willing to finance. on its own. the production of airplanes it was going to sell for $50 million or more each. so i shall vote again to terminate federal funding of the sst project. i hope very much that the senate will stand by the position that it took so wisely just a few weeks ago. i am confident that if the senate does so. the house of representatives. which recently voted by a very small margin to use the proposed termination moneys for continuation of the prototype project. will support the senates action. i think the house should. i think it would be a wise action. we will  regret that we have. perhaps too late but nevertheless on sound ground. taken a real step forward on the whole matter of the relations between government and industry in the advancement of our techogy. . i suggest the absence of a quorum.
. as we consider an amendment to the transportation appropriations bill we once again engage in makingand i hope reaffirma basic policy decision about supersonic transports. the ssts. three times within a 6month period in 1971 the senate voted against the sst. the issue was the use of federal funds for the development of two experimental supersonic transports. but the decision was  taken simply on the question of proper use of federal funds. i said in 1971and i believe it is even more true todaythat the majority of the people of the country are against the sst. the underlying factors in this opposition are environmental. as the friends of the earth said of the concorde: it is . . . a waster of fuel. a threat to the ozone layer and the public health. earlier this year i was dismayed to learn that the federal aviation administration was seriously considering allowing french and british airlines to fly supersonic transports into dulles international airport in washington and john f. kennedy airport in new york. to me. allowing british and french concordes to land at kennedy and dulles would be the beginning of a reversal of the public policy which the congress determined in 1971. numerous publications reflecting scientific evaluations of the potential threat to the total environment have  allayed my earlier fears. thepotential is there for serious ozone depletion with its consequence for health. for the climate and for agricultureindeed for the world as we k it. the amendment which i cosponso with senators bayh and proxmire would prohibit the use of federal aviation administration funds to handle landing oi the french and british supersonic transports unless these aircraft can meel se standards for subsonic jets. of course. we can tell ahei country what it can do in areas  under u.s. control. but we should  encourage foreign flights by permittint supersonic planes to land at any u.s airport. and we can and should say to the federal aviation administration. "do encourage these flights because this i. a violation of basic u.s. policy." i urge the senate to reaffirm our earlier decision.
. the republican citizens committees critical issues council today asked that the deadline of putting a man on the moon by 1970 be dropped to permit "the achievement of a sounder program for manned lunar exploration at annual expenditure rates lower than those  committed or proposed." the council. which is headed by dr. milton s. eisenhower. said in a paper examining americas military and civilian space program: the manned lunar landing program represents a challenge. to be sure. but we do  believe that the hopedfor psychological or propaganda advantages call for the present efforts to meet a publicized deadline. currently stated as prior to 1970. we find reason to believe that putting a man on the moon could contribute to our military strength. we see evidence that urgent defense objectives warrant a crash program or that a meeting of deadlines such as 1970 serves any significant national objective. as for the military space effort. the council asserted: we are aware of compelling argument thus far for the development and deploying of weapons in space. today and in the foreseeable future there seems to be military need for putting nuclear weapons in orbit. the republican policy group said: the exploration of our universe is a goal too vast. too hazardous. too costly. and too important to all mankind to be financed and conducted by one country alone. and least of all in an atmosphere of unfriendly competition. under present world conditions. the council said it strongly supports continuing military space activities. including the development of manned orbiting laboratories. but with respect to the civilian space effort. the council stated: we would urge a reexamination of objectives and of the pace at which various elements of this program are carried forward. the prestige the united states has acquired among nations by its space research "has a considerably higher value than we have apparently realized." the paper said. but there is a risk of losing "our present leadership in scientific discovery and kledge" unless further space research is given the "highest priority." the council declared: the present lunar program is  regarded as primarily scientific in its objective. admittedly. a project of considerable human interest. it is chiefly a prestige item. intended to win the mantomoon race. indeed. if this race is  won. or if a premature attempt involves a loss of life. its prestige value largely vanishes. this fact. coupled with the setting of a deadline date. necessarily gives the lunar landing project the character of a crash program. this is increasingly true when the schedule slips. as is bound to happen in an undertaking of this elty and complexity. crash programs are oriously expensive. wasteful. and prone to premature execution. in calling for a replanning of the present civilian program "to provide for a more orderly. yet aggressively pursued. stepbystep program." the council suggested the following five steps: first. continued development of launch vehicle systems necessary to meet the revised program objectives. second. detailed instrumented exploration of the lunar surface. third. sufficient study of the space and lunar environment to permit manned flights to the vicinity of the moon and ultimately to the surface of the moon with confidence in their safety. fourth. collaboration in civilian and military programs to launch manned orbiting laboratories. fifth. further negotiation with other nations for cooperative space exploration. the council believes that new techniques and processes expected from the lunar program "have been much exaggerated." a more orderly program should produce "as much and probably more in the way of byproducts" than a crash effort. the council said: finally. we stress the need to count the cost in manpower when making decisions about great space programs which require thousands of skilled personnel. especially scientists. engineers. and technicians. all in short supply. by attracting too much of our best inating talent into one field * * * we are likely to rob other areas of * * * the highlevel talent they need. i ask unanimous consent that the full text of the councils report be printed in the record.
. my state. as do others with large metropolitan areas. desperately needs the assistance provided for in this bill. although some may be content to wait. new york can.  only does new york city need assistance. but the other cities of new york just as clearly must receive federal assistance if their mass transportation operations are to survive. buffalo. rochester. syracuse. and albany have mass transit systems that will lose riders and that will have to raise fares if assistance is forthcoming. moreover. these cities can possibly afford. even with substantial help from the state. to make improvements to and expansions of their existing systems. as the mass transit alternative becomes less appealing. the only choice left for our urban residents is the private automobile. this can only lead to prolongation if  worsening of the gasoline shortages experienced last winter. with continued dependence upon imported oil for greater and greater percentages of our fuel requirements. the consequences for our cities air is equally bleak if efforts are  begun  to turn urban americans away from their cars and into mass transit. even with the emission control equipment presently on all new automobiles. and planned for future cars. the growth in vehicle miles is so great that the air quality in our cities has steadily worsened. transportation control plans. which are the key element in implementation of federal air quality standards. are merely pies in the sky if mass transit does  improve and expand. the importance of this bill. to both of these urgent goals. can be overestimated. i commend senator williams for his able and continuing leadership on this crucial issue. i hope that the members of the committee on banking. housing and urban affairs will again demonstrate their concern by acting on this measure at the earliest practical time. i trust that when brought to the senate floor. my colleagues will support this measure as they have supported mass transit legislation in the past. time is of the essence. and i urge my fellow senators to rally behind this bill so that it can begin the long process of mass transit improvement this year.
