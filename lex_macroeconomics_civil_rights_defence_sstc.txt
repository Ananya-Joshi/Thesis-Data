. i oppose h.r. 13018. the military construction authorization bill for fiscal year first of all. i believe that we must cut funds from the militaryindustrial complex. if indeed we ever wish to meet our drastic needs here at home. second. i strongly believe that we should  be voting for any funds for the abm at this time. on the eve of strategic arms limitation talks with the soviets. the authorization in this bill for the installation of an abm communications system in colorado could easily make more difficult talks with the soviets. and would be inconsistent with article vi of the nuclear proliferation treaty. which indicates our desire to pursue negotiations "in good faith." finally. i oppose section 708 of the bill. which constitutes a broad and absolute ban on demonstrations either in the pentagon or on surrounding federally owned properties. in my judgment. this is a blatant infringement on individual rights of free speech and assembly. contrary to the first amendment.
