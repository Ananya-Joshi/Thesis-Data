 has affirmed his commitment to help survive. these young men will  be intimidated. they expect to abide for a purpose and to be hoed in a morality and expect to continue doing as they tried to do in germany. their sacrifice and their deaths are meaningful. the majority and miity leaders have put their fingers on the real issues here. what appalls the world is that any nation can give sanctuary to these terrorists. that they can issue press statements. and maintain sources of raising revenue and have the approval even of prime ministers for their acts of barbarism which should cut them off from any civilized contact with all nations of the world. we are the leader of the free world. the soviet union is the leader of the communist world. there must be clearer duty for us than to lead with all our strength. all our influence. and all of our prestige if we are to preserve mankind and cut off from the rest of mankind any nation which. as the resolution .so eloquently states. "gives sanctuary. support. sympathy. aid. or comfort to acts of murder and barbarism such as those just witnessed at munich." this refers to acts of any kind or character committed by an enemy of all mankind.  just the arabs. this is the most complete act of anarchy we have witnessed in our history. we simply have to address it. we have the means. they can survive if they have place to go. but they do have places to go to receive sympathy. aid. equipment. and training. our assembled view that we desire to stop such acts in the future by our power and strength in the world. if implemented. will go a long way toward stopping them. this is a matter of morality. and i hope that this is the purpose which we will serve.
