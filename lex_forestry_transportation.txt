. until  corporations. government agencies. and roadbuilders have shown shocking disregard for our scenery. wildlife. natural resources. and historic communities and landmarks. once a forest or preserve is destroyed or desecrated by a highway it is ruined forever. . i urge the adoption of my amendment in order to save from destruction what remains of our invaluable natural and historical resources. for only if we give local conservationists a voice and a veto over the roadbuilders may we save our environment.
