. recent press reports have provided a slim ray of hope for those of usand they are manywho remain deeply concerned about the fate of the two israeli citizens still held captive by the government of syria. i refer to the fact that 10 nations have  called the u.n. general assembly to inscribe upon its agenda a resolution calling for "effective measures" against international air piracy. it is mi matter when more than 50 incidents of air piracy occur in a single year. the world has become more closely bound together than ever before. international trade and tourism depend upon the reliable transfer of goods and people among the several nations of the world. thousands of flights. millions of people. and billions of dollars in goods are involved in this international traffic each year. nearly every nation has at least one airline. some privately and some publicly operated. upon which it depends in great measure. and every nation which has such an airline must rely on the good will of other states for the safe operation of its planes and the safe conduct of its passengers and crew. nations welfare is served. therefore. when one state chooses to harbor international criminals and to keep their victims imprisoned. for if one country can so violate the codes of decency in international relations and escape retribution. then we may be verging on a state of anarchy in international affairs unparalleled since the days when the elizabethan "seadogs" plundered the trade of friend and foe alike. i shall have more to say on this subject in the near future. for the entire issue of air piracy is of deep and growing concern to me. however. i do wish to take this opportunity to welcome the proposal of the 10 member states and to express my hope once again that the government of syria will realize the danger of the course upon which it has embarked and will take immediate steps to release the two remaining passengers and deal justly with their abductors.
