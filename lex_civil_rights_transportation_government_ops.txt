as the senate considers the conference report for the transportation efficiency act for the 21st century. i want to take a moment to discuss the disadvantaged business enterprise (dbe) program that is part of this bill. the dbe program was designed to ensure that all americans have the opportunity to compete for the many billions of dollars in contracts that will flow from this legislation. the program. which has been in place since 1982. has proven both necessary to and effective in our efforts to remedy discrimination in transportation procurement markets. by reauthorizing the dbe program again this year. congress has signaled its belief that the evidence remains clear: we need this program if we are to remove the continuing barriers confronted by miityand womened businesses. .let me take a moment to share with my colleagues additional information that has come to light since the two chambers last considered the dbe program. a disparity study conducted for the colorado department of transportation (cdot) and released in april found that there was a disproportionately small number of women- and miityowned contractors participating in colorados transportation construction industry. the study showed that africanamericans received e of the statefunded highway construction contracts over $500.000. hispanic firms received less than onehalf of one percent (.26%). and womened businesses were awarded less than onequarter of one percent (.18%). the vast majority of contractsmore than 99 percentwent to firms owned by white men. the authors found that a significant disparity existed between what miity contractors actually received and what they might be expected to receive in the absence of discrimination. the colorado study also demonstrated that the dbe program has worked in leveling the playing field for women- and miityowned firms. it es that "only when a dbe program has been in effect. has there been any significant dollar amounts utilized with [miity-/womened] firms." the fact of the matter is that discrimination continues to plague miity- and womened firms in america. -congress has a strong and compelling interest in remedying this situation. and in the dbe program. we have had and will continue to have an effective tool.
