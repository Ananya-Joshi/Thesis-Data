. i have seen this project. i do  k how many of these people have seen it. i have seen it. senator moynihan has seen it. it is a travesty. we are going to move more earth in building this dam than we movedin building the panama canal. this is a $3 billion project. and it is growing. it seems to me that when we are cutting school lunches. social welfare. and food stamps. this project should be cut. too.
. the fire prevention and control act is. 21801 will come to the floor in a. few days. i am pleased to join with senator gorton as a cosponsor of an amendment [ 1793] to the reauthorization to begin daylight savings time the first sunday in april. under current law. daylight savings time does  begin until the last sunday in april. as a result. april mornings are brightened by the earliest sunrises of the year. the effect of the amendment would be to transfer an hour of daylight from the early morning to the early evening for 3 weeks in april. during these 3 weeks the sun would rise and set about the same time it does  in midaugust and early september. in 1974 and 1975 congress temporarily extended daylight savings time for 6 months to 8 months of the year to conserve energy. the u.s. department of transportation found that extended daylight savings time saved 100.000 barrels of oil per day by reducing electricity consumption. discouraged violent crime. and reduced traffic fatalities in april by 1.5 percent. public opinion polls consistently show that by more than 2 to 1. americans favor an extension of daylight savings time. and why . it would give us an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day for safer commuting. for play time for children. for shopping. and for leisure time with our families. for those 400.000 americans who suffer from retinitis pigmentosis. or night blindness. the extra evening hour of daylight is especially significant. an extension would also lead to important ecoic benefits. more than 8.300 companies from a wide variety of industries (e.g. sporting goods and barbecue manufacturers. travel. convenience stores) have joined forces as the daylight savings time coalition. the coalition estimates that an extension could generate billions of dollars in additional revenues and result in the creation of thousands of new jobs. the house of representatives has already passed a bill to extend day.light savings time from the first sunday in april to the first sunday in ember. we have  included the ember extension because those r who live on the western edge of a time zone are concerned that their children would then have to leave for school in the dark. this is a legitimate concern and we have tried to take it into account by limiting the extension to april. under this amendment. average sunrises in these areas during the first week in april would occur at 7:15 a.m.. later than those that  occur in september under the existing daylight savings time system. benjamin franklin once wrote. "does thou love life. then do  squander time. for thats the stuff life is made of." that is what this amendment is about: to enable americans to use and enjoy their time more fully. and that is why the time has come for the senate to support an extension of daylight savings time.

. i invite the attention of my colleagues to the fact that may is "better speech and hearing month." speech and hearing disabilities are a serious national problemone that affects 16.9 million adults. children. and infants. in my home state of connecticut. there are roughly 40.00 adults. children. and infants with speech difficulties and hearing impairments. the ability to communicate is essential in order to compete in school. at work or in establishing meaningful and healthy relationships with others. persons who can communicate properly as a result of speech and hearing disorders are at an inherent disadvantage. they are singled out in school and pushed aside or avoided by employers. many of these persons can be taught to overcome their disability and be a productive member of society. to achieve this goal. however. prevention. early detection. and improved treatment of such disorders is crucial. i am pleased to e that the state of connecticut has taken the lead in this area. connecticut was one of the first states to enact legislation which provided for special public education services and programs to meet the special needs of those children and young adults with speech and hearing disorders. in this regard. in 1960. the center for communication disorders was established as an independent department within southern connecticut state college. it was charged with the responsibility of training qualified individuals to become speech and hearing pathologists. over the past 16 years. the center has expanded its capacity to provide clinical care for those with these disorders. presently. the center has become a model clinic for southern connecticut and provides treatment and care to 100 clients per week from the outlying community. also this center continually keeps practitioners abreast of the latest procedures and techniques by sponsoring seminars. conventions. research. and classes. since may is "better speech and hearing month." i would like to commend the faculty. staff. and students of this center for their untiring efforts and devotion to those who are in need of special care.
