. the third united nations conference on the law of the sea convenes this week and will again attempt to reach some accord on provisions of the socalled single negotiating text. many speculate that this will be the doordie session for any law of the sea treaty. several nations are preparing to mine the incredibly rich mineral fields of the ocean floor. and without a reasonable treaty. a lawless freeforall for mining rights could ensue. the single negotiating text of the law of the sea conference addresses the problems of unilateral exploitation of the worlds ocean resources. and it is my hope that the conferees in new york today and throughout the next 6 weeks will work in a spirit of peace and unity toward our mutual goal of a reasonable. fair treaty. i am concerned. however. that the tedium of years of negotiations with little solid results mixed with the political jealousies of many of the participating nations. will push the conferees to adopt an inferior treaty. such a treaty may be worse than treaty at all. we must take care that the united states. for one.  be placed at the mercy of an international "authority" which lacks proper guidelines to assure fair dealings with all ocean interests.
