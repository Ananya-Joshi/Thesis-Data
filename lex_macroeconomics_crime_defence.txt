. there is selfgovernment in the power to tax one. to imprison one. and to send one to war is  in ones self. but in those to whom one has voluntarily confided as ones representative. those statements were made back in 1916. and here we are in 1978 still trying to give this basic right of representation to the people of the district of columbia. i hope and pray that my colleagues will go along with this and pass this measure by an overwhelming vote and give the citizens of the district of columbia a right they have so long been denied.
