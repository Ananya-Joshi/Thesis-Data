i do  desire to put any words in the senators mouth. but may we assume. first. that what the majority leader proposes is that the only two that will be considered are the farm bill and the military procurement bill with the conference report on the tax bill. which in any event has priority under the rules. to come in tuesday or wednesday. and that then the civil rights bill will be considered. second. those of us who may feel that other measures would take too long. thus defer the civil rights bill too long. i assume would have. under the procedures which we follow. a number of opportunities. if the senate set aside the farm bill for the conference report on the tax bill. and then came back to it. i assume that if we strongly objected to taking it up again. we could have a vote on that question. if we came to the military procurement bill. we could proceed in the the same way. two items should be cleared of record: first. an understanding with the majority leader as to the bills which will come before the civil rights bill. and. second. the fact that opportunity will be foreclosedas a number of senators may feel that considerations of the two bills to which i have referred will take longer than we have any right to defer the civil rights billto an appropriate way to get at that issue.
