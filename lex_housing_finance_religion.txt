sure. i would like to conclude one statement. president kennedy said "the world isnt totally fair." that is a fact. if you look at it this way. maybe it is  totally fair. the fellow who goes out and has $5.000 equity in his home. i question whether he is buying a $10.000 automobile. but etheless. maybethat is the way he wants to run his affairs. in that case. he does  as the senator pointed out get the deductibility on the interest on his mortgage. here is aher point we took up. you k in this bill you get~deductibility on the mortgage and  only on your principal home but aher home. i thought that is going too far. certainly for the first home. that is motherhood. that is god bless america. but the second home i do  think is quite necessary. so i proposed deductibility of the interest on the original principal residence. question that is right. that is good. but why in the world should we have deductibility of interest on aher home. why  take that money. what you gain by ceasing that. ending that provision in our bill. and set that money aside for the individual to have at least up to that amount of deductible interest. looking at the total there was  much there. the estimates showed us that we come up with something like $500 an individual. if you allow them the deductibility for all consumer interest in lieu of the second home. therefore. we felt it was so tiny that it was  worth going ahead with it.
