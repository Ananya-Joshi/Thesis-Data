 nassers chestnuts out of the middle east fire as we had to do in 1957. and as he is trying to make us do . nassers trip to moscow was preceded by hints of egyptian peacefulness and the desire to be reasonable. semiofficial sources in cairo let it be kn that egypt might be willing to accept united nations peacekeeping forces back in the sinai if the israelis agreed to withdraw. though it was the egyptians themselves who had ordered that force out. when it thought the result would be a sweep of its sovietequipped army over israel in june of 1967. indeed. there were hints that such a prior israeli withdrawal might even be rewarded with eventual permission from cairo to allow israeli cargo to move its cargoes through the suez canal. the egyptian foreign minister implied. in a cryptic sentence to a reporter in copenhagen. that the arabs had been mistaken in failing to ackledge the reality of israels existence. but this final gambit predictably brought an immediate protest from militant arab circles and cairo promptly let it be kn that the foreign minister had been misquoted. how does one deal with this smokescreen of words which hint at something and promise hing. in my judgment. it is essential that we in the united states. especially. keep cool. this will require steady nerves. yet there are some indications that such patience and resolution will pay off. premier kosygins recent indication that his government is interested in an arms limitation agreement in the middle east suggests that the arabs may at last see that their dreams of revenge and military conquest have reached the end of the line. i ask unanimous consent that a press report from geneva dated july 16. 1968. reporting that the soviet delegate to the disarmament conference indicated the u.s.s.r.s conditional interest in an agreement on limitation of shipments of arms to the middle east. be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
