i thank the senator from tennessee. i should like to say to the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from oregon that i made a proposal in a speech monday night in new york for the drafting of a code of ethics both for legislators and for federal officials. the reason i did so was that i had the ho to inaugurate the administration of such a code in the state of new york when i first became attorney general. i invite that to the attention of senators because. after analyzing the bill of the senator from oregon. i agree with the senator from pennsylvania that it poses for us a problem in the dimensions it should have. i found the bill concentrated rather heavily upon the criminal provisions of the statutes. i think it may very well be that a contribution can be made to all of our thinking through some reference to the experience we have had in new york with the code of ethics since 1954. i mention that because i hope very much i shall have the interested attention of the senator from pennsylvania and the senator from oregon. since the senator from oregon has taken such an estimable lead in this matter. when we come to thresh out exactly what we ought to do.
