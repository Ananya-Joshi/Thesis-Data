. the law against discrimination in publicly supported institutions of higher education was established by a series of supreme court decisions long before the separatebutequal doctrine was put to rest for primary and secondary education in the brown against board of education. 1954 decision. as the memorandum shows. some progress has been made toward desegregation in almost every southern state. although the problems remaining are still emous. because of the long history of decisions in this field. i simply call to the attention of the department of health. education. and welfare the facts as they  are and the clear import of the law. which was stated without contradiction by a distinguished panel of legal experts before the education subcommittee in hearings on may 17. 1963. the witnesses cited abundant authority for the proposition that the department  only is authorized. but has a constitutional duty. to withhold federal tax moneys from institutions which practice racial discrimination or segregation. i expect that the department in administering this measure if it ultimately becomes lawas i devoutly laccredited on probation. hope that it shallwill bear in mind what has been said here upon this subject and the basic policy of the united states.
