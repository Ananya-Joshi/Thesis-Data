. the recent torrey canyon disaster which resulted in the despoliation of many of great britains southern coastal waterfront areas by thousands of tons of crude oil points up the need to examine just what action might be taken by our own authorities if a similar situation should arise off the shores of cape cod or of long island or some other u.s. coastline. i think that it is essential  only to protect our shoreline. but to assure the many businesses dependent upon shoreline recreational facilities that our government is taking steps to prevent such occurrences. or at the very least. that it is prepared to act quickly in case of such an emergency. frankly. i do   k whether we need to make changes in our shipping routesas has been done in great britai whether we need to step up our scientific research in the dissolution of oil slick. i feel strongly. however. that we must determine  who is responsible for making decisions in such emergenciesquick decisions that cut through intergovernmental redtape. i am determined that we set this responsibility and find the answers to these questions  and that congress be told what legislation may be necessary to prepare us to act swiftly if our shoreline is threatened by oil slick. in letters to transportation secretary boyd. interior secretary udall. and maritime administrator gulick. i have asked for a report on present procedures. and for any suggestions they might have to prevent such occurrences. in the future.
