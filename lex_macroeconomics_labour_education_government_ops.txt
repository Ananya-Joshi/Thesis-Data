let me finish just one point. it is interesting that the cover of the report to congress by the comptroller general is kind of a syllabus of what is in the report. it says: much good has come from public service employment programs under the comprehensive employment and training act. they provide jobs and other benefits to participants and communities. but several factors lessen the effect of the good things done. too little money in relation to unemployment was provided. funds were  always used to create new job opportunities. relatively few participants obtained permanent unsubsidized jobs.
