i would quote from an article that appeared  too long ago in the atlantic monthly describing what some of the dairy pacs did in the 1982 campaign. and that was some time ago. these pacs gave congressmen at least $1.8 million more than was given by the homebuilders and used car dealers. i do  want to make a big thing of this. but i do  want anybody to think that the voice of the dairymen is  heard in the halls of congress. it certainly is. . the senator also talked about the family farm. and i will asly distinguished colleague from new york a question about the family farm and whether these payments go to dairy farmers on the family farm. it is clearly my impression that the payments. the socalled diversion payments which took place in 1984 were hardly to the struggling family farmer. that is  who we are dealing with. does the distinguished senator from new york have any statistics.

the senator from california is correct in that we have limited the preemption that was included in the house bill. only three categories of new sources. locomotives. farm equipment. and construction equipment. are currently included in the preemption. furthermore. large farm equipment and construction equipment. those rated at more than 175 horsepower. still remain subject to state control. states retain their existing authority to regulate all remaining new road engines or vehicles. in addition. because the preemption is limited to new engine standards only. states can continue to require existing and inuse road engines to reduce emissions by setting fuel requirements. operational conditions or limits on the use of such equipment.
under this resolution. the solution proposed for the freight car shortage is to take ccc grain off the market. i do  k what the cost of grain is in colorado but i can tell the senator that the cost of grain in massacuhsetts has been increasing.  decreasing. our farmers are concerned about the freight car shortage. they are also concerned about the agricultural budget cuts. . to add insult to injury. they feel that by taking the ccc grain off the market there will be a further increase in the cost of grain which will be injurious to the poultry and dairy industries. that is why i asked the question originally of the senator from vermont. who is most kledgeable. and i was pleased to get his response. as i was to get the response of the senator from kentucky. who is in charge of the resolution. but i am heartened to k that in colorado the cost of grain is decreasing. it is about the only place in the country where it is. i did  k there was any other place where we could get a decrease in the cost of grain.
