. on monday. may 4. the gentleman from iowa. congressman fred schwengel. testified before the house foreign affairs committee of which i am a member. our distinguished colleague from iowa put forward a fresh approach for making our foreign policy more effective. and our government closer to the people. the gentleman from iowa. congressman schwengel. proposed a sabbatical leave plan for our foreign service officers. it is his suggestion that when officers return from foreign posts. they spend a year in our own country. rubbing elbows with people from all walks of lifecommunicating with them. giving them a greater awareness of the realities of conducting foreign policy and learning of their attitudes toward international matters. he suggests that they might spend a year in a college community. teaching. lecturing. and exchanging ideas with business. professional. farm and labor groups. i think that the congressmans idea has a great deal of merit. and i want to make it available to all of the members of the house. the gentleman from iowa. congressman schwengel. graciously gave me permission to include his full statement in the body of the record following my remarks. i hope that all members will read the statement and give his idea their thoughtful consideration.
