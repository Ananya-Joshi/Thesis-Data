. i would like to clarify. under this amendment. the right of a financial institution to pay the legal expenses of its officers and directors should it so choose. as the floor manager of the bill ks. there has been some controversy both in the senate and in the house associated with the new supervisory authority which would be created in this legislation. federal regulatory agencies will  have the authority to institute proceedings directly against major stockholders or officers of a financial institution. as a consequence. the personal liability of an institutions officers and directors is potentially expanded to a substantial degree. as a consequence. an issue arises pertaining to the liability of these officers and directors to sustain the personal burden of legal fees which could result from defending their actions in an administrative or review proceeding. in this regard. concern has been expressed that the management of financial institutions have adequate safeguards to protect their legal rights in circumstances which may lead to penalties or cease and desist orders or even removal from office. respondents should have a fair opportunity under mal circumstances to defend their decisions or actions when they find them at issue in supervisory disagreements. it is my understanding that officers and directors who become involved in a disciplinary action could receive assistance from the financial institution involved for payment of their legal fees. an institution would  be required to come to the defense of officers or directors but would have the opportunity to do so if it feels they have acted in good faith in the affairs of the institution. therefore. i would like to k from the chairman of the senate banking committee if this statement accurately characterizes congressional intent on the matter of legal fees contained in this amendment.
