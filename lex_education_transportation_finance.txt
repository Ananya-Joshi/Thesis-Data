. may i make this observation on that subject: i do  wish to foreclose what will be done. but if my colleagues would remember there are 250.000 students in the city university and there are also roughly 250.000 students in the state university system. therefore. the simplistic assumption that the state university system can simply take over the city system is  warranted. it would just be inundated. and both would be destroyed in that case. there must be some intelligent transition. taking account of the fact that in the city of new york. a city of 8 million. many i believe need these facilities. even with federal assistance in the form of educational opportunity grants. and so on. it would still  be possible for the young people to get any kind of college education except by this policy. new york faces a very hard dilemma. it must solve it. it has a 3year period in which it must solve it. or it will go bankrupt late next fall. or something like that. it must solve it. and it will. all i am praying for is. give us an opportunity to solve it. we are very cognizant of how hard our road has been to get any help from the federal government. and this has been one of the deep causes. wisconsin. west virginia. and i think most states have felt that way. we will solve our problem. but give us a chance to solve it in a way compatible with our social problem. which will be very great. maybe you are tempted to say. "cut it out right ." or "the state university should take it over right ." it can be done that way. but we must solve it. because we can make the grade unless we do. and we will. i thank the senator from virginia for his patience.
