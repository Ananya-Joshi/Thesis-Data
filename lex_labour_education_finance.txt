to emphasize a point which i believe to be a good point in the senators amendment. the senator provides for a deduction from adjusted gross income. therefore. if a student works and he has dividend income or interest income. the deduction would be a deduction against the totality of his income. is that correct. that is the meaning of the phrase "gross income". namely. from all sources.
