. i support senator kempthorne and will vote to table the reid amendment. senator kempthornes provision will protect the environment while providing the air wing at mountain home air force base with more realistic training facilities. please e this: the administration supports the compromise in the bill. in fact. the administration wrote the language offered by senator kempthorne. secretary babbitt and secretary cohen have both sent letters of support. as has the acting secretary of the air force.. the compromise language ensures that our environmental laws will fully apply to air force activities at the juniper butte range. this includes the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act. the concessions made by the air force with respect to airspace flight restrictions near the range will reduce the se in the canyon. instead of flights at 100 feet at any time. -the flights are  restricted to 3 days per week and this raises the minimum altitudes from 100. feet to 1000 feet or 5.000 feet depending on the flight angle to the canyon. the kempthorne amendment provision protects the environment and national security. i urge my colleagues to support senator kempthorne.

the senate today is faced with an unprecedented opportunity to provide recreational facilities for almost 10 percent of the nations population who live in the most highly urbanized area of the nation. an area where recreational space is at a premium. -under the proposal before us. the sandy hook area in new jersey and the great kills. breezy point. floyd bennett field. and jamaica bay areas in new york will be combined into the gateway national recreation area. the composite area will serve more than 20 million persons who live within a 2hour drive of the facilities. this exceeds the 15.2 million persons currently served by all six existing national seashore recreation areas in other parts of the nation. for many of those who will be served by the gateway project. it will represent a rare opportunity to play and relax on the beaches and in the ocean. more than 35 percent of those who live within 2 hours of the gateway beaches are members of households with incomes of $5.000 or less. we in new jersey. of course. are most interested in the sandy hook component of the gateway area. sandy hook is a peninsula bounded by the atlantic ocean on one side and sandy hook bay on the other. it consists of 1.634 acres. from 1846 until about 8 years ago. the entire complex was a military reservation kn as fort hancock. early in 1962 it was determined that about 1.200 acres of sandy hook were longer needed for military purposes. the department of the army leased 745 acres to the state of new jersey for a state park. in january 1967. the department of defense annced it would turn over to the general services administration for disposal that area longer needed for military purposes. including the portion leased to the state. early this year. the general services administration. after screening federal agencies. ified the state of new jersey that 1.033 acres of this land were being made available for disposal. in order to preserve sandy hook for recreational purposes. new jersey gover cahill annced that the state was prepared to take title to the surplus property. but the state made it clear that it preferred to have the federal government develop sandy hook for recreational purposes because the state would find it extremely difficult to do so in light of its financial situation. in a letter i received today. the department of the interior says it has programed $643.000 for development. including erosion control. and $865.700 for operating costs at the sandy hook unit during the firsts year after authorization of the gateway national recreation area. while i favor greater resources devoted to erosion control at sandy hook. i recognize that funds for acquisition of land under the project will come from the land and water conservation fund. which was established by a 1965 act for the sole purpose of acquiring land for park use.  for development. the ecology of sandy hook is more fragile and more diversified than that of such components of gateway as breezy point. because of this. the proper development of the area calls for use of sandy hook primarily for environmental and nature studies. hiking. and similar activities. inland from the beaches of sandy hook. a series of relatively unaltered dunes. interspersed with fresh and salt water marshes. provides an excellent opportunity for these activities. which are rare in urban areas. i have been assured by the interior department that sandy hook will be maintained in a manner which will protect its ecological and educational values and that work in this direction will begin as soon as funds are available under the gateway project. i will bend every effort toward that end as development of the recreational area proceeds. at the same time. i am happy that development of the other components of gateway will proceed without undue delay so that there will be a greater area available and single area will suffer extreme overcrowding. in this connection. i am particularly pleased that the great kills area has been included in the bill we are considering. this gives the heavily urbanized area of thern new jersey aher access point to the recreational area. at the same time. the inclusion of floyd bennett field provides additional space to help prevent overcrowding. it is my hope that at least one additional area. liberty state park. which provides an excellent view of the statue of liberty and aher access point for new jerseyites. will be added to the gateway national recreation area in the future. the recreational opportunities offered by the gateway project are urgently needed and i hope that this bill can be enacted into law quickly so that development can begin in the near future.
