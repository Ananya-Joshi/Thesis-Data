right. . i will read to you a memo from the very man who is being quoted here. the chief of naval operations. adm. thomas b. hayward. this memo is to the secretary of defense: you are aware of the navys continuing problem manning ships due to shortages of senior petty officers. in the atlantic. upon deployment three ships are going out in c4 condition. that is  combat ready. and then he mentions in the pacific: some of the ships will be very close to the c4 margin. i am  comfortable with deploying ships with the marginal experience level that these figures represent but the alternatives are even less attractive. he goes on to decry the problems they have with manpower. if they take manpower from one ship to beef up these ships. it is robbing peter to pay paul. continuing: we have reached these limits. we could strengthen the manning by ripping people out of hard earned shore tours short of their inal tour completion date. but such an action would destroy our best retention efforts.
