. i am pleased to support s. 533. the public buildings act. which includes an authorization of $6.8 million for the reation of the post office and courthouse building in new haven. conn. this structure located in the downtown area of new haven sits on church street facing the green and yale university. originally constructed in 1919 and later expanded in 1940. the building has been in dire need of repair for more than 10 years. the $6.8 million authorization provided in this bill will allow for the conversion of this building for the exclusive use of the u.s. courts. u.s. attorney. and* the u.s. marshal. the major items to be provided under this project. include the addition of two courtrooms. a central library. installation of a central heating. ventilating. and airconditioning system. upgrading of the restrooms. fire and lifesafety items. handicapped items. and completion of the tunnel between the courthouse and the adjacent new federal building. i commend senator stafford and the members of the environment and public works committee for taking the responsible action of providing for this badly needed reation of the new haven courthouse building.*
i thank the senator. because i fear many people are having false hopes as a result of the success they expect to come from negotiations between the arabs and the israelis. we certainly in new england. as the senator so well pointed out. depend a lot upon oil which is imported into the country. thank god we  have the allocation act that has been passed. and we will get some relief from that. may i just ask one further question along the lines of the conservation measures. is there any expectation that the commerce committeeand this question is addressed to the majority leaderwill report to the senate a bill on daylight saving time this week.
