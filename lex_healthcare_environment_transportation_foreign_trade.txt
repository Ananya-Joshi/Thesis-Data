. today 1 introduce the pops. lrtap pops. anc pic implementation act of 2003. alone - with senator jeffords. this legisla - tion implements the stockholm con s vention. on persistent organic pollut ants (pops). the converltion on longrange transboundary air pollution (lrtap pops). and the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (pic). with advice and consent by the senate and with passage of this legislation. the united states will appropriately become an active participant in these important international agreements. persistent organic pollutants (pops) are highly toxic and cause adverse health effects. including cancer. reproductive disorders. and immune system disruptions. pops may  break down for years or ddcades. can travel long distances. through air and water. and are kn to bioaccumulate in living organisms. pcbs. ddt. and dioxin are examples of pops. the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants seeks to globally eliminate or severely restrict the production and use of 12 of the most dangerous pesticides and industrial chemicals. ensure the environmentally sound management of pops waste. and prevent the emergence of new chemicals with popslike characteristics. to date. there are 151 signatories and 33 parties to the convention. the legislation we are introducing today implements the key provision of the pops convention which allows additional chemicals to be added to the convention. the bill amends the toxic substances control act to create a process by which the administrator of the environmental protection agency would consider regulating a newly listed chemical to the pops convention or to the lrtap pops protocol. beginning 1 year after a chemical is added by the international body. any person may petition the administrator to commence a rulemaking if one has  been commenced. providing mechanism to include additional chemicals at a future date. with opportunities for public involvement. ensures that the united states will fully implement the pops convention. this bill includes two titles: the first title amends the toxic substances control act (tsca) and the second title amends the federal insecticide. fungicide. and rodenticide act (fifra). senator jeffords and i have worked exclusively to forge a compromise on the first title amending tsca. the secend title amending fifra will be considered by the committee- on agriculture. nutrition. and forestry. the language in this bill amending fifra is intended to serve as a place holder until the committee on agriculture. i nutrition. and forestry has the opport tunity to consider that title. it does  represent a compromise on that title. i believe that this adding mechanism i includes appropriate checks and balg ances. and requires the environmental - protection agency to balance the rel- evant factors when determining how to - regulate a newlylisted chemical. while different parties would craft these provisions differently if starting with a clean slate. i believe that this legislation represents a solid compromise that will allow the united states to fulfill its obligations when gover whitman signed the pops treaty. and will engage the united states as a leading member of the international community regarding toxic substances. by mr. specter:
