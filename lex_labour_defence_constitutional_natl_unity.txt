. of course there is question in my mind that it is always difficult for a democracy to wage war. and it always will be. the most efficient war that can be waged is one that is declared. directed. and ended by one man. in my mind. that is the reason the constitution was drafted in the manner in which it was. it was drafted by men who came from europe where such wars were declared. directed. and ended by one man. they sought to end that situation and to give the people - a voice in whether they should have such conduct continued. that is my understanding. this reinforces my interpretation of the constitution. yes. it is going to be more difficult from a security point of view for this nation to engage in armed conflict. on the other hand. when it does  have the participation of citizens. then we arrive at the point which has been the case in our nation during the past several years. we have a nation that disintegrates. i would ask the senator from arizona. at exactly what point in time would the people of the united states share in the process of whether we should be in conflict.
