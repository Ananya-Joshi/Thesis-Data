we are coming to the aid of greece and turkey because we say there are threats to their territorial integrity or political independence. those are exactly matters with which the charter charges the united nations. and therefore under this amendment we have both lines of action going forward together. we stop deterioration of the international situation which can be stopped  in any other fashion. and at the same time we subordinate ourselves to the judgment and activities of the un.ted nations by askifng it to proceed in the same situation. this has already been done in greece. the charges by greece that her thern neighbors. albania. yugoslavia. and bulgaria. have invaded her thern border are under investigation by a united nations commission. the same thing has  been done in turkey. if the external pressures on turkey are too subtle for detection by the united nations. then those pressures are too subtle for detection by the united states. therefore. the united states should agree that there are external pressures that may be considered by the united nations. while the united states comes forward with the material means by which the condition of the countries it proposes to assist can be stopped from further deterioration .
