i have to respond to the distinguished senator by saying that. unfortunately. we do  k what money the cia does have. that is one of the bones of contention on the floor of the senate today just as represented in this piece of legislation. but god ks where else it is squirreled. i do  k the answer. i do  think anybody else does. either. i do k that we have to draw the line with respect to policy. that is what is being attempted on the floor of the senate today. the other point that has been made is that the united states is involved with two of these factions. one in conjunction with the chinese. aher in conjunction with the south africans. let me point out that the united states is involved with all three factions. as i understand it. the gulf oil co. pays into the banks of luganda some $100 million a quarter. in the way of oil royalties or what have you. and that this money is being used by the russianbacked factions. so. in effect. american dollars. of either governmental entities or this private corporation. are backing all three factions. i think that is a good time to get out. if we are going to be among all three. we can get out and leave everybody at the same time.
i think i would  disagree with the senator if he were talking about. say. his chance to serve in a church or a chance to serve in some calling of that sort. this is a harded business proposition. where these banks are competing with all other financial and similar institutions. private as well as public. for help. and they need it.
