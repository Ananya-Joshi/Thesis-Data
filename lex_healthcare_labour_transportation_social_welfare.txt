. there is one point which i believe will need some clarification. we have already attempted to help those  covered under the insurance phase in the medical care part of the bill.  there are some people who are on government or railroad retirement. at that age. who do receive a pension and who will. etheless. be covered . withstanding that they have quarters of coverage. by virtue of the change which the senator from vermont has made. would he feel. without commiting himself. that his amendment reflects the fairness of that position. the adjustment might very well take place in the conference. but would the senator be sympathetic concerning the fairness in the above situation.
