i thank the senator for his fine contribution. i believe what he has said sharpens the areas of agreement. which are much wider between him and myself. because we have the same attitude toward a broad trade deal. and i have gone to some pains to specify in detail what those conditions should be. an argument has also been made that trade with the soviet bloc would help cuba and that the canadian sale of wheat to russia for cuba involves a very serious breach in u.s. efforts for ecoic and political isolation of the castro regime. what the canadians have done is said to strengthen the soviet position in cuba. by allowing the soviets to take the credit for alleviating the food shortage. two facts can be ed in connection with this argument: first. our own export controls toward cuba still permit cuban purchase of consumable food and medicines. since our objective is  to starve the cuban people who have to live under the castro regime.  to encourage the development of disease and pestilence. second. the heavy cost of maintaining minimum ecoic conditions in cuba still falls on the u.s.s.r. where it should fall. even though they have to buy wheat in canada. in fact. the cost is considerably greater to the soviets in gold than it would be if they were able to supply their own grain to cuba. because they have to spend scarce foreign exchange to buy it. then there is the argument that our farmers recognize the inconsistency of a free world policy whereby we alone attempt to blockade the communist world. but they expect something better than a capitulation to "greedy motives for the quick profit" instead of to plan for the ultimate success and security of freedom. it can be denied that our policy for the past 15 years of placing the morality of our cause above export tradeof denying any possible help to the communist cause--zwas sound. the real question. however. is  whether we 18662: have- been right or wrong up to . or whether a moral position is better than a profit position. the essential question is: what policy will best serve our national interestand the cause of freedomunder present circumstances. the burden of proof in answering this question is upon those who would increase trade with the soviet bloc. that is what i am trying to explore in this speech. at the same time i want to set forth the conditions which would add the necessary weight to the balance in favor of a new policy as against our present policy. conditions for negotiation which. if met. would make a change of policy definitely in the national interest. this is quite apart from the fact that. as a practical matter. we have  really been blockading the communist world. but only cuba and communist china. and i feel this should continue by all means. it can also be argued that an increased volume of u.s. exports of food and industrial commodities would make it possible for the soviet government to modernize its domestic industry and increase the productivity of its capital and labor resources. and that more of its domestic resources and personnel could be diverted toward military production and to stepped up efforts for ecoic assistance to developing countries. but the importance of such trade to the soviet ecoy should  be exaggerated. in aggregate terms. this trade is  of major significance to the soviet blocexcept perhaps psychologically. total imports from bloc sources represent less than 1 percent of soviet gross national product. imports from the industrialized bloc countries. which provide machinery and equipment of principal value to the soviet ecoy. represent only onehalf of 1 percent of soviet gross national product. this trade obviously could  appreciably affect the soviet unions military capability or longterm ecoic growth. soviet military capability is based on its own advanced weapons techogy. the soviet union would be more likely to become dependent upon western sources for military designs and production than the united states would be inclined to rely on soviet sources for american military development. this leaves the question of whether the total denial of western exports to the soviet union might appreciably affect soviet ecoic growth. it seems highly unlikely that this would be possible. because our allies are  conducting substantial trade with the bloc and soviet industry is broadly based on domestic materials and resources. as far as its agricultural sector is concerned. soviet difficulties there are basically the result of institutional defects which are so ingrained in thecommunist system that it is difficult to visualize how they could be cured. short of abandoning that system. this. in fact. is what has happened in the communist countries which have made progress in agriculture. in poland and yugoslavia. agricultural production cix- 1175Â• has been placed on an almost completely free and individual basis. and this is a development we certainly should welcome. in the soviet union problems of inadequate incentives. ineffective procurement and distribution. and the inefficiencies inherent in collectivized or state farming are the governing factors. rather than specific import requirements from the west. for these reasons. if a ban were imposed because of serious new eastwest tensions. the denial of western exports to the soviet union might at most have a shortterm disruptive effect on soviet ecoic planning at a given time. but if there was substantial trade which could be cut off. it would have a much more disruptive effect. trade with the west. as a general matter. however. must necessarily be a marginal factor in the performance and potentialities of the soviet ecoy. on balance. therefore. the potential advantages of increased united statesu.s.s.r. tradeon the terms i propose and considering its order of magnitudewould outweigh the disadvantages. in analyzing the problem of eastwest trade from the standpoint of the national interest over the years since this second world war. the united states has viewed that interest as being involved in four particular areas. first. the possible strategic contribution of exports to the soviet bloc. second. the use by the bloc of trade and related longterm credits as a means of penetrating the lessdeveloped countries in ways that may threaten the growth of independent regimes. third. the potential of the bloc to disrupt world markets. and. fourth. the possibility that certain of the western allies may become unduly dependent upon soviet bloc supplies or markets. a variety of actions and programs have been undertaken over the years to minimize these risks. the multilateral coordinating committeecocomprogram has placed restraints on strategic exports and transshipments. the u.s. foreign aid program. in collaboration with the foreign aid programs of other western countries. has been used as flexibly as possible to counter soviet penetration in lessdeveloped countries and to augment western influence. the new and uncommitted countries have been encouraged to associate themselves with the multilateral trade and financial institutions and the western system of international trade and payments. joint western efforts have been made to deal with such special problems of trade vulnerability as those involving greece or turkey. soviet activities in international commodity markets such as oil or tin have been the subject of western collaboration. efforts have been made through international commodity studies or agreements to meet the marketing problems of lessdeveloped countries and reduce their vulnerability to soviet bilateral trade machinations.
