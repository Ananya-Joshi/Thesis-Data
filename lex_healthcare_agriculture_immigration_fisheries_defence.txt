i agree with the senator that reconstruction is a miser. on this issue two of my colleagues who want to be heard. will likely  be here within the 20minute time limitation. they are strongly opposed to a reduction in the subcommittees proposa 1. their argument is that this is humanitarian assistance. the money is earmarked for refugee relief. child care. health care. agricultural assistance. fertilizer. pol. insecticides. pesticides. agricultural machinery and equipment. rural credit. canal dredging. low lift pumps. and fish farm development. and that e of this money will be used for military assistance at all. i think that their arguments should be heard. although i quite agree that when we talk about reconstruction when a war is still going on. it is a miser. for my colleagues. i want to put that in the record.
