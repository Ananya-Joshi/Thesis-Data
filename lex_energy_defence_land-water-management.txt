. i wish to share with my colleagues a story demonstrating one persons ability to protect the environment from the threat of pollution. for the benefit of wildlife and human enjoyment alike. thirty years after the passage of the clean water act. the blackstone river has shaken off a legacy of neglect and reemerged as a vital community asset. the water quality has improved. a bikeway is under construction. and mill buildings are being restored as apartments and condominiums. the national park service is promoting a new appreciation for the work and culture of the families who have made the blackstone valley their home. and just last week. i joined the army corps of engineers in celebrating the restoration of wetlands in a floodplain that had been paved over for 50 years. so there is a great deal of activity on the banks of the blackstone. while the federal government has been a major player in the rivers rebirth. e of these exciting developmefits would have been possible without the personal commitment of blackstone valley residents. it is their hard work and. more importantly. their heightened vigilance and renewed sense of ownership of the river that have helped it to thrive. one such resident is judy hadley of lincoln. ri a town of about 21.000 people. located on the blackstone river. as the chair of the lincoln land trust. judy is a staunch defender of her towns remaining open spaces and a passionate advocate on behalf of the blackstone. she is active in a number of other local organizations. including the friends of the .blackstone river. the blackstone river watershed council. and the lincoln tree and trail commission. she has organized river cleanups and educated her fellow residents about the impact that stormwater has on the blackstone and its wildlife population. for many years. a 60ton excavator sat abandoned on a manmade island in the river a relic of an old gravel mining operation. it was ai eyesore and a potential environmental hazard. two years ago. judy hadley went to work: canvassing state and federal authorities. trying to find the best solution for this problem. agency seemed to have the right equipment or the resources to handle such an unusual request. but judy persisted. if she could have dismantled it herself and taken it away piece by piece. i think she would have. fortunately. it did  come to that. last year. the rhode island department of environmental management removed more than 300 gallons of diesel fuel and other fluids from the machinery. the excavator itself was finally taken away this summer by the army corps via a temporary land bridge. as part of the wetland restoration project i mentioned earlier. this was a great triumph. and- judy hadleys dedication has been cheered by many local residents. without her persistence. the excavator would still be slowly degrading. leaving open the possibility that oil and fuel would seep out. fouling valuable marsh habitat downstream. walkers and caists would still be shaking their heads at the sight of a rusting hulk across the river. but judy refused to accept the excavator as just aher part of the landscape. insisting that it be removed. in so doing. she has reminded us of the blackstone rivers great worth. as well as its vulnerability. and inspired us to be better stewards of a rediscovered resource. i k my colleagues join me in saluting judy hadley on this achievement..
