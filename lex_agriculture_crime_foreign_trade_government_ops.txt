i voted in favor of the motion of the senator from arkansas to refer the conference report to the foreign relations committee for hearings and study because the findley amendment would weaken the presidents ability to pursue flexible policies in eastern europe and would curtail his freedom of action in a vital area of foreign affairs. moreover. the executive branch was given opportunity to present its views on the amendment. i shall vote to support the conference report because i think on balance. a greater good is involved in this program. public law 480 has been of incalculable benefit to many recipient countries of the free world as well as to the united states during the past 10 years. our program in poland and yugoslavia has contributed to the reversal of farm collectivization in both countries and to a moderation of oppressive police practices. while the conference report would stop further sales for local currency under titlb i to both poland and yugoslavia. it would permit continued sales under title iv for hard currencies. credit terms to poland would be limited to 5 years. while to yugoslavia 20year credits could be continued. inasmuch as in recent years sales to both countries have been made increasingly on commercial terms. the effect of this prohibition should  have a major impact on sales. thus. i think we have a balance of greater good which is involved in the program. i shall rely upon the statement of my senior colleague. the senator from vermont . that from that point of view. the report should be agreed to.
