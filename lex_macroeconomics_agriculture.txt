. i think it most unfortunate that the house did  approve the amendment to the public works appropriation bill yesterday that would have increased the appropriation for the water pollution control act from the $203 million requested by the administration to the full $450 million unanimously authorized last year. in anticipation of the availability of these funds. many communities have stepped up the planning for their sewage treatment works construction. the clean waters restoration act passed last year authorized $450 million for assistance to localities for this purpose and i think that the congress. once having recognized the magnitude of this problem. must. as a matter of national priority. provide the funds to meet it completely. the sewage treatment construction provided for by the 1966 legislation. furthermore. represents only the beginning of a major national effort that is absolutely essential to combat water pollution. while the public works appropriation bill is over $300 million larger than the comparable measure for the last fiscal year and while it clearly includes far too many items that can only be classified as pork barrel legislation. i would have considered voting for it had there been full funding for the clean waters program.
. this mechanism of providing price support for wheat is unjust and has penalized both the consumer and the bakery industry. the quicker this tax is eliminated the better off we are in helping to avoid an increase in the staff of life. bread.

. i am glad to join a number of distinguished senators as a consponsor of concurrent resolution  88. submitted by senators nelson. javits. hart. and humphrey. the resolution would charge the joint ecoic committee with the establishment of an advisory board to study the causes of the current combination of doubledigit inflation. high unemployment. and ecoic slowdown and to make recommendations to deal with both the short- and longrange aspects of these problems. a traditional criticism of such an approach is that we dont need aher committee and aher studywe need to act. i would like to answer both parts of this objection ahead of time. for one thing. we are acting on a number of fronts. i regret that a majority of my colleagues did  support extension of standby authority for wage and price controls. since i firmly believe the administration and the congress together must act positively to bring inflation under control. but additional constructive legislative proposals have been made. ranging from the establishment of export control and licensing procedures for agricultural commodities to the establishment of a federal oil and gas corporation. so i think we are attempting to act in areas where certain clear legislative options are at hand. at the same time the combination of ecoic trends that we  face is unique. and i think we need to give the joint ecoic committee the resources to study this situation. to look at this new set of circumstances. and perhaps to devise new approaches to the perplexing problems that are upon us. for many years . for example. one prevailing school of thought has held that continuing sophisticated techogical advances will always. and indefinitely. enable us to keep pace with growing demand. but questions are arising about the soundness of this view. and it is longer inappropriate to ask whether there will always be egh natural gas or other basic resources to produce egh fertilizer to grow egh wheat to feed a hungry world.  is it too soon to raise the question whether some measure of our worldwide inflation results from a general feeling that we may face a future in which material progress is  the rule and that each of us had better scramble to "get ours" while the getting is still good. if this is so. what can we do about it. i would strongly urge the advisory board to take a broad look at this kind of question. among others. and to explore the inflationary effects of increasing competition for dwindling supplies. in this connection. i ask unanimous consent to include at this point in the record a new york times editorial of june 9. 1974. and an article from the june 21 times by senator nelson and senator hart dealing with our general ecoic situation and discussing this timely concurrent resolution.
. the wagestabilization decision annced this morning will  succeed unless real price stabilization accompanies it. yet price stabilization remains shackled by the "sacred cow" provisions of the defense production act insofar as agricultural commodities and food prices are concerned. director disalle wires me in just so many words that "ops can place ceiling prices on foods or agricultural commodities that are below parity because of the restrictions in the act." legislation is pending to change those restrictions but can get a hearing before the banking and currency committee unless the administration pushes the button. my bill. house bill 1778. seeks to establish the standard for price stabilization at the actual support price of commodities under the pricesupport program. thereby cutting the pricestabilization basis to 90 percent of parity for the six basic commodities and to lower percentages of parity for the approximately 70 other commodities under the support program and still selling under 100 percent of parity. by failing to press for such amendment in the face of its own prediction that food prices will rise before the middle of the year by as much as they have already risen since the korean operation began the administration invalidates its own price stabilization efforts. the whole problem bears very heavily on city dwellers. consumers food prices are estimated to be up 8 percent over what they were when the korean action started. and food is allocated a weight of nearly 40 percent in the cost of living index. as compared with this rise in food the consumers price index for all items generally is up about 5 percent. i would like to make a special appeal to those who represent farm areas. the current buyers strike on meats in new york is  capricious but a deep and sincere protest by the people. government parity price floors and guaranties are  involved. they would continue anyhow. but if farmarea members would join city members to unshackle  the power to really halt inflation in food prices it would be the greatest longrange goodwiil action for the continuance of government aid to farm prices that they could possibly take. price stabilization controls are only a halt to let the basic steps of increased production. credit control. adequate taxation and governmental ecoy. which are the real inflation controls. manifest their effects. these will be just as beneficent for the farmer as for the city worker and employee. it is  how many dollars we have but what they will buy that really counts both in the city and on the farm. the monthly letter of the national city bank of new york for february 1951 says on this subject:
. i shall support this amendment for the cogent reasons developed during the debate and because it gives the substance of such soilconservation program as is in the interests of all our people. farmers and city consumers alike.. i refer especially to the effort being made in the debate on this amendment to impress a good many members with the fact that in their own districts they will face retribution if they support the amendment. i think that is unfair to consumers in the cities. for. what is very important as we look at the overall picture of the country. and i think many people will agree with me. is that what the american people wanted from the administration they put in power was that the administration "call them as they see them." to use a baseball term. the american people wanted the administration to be evenhanded. the farmers have very high fixed price supports for their principal commodities . there are over $3 billion of federal government money tied up right  in an emous amount of farm commodities. including 150 million pounds of spoilable butter. one hundred and forty million dollars seems right to the administration as a figure for the soilconservation program. it is a fair balance. says the administration. as between what the farmers ought to have and what the city dwellers ought to pay taxes to support. the sum of $140 million will. i believe. cover the soilconservation program adequately. i can conceive of the secretary of agriculture. mr. benson. wanting to see the soil of this country washed away. one of the fears expressed here. i hope my colleagues will realize that what the american people are looking to from them and looking to from this administration is that which is in the interest of the whole of the united states.  currying favor with some particular group in some particular district. if the administration is supported by the congress in sticking to the fact that it is serving the whole country. it will repeat in 1954 what it did in 1952. i believe. and  otherwise.
. we have had this argument about section 104 up before. i think that those of us who represent the big cities have a duty here as deep and profound as those who represent the farm districts. it is a duty i have tried to sustain. but i believe on the whole. however. it has  been sustained here. that is the duty to speak the interest of the consumer on the house floor. the consumer is one of americas forgotten men. yet it is an extremely serious problem to the bigcity people. the difficulty with section 104 in brief is this: it is true that the price of dairy products is under price support. as a matter of fact. the advisory committee on dairy interests has already recommended that we go to a flexible farm price policy. these are dairy farmers speaking. because dairy farmers themselves see the danger of the regimentation of their own field of activity if they keep these high fixed farmprice supports. with 165 million pounds of butter under price support in storage today and likely to spoil unless we give it away. and with the price of butter way out of line in competition with margarine. and more and more piling up every day. because one has the courage to stay. "stop. let the american people use this butter at reasonable prices. which they will pay." the difficulty with the argument in favor of section 104 is that this way the consumer is being made to pay both ways. first. foreign competition is cut out. hence it has impact upon price and makes for higher prices of butter and cheese and other items. and second. he is paying in taxes for a high fixed farmprice support program. if section 104 is stricken. and as i understand. it was the view of the administration it should be stricken. at least our attention would be fixed singly upon what the farm parity price program is doing in connection with butter. and so forth. which is in a fair way to become a repetition of the great potato scandal. so i am all for striking this section. let us see what is being done with respect to dairy products as far as the american market is concerned. and  saddle the consumer. who is also a taxpayer. with both costs of high prices and taxes to maintain highprice supports. therefore. i think this amendment is entirely right.
first. i should like to compliment my colleague on the fine presentation he is making of the case for all of us. rather than simply stating his own point of view. second. i should like to join with my colleague from illis in respect to the matter of the effect on the large cities. the cities of new york. buffalo. syracuse. rochester. albany. schenectady. troy. and a whole host of other cities in new york will suffer because everything which is to be provided under the bill will be just about "soaked up" on july 1. and there will be hing left for the rest of the year. we have had experience in that matter already. one thing which i should like to emphasize with my colleague is that time is  standing still for the large cities. the time bomb is ticking in those cities. new york is  gaining population at the rate other areas are gaining. and is really falling back in terms of population. what will happen as the result. it is idle to assume that the senators from rural communities in this chamber have interest in new york. in the first place. new york is a tremendous generator of taxes and of personnel for the united states. with what are we going to compete with the russians. will it be the population of farm communities in southern illis.
. we must move to correct this situation. which promises but to feed the fires of frustration and resentment. to that end senator yarborough and i introduce a bill to provide $150 million in supplemental funds for summer jobs and antipoverty programs. we are joined in this bipartisan endeavor by 19 senators. senators brewster. brooke. case.
i should like to make a correction. the senator may  have been in the chamber when i analyzed the budget message of the president. one of the uncontrollable expenditures. and therefore one which would  be in any way affected by my amendment. is farm price supports. which is budgeted at $2.9 billion for 1969. when i outlined what would be available for cuts. even after my amendments were adopted. i pointed out that that would  include what the budget calls relatively uncontrollable civilian programs. among which is farm price supports. . whatever there may be to the senators argument. that is a point of fact. that would  be affected.
. i will  take the time of the senate to read them all but i will read some of them to give the senate an idea of what this is about. as i said. the list is roughly 60 selected tax provisions estimated to cost $40billion in lost revenues. i will try to pick some of the large ones. it relates to farm expense and capital gain treatment. $820 million. it relates to excess of percentage over cost depletion. $980 million. it relates to in-
