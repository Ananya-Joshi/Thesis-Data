exactly. i am coming to that. the senator from arkansas is most perceptive. chairman khrushchev is most eager to increase trade. and i believe he has illusions that he can euchre us out of the idea that we will  trade and will  let anyone else trade with russia in strategic goods. that is practically shown by the fact that the german bundestag turned down a pipe deal with the russians by voting  to trade in strategic goods. the free world is well united on that score. khrushchev has illusions. . the soviet union has serious ecoic problems. the senator from arkansas has just pointed out that the soviet union is unable to raise egh food for its own people. and it is making largescale wheat purchases in the free world. the $500 million purchase from canada is a great deal of money. the essence of what i say is that we should trade with khrushchev.  that we should open our doors wider.  that we should give him creditsthat in exploring what can be done and what can be done. it is well to find out what khrushchev is willing to do if he does find greater opportunities to expand his trade with the free world. if we find that this is practical. we can protect ourselves against the risk of adverse effects on world trade by insisting. at one and the same time. that the communist bloc accept and act according to the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade which deal with dumping. with selling below cost. and with other unfair practices. the russians are   a party to it. and on occasion they hurt usas. for example. in connection with tin. flax. and fuel oil. and as to them. they could. if they chose. hurt us again. so if we do explore that situationwhich could be fruitful. and i am prepared at a later date to make a fulldress review of that situation. which i believe is needed. at the same time. it would promote greater unity among the free world nations in their trade policies with the communist countries. these are. to my mind. the five most positive political advantages. there are otherssome of which have been advanced many timesbut there are some who still insist they have  heard them. or who ige them. so i would like to cite others which i deem significant. although thus far in this debate i have referred to those i consider to be extremely interesting or el. but just to be sure that the recapitulation is complete. i shall restate them. so that the case will be complete. i state frankly that they are  mine.
