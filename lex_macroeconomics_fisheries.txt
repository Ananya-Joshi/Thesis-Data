. although i will support h.r. 11880. i would like to call to the attention of this body an example of what i regard as a totally indefensible policy that concerns the furnishing of our embassies throughout the world. i was troubled when i read in the new york times of friday. july 20. 1962. an article appearing on page 11 of that issue. entitled "elegance prevails in u.s. embassies throughout the world." in the course of the article. which appeared under the byline of charlotte curtis. appears a very disturbing paragraph. let me read it: although most furnishings ordered by the state department are designed and made in the united states. some are bought abroad. most of the sterling silver platters. trays. and flatware used in the official building abroad are made in lima. peru. i can help but wonder what our american silversmiths. many of whom are located in my home state of massachusetts. might think upon reading this report. i am reliably informed that for many years other nations have been pirating american patterns. producing exact duplicates which are heavy in silver but otherwise of inferior quality. can the purchase by the state department of peruvian silver for use in our embassies be regarded as other than discrimination against the silverware industry of the united states which helps to pay the taxes that contribute to the support of those very embassies. although i supported the trade expansion act which this house passed recently. i am convinced that the purchasing policies of the state department require an immediate examination. as well as a continuing review. and. it seems to me. when guests at our embassies abroad examine their shrimp forks. they should reasonably expect to find that they are americanmade products. and i will welcome an explanation of this purchasing policy by the secretary of state.
. what we proposed in the finance committee was that the same requirements be levied upon the private schools that are levied upon the public schools. that the private schools abide by the same requirements as the public schools in connection with the mainstreaming of the handicapped. as it were. that is what we call going to a level playing field. and that is what was proposed. i would say to the senator from th carolina. who is very thoughtful in this matter. that we are coming right  up to the starting line. if i can mix a metaphor we have to fish or cut bait here. this is  something that will pass and then be followed by the writing of regulations. without action by this body there will  be a requirement that participating private schools treat the handicapped children exactly as the public schools must. without action by this body. if this measure should pass. there will  be a requirement that the private schools accept those with learning disabilities or those for wvhom english is  an original language or those who have disciplinary problems. as you k. uinder title ix public schools in the nation must provide equal programs for female students but when we proposed in the finance committee that private schools which benefit from these tax credits abide by the same rules. this was rejected. what does that do to a community.

. the town of narragansett has been trying to purchase and preserve a parcel of land in the thern section of pettaquamscutt cove kn as bridgepoint commons along the narrows river. the town has received a state grant of almost $800.000 and is prepared to supplement that with a sizable contribution of its own. the wetlands portion of this parcel is within the expected boundaries of the new pettaquamscutt cove national wildlife refuge. in addition. the wetlands qualify for federal funding under the emergency wetlands resources act of 1986. i am in the process of working with the town and the u.s. fish and wildlife service to see if a portion of the $8 million we appropriated for wetlands acquisition in fiscal year 1989 can be used to help the town of narragansett preserve bridgepoint commons. the idea is to help the town save this important area while. at the same time. getting the federal government to buy the first piece of this new national wildlife refuge. i hope to have an anncement on this matter in the next few weeks. i thank the senate for its help in this matter and look forward to continuing our efforts to preserve open space throughout the nation. the amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.
. i am pleased to cosponsor this bill with my colleague senator allard. this bill represents a move towards efficient use of government funds. and support for the valuable programs carried out with those scarce funds. the bill would initially generate approximately $1 million for the service through the sale of items derived from fish and wildlife that are currently stored by the service. this money would be used to cover the costs of disposing of these itemswhich is  a financial drain on the serviceand to fund programs that loan these items to schools and native american groups for educational and religious purposes. each -year. the fish and wildlife service (service) receives hundreds of thousands of items derived from fish. wildlife and plants. such as skins. furs. feathers. jewelry. etc. these items can be seized. forfeited or abandoned during enforcement of federal wildlife laws. and they are eventually shipped to the national wildlife property repository in colorado. the repository currently has about 150.000 items. with about 50.000 items stored elsewhere. under current law. the service may dispose of fish. wildlife or other items forfeited or abandoned to the u.s. government. either by loan. gift. sale or destruction. there are certain restrictions on disposal of those items. for example. items made from threatened or endangered species. marine mammals and migratory birds can be sold according to the laws that apply to those particular species. revenue from the sale of forfeited items go to the service for certain program operations. however. revenue from the sale of abandoned items go to the general treasury. and are  available to the service. more than 90 percent of the. fish and wildlife items are abandoned. so that the service would receive very little revenue from sales of these items. indeed. under current law. the costs of selling these items would outweigh any revenue. bo that the service has incentive to sell them. the service must further expend funds for the shipment. storage and disposal of the items that it acquires. in addition. the service will make many of these itemsthose that can be sold under lawavailable for native american religious and ceremonial purposes. educational purposes. and research. but must expend its own funds to do so. the repository was appropriated s310.000 for operations last year. after overhead. only $61.000 was available for disposal of these items. disposal includes two programs in particular. the first. kn as cargo for conservation. provides wildlife specimens to schools for educational programs. under this program. the service has distributed almost 400 educational kits to various organizations. the second program provides eagle carcasses and parts to native americans for religious and ceremonial purposes. under this program. the service has filled almost 1.500 requests for eagles. eagle parts and other raptors in 1997 alone. although there is currently a two year backlog in filling orders for some eagle carcasses. the bill would specifically amend the fish and wildlife improvement act in two ways. first. it would authorize the deposit of proceeds from the sale of for. feited and abandoned items into service accounts rather than into the general treasury. second. it would expand the use of funds received through these sales to include costs incurred by shipping. storage and disposal of these items. as well as payment of any liens on these items. i would like to e that this bill does  change existing authority with respect to items that may be sold by the service. it does  allow the sale of items derived from threatened and endangered species. marine mammals. or migratory birds. the service already has authority to sell certain items for which it is lawful to do so. this bill merely allows the service to keep revenues derived from any items it sells. and to use those revenues for certain programs. this is a bill representing efficient use of government funds. at the same time. this bill is  intended to imply that the service should sell everything that it lawfully can in order to maximize profits. it is my understanding that the service has intention to sell items derived from sensitive species. including those that are candidates for listing as endangered or threatened. it is also my expectation that. in considering which items to sell. the service would take into account the biological status of any species used for that item. and any implications that the sale may have for conservation efforts relating to that species. for example. any sale by the service should  encourage new markets that may undermine protections elsewhere. lastly. the service should ensure that the sale of these items does  undermine enforcement efforts within the u.s. in summary. i am pleased to cosponsor this bill with senator allard. our staffs have worked closely with each other and with the administration in drafting this legislation. and i look forward to working on this bill in the future. by mr. chafee (for himself. mr. kempthorne. mr. lotr. mr.

. today i rise to cosponsor and express my full support for s. 121. legislation introduced by. senator roth earlier this session which would create a new department of international trade and industry. our growing trade deficit clearly demonstrates the need for a cohesive and effective u.s. trade policy. there have been several thoughtful and concise statements made over the past several months concerning the need for and the function of this new department. i would like to limit my comments today to an aspect of the bill which has to date received little attention. as reported out of the governmental affairs committee. title iii of s. 121 would establish the national oceanic and atmospheric administration [a] as an independent agency. currently. with 12.000 employees. a comprises approximately 60 percent of the department of commerces budget. the establishment of an independent agency responsible for the oceans and the atmosphere would serve to focus ocean and atmosphere processes and aid in establishing a coherent program to promote understanding. development. management. and protection of ocean and atmospheric environments. this is far from a el idea. as far back as 1969. the stratton commission. formally kn as the commission on marine science. engineering. and resources. recommended the creation of an independent national ocean agency. "our nation and the sea." the stratton commissions final report. called for effective. coordinated management of oceanrelated activities through the consolidation of federal ocean programs within a single agency. the creation of a in 1970 was an important first step in attempting to follow the commissions recommendations. its mission to manage. conserve. and develop oceanic and atmospheric resources has been strengthened by the passage of numerous laws. establishing a as the lead civilian agency. today a provides essential public services involving the atmosphere and oceans. establishes federal policies governing the use of marine resources. and conducts oceanic and atmosphere research. which is essential to the support and delivery of these services. i addition. as mission also includes significant international research and treaty responsibilities involving weather. oceans. and climate. during the past several years. however. severe budgetary pressures have greatly jeopardized as ability to accomplish its mission. additionally. many of as responsibilities do  directly relate to the nations ecoy. the main orientation of the department of commerce. when as decisions have been based on environmental concerns and have conflicted with ecoic concerns. the commerce department has seldom come down on as side. if this nation intends to continue to provide timely and accurate weather forecasting and if we intend to wisely manage our valuable marine resources. then we must have a viable agency responsible for these areas. independent status for a would greatly enhance our ability to address and meet these challenges. it would be different if a had  done a good job. over the years. i have carefully followed the progress a has made in dealing with ocean and atmospheric problems. i have been greatly impressed with the way a has grappled dealing with many complex questions. the level of expertise and sense of dedication exhibited by a personnel is indeed a credit to the agency it must  only continue. but in several areas it must be expanded. to cite an example. consider our marine resources. the passage of the fishery conservation and management act of 1976 was a clear statement of this nations commitment to wise management of those resources. despite its passage and in spite of the fact that we have the worlds richest fishing grounds within 200 miles of our coast. 70 percent of the fish consumed in this country is imported. our trade deficit in fish products alone totals nearly $3 billion. an independent a is the logical next step in following the recommendations made by the stratton commission. during the past decade. the oceans have been increasingly relied upon to both feed and supply energy to our growing population. the pressures placed upon the oceans are  likely to diminish in the future. all indications are that they will continue to mount. since the oceans are bound to play an ever increasing role in the welfare of this country. a can undoubtedly best serve the nations interest as an independent agency with the requisite funding and attention at the federal level. it is time congress passed legislation to accomplish this goal.*
