 would be required to submit a report to congress within 1 year of enactment of this legislation explaining steps that the united states could take to promote cooperation by other countries to prevent bribery. i would point out that senatehouse discussions which took place during the fall and early winter of 1982 on this proposal produced some important and worthwhile :.uggestions. as the author of the original bill. i will go so far as to say that that dialog could lead to some improvements and to some tightening of the senate bill. in this regard. i suggest that some of those ideas be considered during the senate markup of this bill. but let us  waste aher congress. aher year. or aher month. we are losing overseas business and jobs each day we delay. it is my sincere hope that the senate banking committee will consider this legislation in february and that the senate will again show the leadership it demonstrated in 1981 and unanimously pass reforms to the fcpa before april 1. i also do hope that the house subcommittee on telecommunications. consumer protection. and finance will produce a bill this spring so as to make full congressional approval a reality before the summer. action on this matter is long overdue. i remain committed to the enactment of this bill and will do all i can to achieve that goal this year.e by mr. hatfield:

. many small businesses are presently faced with an ecoic squeeze between inflationary cost increases and fixed price contracts made with the federal government. the legislation i am introducing today with senator hathaway and nine other senators will provide muchneeded relief for small businesses facing serious financial loss as a result of these negotiated agreements. the contracts affected are those entered into during the period of price controls from mid1971 until early 1974. since that time the controls have been lifted resulting in small firms facing spiraling inflation costs due to material shortages and the energy crisis. although federal agencies have been sympathetic to these concerns. they have lacked the legislative authority to provide any form of relief. this bill. the small business emergency relief act. would grant these agencies the scope to terminate for the convenience of the government any fixed price contract made during the price control period between the agency and a small business concern. this legislation will  provide a bailout to small business concerns. it merely prevents a firm from taking any additional losses that might lead to bankruptcy. in addition. those firms must supply evidence that their losses were  the result of negligence or deliberate underbidding. contractors affected would only have a specific time limitation ending december 31. 1975. to apply for relief from contractual agreements. small businesses across the country face financial losses that could lead to disastrous consequences. unless the congress takes action  to provide relief. many small firms will be strangled. by mr. chiles (for himself. mr. weicker. mr. nunn. and mr. glenn):
