. the commonwealth of massachusetts has taken a remarkably inative direction in the design and implementation of a food and agriculture policy which may serve as a national model. massachusetts is a foodconsuming state. we import fully 85 percent of all we eat. therefore. our food costs are often 10 percent higher than the national average. and our most critical agricultural problem is that we are rapidly losing precious farmlands to urban development or to the pressures of an agribusinessbased food ecoy. in recognition of the serious food supply problems the state faces. former gov. francis w. sargent formed the govers commission on food. which issued its excellent final report over a year ago. based on the analysis and recommendations contained therein. the administration of gov. michael s. dukakis has gone on to formulate a visionary food and agriculture policy. the directions massachusetts will take. under the guidance of the able commissioner of agriculture frederic winthrop. jr.. together with secretary of environmental affairs evelyn murphy. are set forth in a report issued last ember. other food consuming states. particularly those which like massachusetts are situated in the highly urbanized regions of the nation. may wish to take similar action to increase and protect a moderatecost food supply and to protect our precious vanishing farmlands. the papers speak for themselves. and i ask unanimous consent that "in search of a food policy." and "a policy for food and agriculture in massachusetts." be printed in the record.
