. it seems to me that we have a lot of things we ought to be doing around this place. what are some of them. well. i think we all recognize our education system in the united states needs some attention. i think we are all concerned about the recent peace agreement in bosnia. whether we should commit our troops or whether we should  commit our troops. we are all worried about the budget. how to balance it. what to do. what programs to increase. what programs to reduce. this is a matter of major concern to americans. i believe our health care system is deserving of all the attention we can give to it. each of these measuresand there are others we can think ofare deserving of the hard work and attention of this body. . is flag burning an offensive act. of course. it is. we all recognize that. and rightfully americans are upset by it. but it seems to me that if we value the freedoms that define us as americans. we will refrain from taking an action like this to amend our constitution. i just want to read two letters. one from a boy scout in rhode island. who wrote me on this subject: dear mr. chafee: i am a boy scout of troop 1 east greenwich. and i am a member of the civil air patrol. i am writing to say that i am against amending tle constitution to prohibit burning the flag as a protest. i think this because. in this country. you have the right to protest peacefully. burning the flag may be offensive. but if everything offensive were to be outlawed. then this country would  be as free as it is today. thank you for your consideration. sincerely.
