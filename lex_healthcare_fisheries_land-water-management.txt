. confirmed by the senate. and under the supervision of the assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks. although i strongly support establishing a program to improve natural resource inventory and monitoring. i am  yet convinced that creating a separate office or bureau is the best means to accomplish this objective. nevertheless. secretary babbitt has put forward a detailed proposal which merits the full consideration of congress. the introduction of this bill is intended to serve as a starting point and to provide an opportunity for a full discussion of how best to improve our information about species and ecosystems. kledge regarding biological resources is of great ecoic value. for instance. more than 40 percent of all prescription drugs are derived from plants and other organisms. yet. fewer than 3 percent of the worlds kn species have been examined for possible use as medicines. this data could also be used to develop and improve agricultural crops and in biotechogy research. such kledge will benefit all of us. if we are going to get ahead of the curve and conserve species before they become endangered. we need better and more comprehensive information about species and ecosystems. the establishment of the national biological survey could assist government and private interests alike in managing natural resources more effectively and avoiding conflicts with ecoic interests.0
