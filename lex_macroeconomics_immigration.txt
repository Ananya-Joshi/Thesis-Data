. i should like at this time to extend by warmest welcome to the order of ahepa. the american hellenic education progressive association. gathered here in washington for its 44th international convention. my greetings also to those members from canada. australia. the bahamas. and greece. i am especially pleased to e the number of participants from the fifth district of massachusetts: from lowell. mass.: hermes s. tsandikos. william kyros. charles tsaffaras. ernest n. kotosopoulos. charles j. kirkiles. john maniatis. efthemios j. bentas. john ruscomanis. peter s. chiandikos. peter paras. arthur j. collias. and james athanasoulas. from woburn. mass.: charles peras and evangelos spa. over a century ago. daniel webster. then a member of the house of representatives. called the attention of the house to the debt the civilized world. and especially the democratic world. owed to the heritage from ancient greece. so i. at this moment. call the attention of the house to an association whose principles join the love and appreciation of democratic nations with a love and continuation of hellenism and hellenic culture from which the ideals of democratic citizenship have come. great tribute is due the order of ahepa and its members for their vigorous participation in both national and international projects. it has become an active element in our nations peopletopeople program. promoting international harmony. the worthy charitable causes which have received aid from ahepa make a long and impressive list. the 56 wreaths placed at the graves of greekamerican veterans in arlington cemetery this year are. i feel. the most profound symbol of the principles embodied by this association. the goals and efforts of ahepa are an invaluable benefit.  only to the nation but to humanity. it is my privilege to have had this opportunity to express by esteem for this organization. my best wishes to the representatives of ahepa for a successful convention and an enjoyable week in washington.
