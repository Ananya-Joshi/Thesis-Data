s commission on civil disorders. the latest report of the lemberg center is based on a study of disorders since the assassination of dr. martin luther king in april of this year. the study. which was made public on august 19. of course. excludes the latest series of disturbances. in examining the course and pattern of violence in the months since april 4. the researchers were puzzled by the fact that a large number of disturbances did  appear to be related to the assassination. thus. in april 1968. there were 34 unrelated civil disorders. compared with only seven disorders for the month of april 1967. the trend of escalation of disorder predicted by the lemberg center in earlier published reports has been borne out. but even more disturbing to the researchers was the fact that an increasing number of all disorders began or focused on the public schools. the insensitivity of a school administrator or teacher. tensions in the classrooms. suspected discrimination in the selection of students for sports or special hos. could all become triggering or precipitating events. the researchers likened the situation to a dry year in a forest zone: if all the forests are dry. how can we anticipate who will drop a lighted cigarette. or how many. or where. we are limited to predicting the high probability of forest fires occurringsomewhere. because the conclusions of the researchers has particular significance for all of us. in every state in the union. i ask unanimous consent that the text of that part of the study relating to "schools as centers of racial unrest" be printed in the record.
