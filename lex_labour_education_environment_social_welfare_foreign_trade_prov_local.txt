 nixon has taken to focus national attention on the environment and on action to clean up the environment. specifically. there is the basic need in our schools today to have pro.grams that are multidisciplinary. that will change attitudes. that will encourage curriculum development. and that will make it possible for children in elementary and secondary schools to get the kind of education that will influence their judgment as a nation in the future. the bill will also help the development of adults and community education programs. foster the dissemination of significant environmental education material throughout our land. and make possible the conduct of teacher training programs in this field. the major import of this bill lies in the fact that environmental. education is neither the exclusive province of the scientists or of the humanists. effective environmental education requires the blending of various disciplines into a total view of man reacting with his natural and manmade environments. to help gain a view of the whole. to help clarify the relationships among disciplines. the bill encourages various programs. such as outdoor ecological study centers. that will enable the student to leave his textbooks and to venture out to apply some of the principles he has been studying. . in my view this is one of the key bills to be acted on in this congress. the funds provided for education programs will help to shape the attitude of a whole generation of young americans toward their environmentand it is that attitude which may well determine the future of our planet. i urge the approval of this bill. and it is my understanding that the labor and public welfare committee in the senate is close to taking action on this measure as well. the senate subcommittee has already reported the bill unanimously.
