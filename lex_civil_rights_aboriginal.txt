. today marks the 70th anniversary of the declaration of independence of the republic of estonia. i am hoed to join with estonianamericans and estonians throughout the world in commemorating this day and in showing support for estonian people in their difficult struggle to gain independence. on february 24. 1918. the people of estonia proclaimed their independence and freedom. estonian independence was confirmed in 1920 when the soviet union signed a peace treaty with estonia recognizing the new republic and rencing all rights of sovereignty over tile estonian people. for 20 years. the small democratic nation of estonia flourished. estonia became the first nation in the world to grant all its linguistic miities cultural autoy. during this brief period. the estonian people further strengthened their strong national consciousness and pride. in 1939. estonias peace and freedom fell victim to soviet expansionism. the illegal soviet annexation of estonia brought extreme hardship. for the last 46 years. the estonian .:ople have endured widespread deportation. execution. and emigration. between 1939 and 1949 alone. 350.000 estonians died. out of a total population of 1.25 million. tile united states has never recognized the soviet occupation of estonia or its balic neighbors. latvia and lithuania. i admire the estonians spirit and national pride which has persevered despite continuing soviet attempts to deprive estonia of its cultural heritage. in the midst of daily oppression by the soviets. estonias resistance movement continues to grow. estonian citizens recently annced tile formation of the estonian national independence party to promote human rights and selfdetermination of the estonian republic. as the estonian people mark the 70th anniversary of estonias independence. we must never forget their difficult struggle for freedom and selfdetermination. as the leader of the free world. the united states should reaffirm our commitment to human rights and to the people of estonia.*
. i would concur with that and in addition. for additional support of that interpretation. i would refer the senator to section 803 (a) in which financial assistance for native american projects is called for. that reads: sec. 803. (a) the secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to public and profit private agencies. including but  limited to. governing bodies of indian tribes on federal and state reservations. alaskan native villages and regional corporations established by the alaska native claims settlement act. and such public and profit private agencies serving hawaiian natives. and indian organizations in urban or rural reservation areas. for projects pertaining to the purposes of this title. therefore. even at the extreme. the senator might have to get his help from the secretary under this bill through a profit private agency. which he would anyhow. community action prngrams. in order to qualify under 803 (a). i would suggest. too. senator. that the senator offer the amendment for the record. so that it may be clear as to the definition which he is making technical.
