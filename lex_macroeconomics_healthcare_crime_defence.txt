i am pleased to join my distinguished colleague. senator hawkins. in sponsoring this bill to terminate aid to bolivia unless it begins to cooperate with u.s. efforts to reduce cocaine smuggling. this legislation would add a new. forceful weapon to our nations arsenal in the war on illegal drug smuggling. it calls on the president of the united states to cut off all ecoic assistance to the government of bolivia. unless it eradicates at least 10 percent of its huge coca cropone of the worlds principal sources of cocaine. in recent years. the burgeoning growth of cocaine importation and use in the united states has become a problem of immense. farreaching proportions. its insidious effects pose a menace to the health of millions of americans: experts estimate that every day 5.000 americans use cocaine for the first time. many of these will become addicts. destroying their physical and mental health and turning their family lives into nightmares. the horror stories of cocaine use have become distressingly familiar to us. lately the cocaine trade itself has raised a new threat: u.s. drug enforcement officials fighting to cut off the cocaine pipeline from latin america have become the targets and. in one case. the victims of the ruthless cocaine syndicates. as one recent magazine article stated. the "evil empire" of cocaine trafficking "grows like a poisos weed."  is the time to uproot the cocaine problem at its soruce. and bolivia is the logical place to focus our attention and efforts. according to the state departments international narcotics control strategy report issued last month. the bolivian government has the worlds worst record of fighting drug production. bolivias vast coca fields produce crashcrop profits of almost $2 billion per year. three times the value of the nations entire legal exports. bolivia is  the source of more than 50 percent of the worlds cocaine. and the coca fields are growing larger. our efforts to work with bolivia to reduce coca production began 2 years ago. when there was government coca reduction program in operation. kn reduction of coca cultivation. and apparent government intention to address the problem. in august 1983 the united states and bolivia signed four project agreements. which provided u.s. assistance to a narcotics control program in the chapare region. where the coca production is concentrated. as this effort to reduce the coca crop began. the u.s. agency for international development signed a complementary agreement to provide development assistance to the same area. a police strike force was formed in october 1983 and began receiving field equipment from the united states in december. those initiatives. committing u.s. funds and materiel to the war on the illegal drug trade. have had success. due largely to lack of cooperation on the part of bolivian authorities. last january. president reagan warned bolivia that if it did  begin reducing coca production. the united states might cut off the $58 million in u.s. funds set aside for coca eradiction and accompanying rural development. this warning was largely iged. perfunctory police raids on coca marketplaces have taken place. but  a single coca bush has been destroyed. growing and selling the coca leaf remains  only a legal business in bolivia. but a thriving one. the bill we are introducing today would force bolivian authorities to join our efforts to combat cocaine growth and trafficking. or face the loss of all u.s. ecoic assistance. during fiscal year 1984. this amounted to more than $37 million. under this legislation. beginning in fiscal year 1986 u.s. assistanceexcept for food and medical supplieswill go to bolivia unless the president certifies to congress that the amount of coca produced in bolivia during the preceding fiscal year is at least 10 percent less than the amount produced in bolivia during the year before. this proposal follows upon the diplomacy against drugs act. which passed the senate by a vote of 96 to 0 and became law in 1983. that measure directs the president to terminate all aid to major drugproducing nations which fail to cooperate with u.s. narcotics control efforts. we must continue to employ education. law enforcement. and diplomatic negotiation to battle the cocaine problem. but bolivias lack of cooperation in this area compels a strong response by our government. this bill aims to cutoff cocaine trafficking at its source. it is imperative for us to act  in order to stem the flow of this dangerous drug into our country. and reduce the number of americans who tragically become cocaine addicts every day. in addition. this action will aid those charged with the difficult task of fighting the drug traffickers who pour tons of this poison across our southern border each year. i hope the senate can consider this important measure in the near future. and i urge my colleagues to join in supporting this effort.e by mr. damato (for himself and mr. mattingly):
