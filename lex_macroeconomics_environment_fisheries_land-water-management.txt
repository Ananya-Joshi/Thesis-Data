. this legislation has the support of conservatives and liberals. and democrats and republicans alike. by aiding development of coastal barriers. the federal government is presently diminishing the productivity of estuaries and wetlands in terms of fish and wildlife resources. increasing risks to life and property. reducing the capacity of such areas to protect the mainland from storms. and reducing public access to valuable beach recrear tion areas. storms and other natural processes inevitably undermine the attempt to stablize and develop these areas. federal investments are lost and. under current practice. replaced with new federal investment in a continuing cycle of wasted federal funds. by enacting their legislation we will be signalling a change in federal spending policy where the conservation of important natural resources come into play. this is because the legislation recognizes that federal expenditures which subsidize and thereby encourage development on coastal barriers constitute a concise federal investment from both a natural resource and ecoic standpoint. this bill is an intelligent approach to conserving our remaining undeveloped coastal barriers. i urge my colleagues to give it their full support.
