 on all matters affecting development assistance. in addition. the administrator will be responsible for u.s. policy with respect to the world bank group and regional development banks. such coordination will improve and make more coherent overall u.s. development policy. this act recognizes that important ecoic and techogical changes have made for an interdependent world. to which the governmental as well as private channels of assistance are relevant. the act also consolidates programs aimed primarily at middle income developing countries which longer need concessional assistance if they can gain sufficient access to private capital markets. investment and technical expertise. among these programs is the overseas private investment corporation which i am very hopeful will soon have its authority so that it can get back to the business of providing political and war risk insurance for u.s. investments abroad. i support the general thrust of this act and when it becomes law it will be a living memorial to our late colleague. senator humphrey of minnesota.
