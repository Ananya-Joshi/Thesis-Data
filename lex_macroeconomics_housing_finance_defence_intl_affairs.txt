. i invite the attention of the senate to the development of a company called the atlantic community development group. of which i had the ho to be the inspirer originally. as chairman of the ecoic committee of the nato parliamentarians conference. in the early 1960s. this has become a massive private enterprise effort of mutualization. a consortium of the greatest companies and banks in the industrial world at this time. to assist in the development of latin america. but the idea is being extended to asia. where a company already has been organized. and one is in prospect in africa and one will ultimately come in the middle east. the success of this enterprise is so critically important as bearing on .the validity of the enterprise system as a technique for world development. quite apart from governments. that i commend this study to my colleagues. incidentally. the overseas private investment corporation. which we will organize soon. which has already been authorized by law. though a government entity. follows the same general idea of stimulating this kind of world activity. it has tremendous consequences in relieving us of budget strain and other disadvantages of the kind of foreign aid we have been carrying on for years. which can be displaced. but a good deal of whose work might be done in this way. i ask unanimous consent that an article on the development of this company. published in the july 11. 1970. issue of business week. making reference to its very gifted executive director. ernst keller. be printed at this point in the record.
