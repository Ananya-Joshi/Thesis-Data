first i would like to discuss the amendment.  shall take all appropriate steps to assure to the maximum extent possible that u.s.owned excess foreign currencies are utilized in lieu of dollars. in addition. it is my conviction and i believe that of my colleague. the gentleman from wisconsin . who helped draft this amendment. and of the subcommittee chaired by the distinguished gentleman from california [. the utilization of excess foreign currencies under existing programs. and consistent with existing laws. can be helpful in terms of support for: schools abroad for dependent children of u.s. officers and employees. language instruction for our foreign service officers and other u.s. nationals serving overseas. the teaching of english as a second language. official travel for officers within their regional area of service. and for other purposes such as lease. rental. and acquisition of adequate housing facilities. in addition. aher key area of support includes international. educational. and cultural exchange activities. in my judgment it is important for the congress in this bill to take e of the accretion of these currencies. to encourage the executive to come forward to the appropriations committee with properly thought out requests for their use under existing programs so that these funds can be appropriately utilized and where possible. save dollars.
