where does it say that. we are talking about the supreme court.  inferior courts. i think. by virtue both of the constitution and by case law. it is clearly established that there is a final say. the senator ks what he is doing as well as i do. he is pushing comity to the point where something might have to give. god save us if it does. because then it is longer separate but equal. but clearly there has to be one final say insofar as the law is concerned and what the senator is  saying is that that is  a supreme court.
i continue: 1. because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth. "that religion or the duty which we owe to our creator and the manner of discharging it. can be directed only by reason and conviction.  by force or violence." the religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man. and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. this right is in its nature an unalienable right. it is unalienable. because the opinions of men. depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds. can follow the dictates of other men: it is unalienable also. because what is here a right towards men. is a duty towards the creator. it is the duty of every man to render to the creator such homage. and such only. as he believes to be acceptable to him. and "him" is with a small and  a capital "h"this duty is precedent both in order of time and degree of obligation. to the claims of civil society. before any man can be considered as a member of civil society. he must be considered as a subject of the gover of the universe: and if a member of civil society. who enters into any subordinate association. must always do it with a reservation of his duty to the general authority. much more must every man who becomes a member of any particular civil society. do it with a saving of his allegiance to the universal sovereign. we maintain therefore that in matters of religion. mans right is abridged by the institution of civil society. and that religion is wholly exempt from its eognizance. this is james madison in 1785. and here we are on the floor in 1982 trying to reject the very reasoning which gave birth to this nationtrue it is. that other rule exists. by which any question which may divide a society. can be ultimately determined. but the will of the majority. but it is also true. that the majority may trespass on the rights of the miity.  i realize that large portions of our populace who used to be in the miity have achieved majority status. if  in the nation as a whole. in their community. but i am  going to allow memories to be so short as to feel that once in the majority these principles that brought them to that point longer apply. the fact is that my faith. protestantism. was de facto the official religion of this nation up until a few years ago. and if you do  think so. ask those who used to try to run for office who were either of the catholic faith or of the jewish faith. a lot of barriers came tumbling down when men like abe ribicoff and john kennedy were elected. and this is within our lifetime.  there is hing unusual in the political sense to sit side by side. jew and catholic with protestant. but for years because protestantism was de facto the religion of this nation. miities were discriminated against. i should yearn for those kinds of good old days. they were never contemplated by the founders of this country. and i am  about ready to give them life today. a one point or aher all of us have been in a miity status in this nation. it is because the miity is  given any additional powers under the constitution that we enjoy our life in this country either in the miity or in the majority capacity. and it is why many of us who were in the miity  have achieved some sort of majority status. 2. because of religion be exempt from the authority of the society at large. still less can it be subject to that of the legislative body. the latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the former. their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited: it is limited with regard to the coordinate departments. more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. the rulers who are guilty or such an encroachment. exceed the commission from which they derive their authority. and are tyrants. the people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves.  by an authority derived from them. and are slaves. 3. because. it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. we hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens. and one of [the] lest characteristics of the late revolution. the freemen of america did  wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise. and entangled the question in precedents. what a great line: "the free men of america did  wait until usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in precedents."they saw all the consequences in the principle. and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. we revere this lesson too much. soon to forget it. the matter of principle. the very constitutional principle at stake here. which started off this whole business of intrusion into the personal. the individual constitutional freedom that we all enjoy. is this: if the senate of the united states as a matter of principle can tell the courts what to do. then who is safe from the politics of this body. madison refers to christians. saying if you establish christianity as the state religion who then will stop somebody from coming along and saying that this particular sect of christianity shall dominate. if you intrude upon the rights of black schoolchildren. then why  intrude upon the rights of the elderly. the businessman. the union men. the retarded. and the disabled. free men of america did  wait until usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in precedents. they saw all the consequences in the principle. some of us out here are seeing all the consequences in the principle. and all the consequences of what is being proposed here means a state religion and a state prayer. . if we are willing to go ahead and accept that. so be it. but this is  some little inuous exercise that only relates to a few children bowing their heads and avowing some inuous words. they saw all the consequences in the principle. and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. we revere this lession too much. soon to forget it. this was written in 1785. well. maybe the problem right  is it is 1982. some 200 years later. and maybe it is that we have forgotten. and the object of this exrcise on the floor is  to allow that forgetting to take place. i stated earlier that i underste.nd the political consequences of what i am doing out here. everybody sitys. "oh. lets have a little prayer in school." well. maybe if we had all fought and died and been pursued and hunted on the matter of our religion as these men and women were. we would  consider this such a mi matter. if we could transport ourselves back to 1785 and live with those fears that in effect had founded a nation. we would  look upon this as some harmless little exercise to bring a little morality into the mainstream of america. they saw all the consequences in the principle. and they avoided the consequences by -denying the principle. we revere this lesson too much. soon to forget it. who does  see that the same authority which can establish christianity. in exclusion of all other religions. may establish with the same ease any particular sect of christians. in exclusion of all other sects. that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment. may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever. 4. because. the bill violates that equality which ought to be the baski of every law. and which is more indispenible. in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be impeached. if "all men are by nature equally free and independent." all men are to be considered as entering into society on equal. conditions: as relinquishing more. and therefore retaining less. one than aher. of their natural rights. above all are they to be considered as retaining an "equal title to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience." whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace. to profess and to observe the religion which we believe to be of divine origin if this freedom be abused. it is an offence against god.  against man. to god. therefore.  to men. must an account of it be rendered.  maybe we get an understanding. i might add. why this constitution has lasted for so long. what a mind. what a mind to put the constitution together which has had to last over the centuries. but  you understand the background. as you listen to this letter written by madison. with a full understanding of their experience and what it is they desired for this nation. indeed. if the constitution is valid. if it is valid. if it is to withstand the test of time. then who is to say. as is alluded to in madisons statement. that the true faith is even here. it might  even be here. it might be e of the religions that any of us belong to or any of us profess or believe in. yet it may be proclaimed the true faith. i do  k. but i k when that individual comes along or that faith is among us. it should have the same chance to be explained and to grow as those of the accepted faiths today. whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace. to profess and to observe the religion which we believe to be of divine origin if this freedom be abused. it is an offence against god.  against man. to god. therefore.  to men. must an account of it be rendered. the business of this floor or this senate is the business of man. the business of god is in the pulpits and the places of worship across this nation. let them present their evidence to convince. to bring into the fold. to make believers. that is their job. my job on this floor is to make certain that wherever that takes place it can be done in total freedom. and if you merge. if you merge my job with the priests or the ministers or the rabbis job. then. indeed. you have an abomination and a dilution of both ideals. as the bill violates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens. so it violates the same principle. by granting to others peculiar exemptions. are the quakers and meists the only sects who think a compulsive support of their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable. can their piety alone be intrusted with the care of public worship. ought their religions to be endowed above all others. with extraordinary privileges. by which proselytes may be enticed from all others. we think too favorably of the justice and good sense of these deinations. to believe that they either covet preeminencies over their fellow citizens. or that they will be seduced by them. from the common opposition to the measure. 5. because the bill implies either that the civil magistrate is a competent judge of religious truth. or that he may employ religion as an engine of civil policy. "a competent judge of religious truth." i love it. that is what we are trying to do out here. collectively be a competent judge of religious truth. and i am the first to admit i am totally incompetent of that task and i was  elected to that task. the judge of religious truth under our constitution is each one of us. i feel safe with that principle well established. each one of us. each 1 of 300 million americans is the judge of religious truth.  one senator.  100 senators.  435 congressmen.  a president of the united states. but each one of us. the best phrase. i suppose. from the sermon from the mount. as i understand it in my particular faith is where even the god which i worship. or more particularly the son which i worship. says. "and when you go into your room to pray. go and shut the door and pray to your father in secret because he ks what is in your heart." each citizen of his country. to use madisons words. "being a competent judge of religious truth." the first is an arrogant pretension falsified by the contradictory opinions of rules in all ages. and throughout the world: the second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation. 6. because the establisment proposed by the bill is  requisite for the support of the christian religion. to say that it is. is a contradiction to the christian religion itself. for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world: it is a contradiction of fact. for it is kn that this religion both existed and flourished.  only without the support of human laws. but in spite of every opposition from them. period of miraculous aid. but long after and  only during the period of miraculous aid. but long after it had been left to its own evidence. and the ordinary care of providence: nay. it is a contradiction in terms. for a religion  invented by human policy. must have preexisted and been supported. before it was established by human policy. it is moreover to weaken in those who profess this religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence. and the patronage of its author. and to foster in those who still reject it. a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies. to trust it to its own merits. 7. because experience witnesseth tha. ecclesiastical establishments. instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion. have had a contrary operation. during almost fifteen centuries. has the legal establishment of christianity been on trial. what have been its fruits. more or less in all places. pride and indolence in the clergy. igance and servility in the laity. in both superstition. bigotry. and persecution. enquire of the teachers of christianity for the ages in which it appeared in its greatest listre. those of every sect. point to the ages prior to its incorporation with civil policy. propose a restoration of this primitive state in which its teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks. many of them predict its downfall. on which side ought their testimony to hava greatest weight. when for or when against their interest. 8. because the establishment in question is  necessary for the support of civil government. if it be urged as necessary for the support of civil government only as it is a means of supporting religion. and it be  necessary for the latter purpose. it can be necessary for the former. if religion be  within [the] cognizance of civil government. how can its legal establishment be said to be necessary to civil overnment. what influence in fact have ecclejiastical establishments had on civil society. in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of civil authority. in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny. in instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty. may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries. a just government. instituted to secure & perpetuate it. needs them . such a government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property: by neither invading the equal rights of any sect.  suffering any sect to invade those of aher. 9. becare the proposed establishment is a departure from that generous policy. which. offering an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every nation and religion. promis& d a lustre to our country. and an accession to the number of its citizens. what a melancholy mark is the bill of sudden degeneracy. instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted. it is itself a signal of persecution. a signal of persecution. that is exactly what this bill is. persecution in the sense of trying to impose a state religion. a state religion in this particular instance to be determined by the senate of the united states. i can tell you of the apprehension that i felt when i read in the newspapers that the president was going to propose a contitutional amendment on prayer. and indeed some of the stories said that it would actually have the words to be used in that prayer. i do  want anybody writing any prayers or instructing anybody that they should pray.  the president.  a senator.  a congressman.  a gover.  a local school official. ody. that s completely separate and apart as to whether or  i believe and hope and urge that we be a religious people. if this congress could pass a law on prayer. if this congress in conjunction with the president and school boards can determine what that prayer is to be. what is the situation to be 20 years from . what can you guarantee me will be the situation in 100 years. we were given total freedom. up to this point we have total freedom. it took years to arrive even at that point. but finally we understood our own constitution. and the courts and the legislatures have agreed that total freedom was to be preferred. . why should i wish something less for my children. you can guarantee me what the words will be. as long as i stick to the constitution and say words. then i have acquitted myself of my trust to the people of this nation that they can say or do whatever they want in terms of their religion. but the first time that a law is passed and prayer is dictated. and even the substance of the prayer is set down. then what this congress can do aher congress and aher president can do better. there is end to that mischief. the fact is it can start. once started. there is stopping it. the greatest mischief in the world has been performed in the name and the cause of religion. we had a little bit of an experiment here in this country with it. i am saying in its x aghest stages. we had a few witch trials. we managed to get over that hump. but we have lived for hundreds of years with very cruel discrimination against our fellow americans based on religion. i me n physical cruelty.  just mental. those of my colleagues who are of the mormon faith can attest to that. those of the jewish faith can attest to that. it degrades from the equal rank of citizens au those whose opinions in religion do  bend to those of the legislative authority. distant as it may be. in its present form from the inquisition it differs from it only in degree. this is james madison. this is  some liberal republican or screaming liberal democrat or somebody from the left wing. this is one of the authors of the constitution talking in 1785. speaking so clearly. right on target. as to what is before us. it degrades from the equal rank of citizens all those whose opinions in religion do  bend to those of the legislative authorlty. distant as it may be. in its present form. from the inquisition it differs from it only in degree. "what is being proposed here differs only in degree from the inquisition"again back to that matter of principle. "the one is the first step. the other the last in the career of intolerance." "the one is the first step. the other the last"-you see. . that was written by a great american. one of our founders. written by a deeply religious man. and every single warning. every urgent declaration against the danger expressed here applies to what is on this senate floor right . i do  care what the percentages of the polls are relative to the matter of prayer. it is the duty of every american to protect the liberties under the constitution of the united states that are guaranteed to all of us. the fact is that that document must stand for all time: to serve all faiths. existent or in the future. and to make sure that there can be the fullest exercise of anyones beliefs. this proposition on the floor of the u.s. senate today is. in principle. as dangerous as any act of intolerance that has occurred in the history of man or in the history of this nation. it is. as the author puts it. step one in the career of intolerance. mark twain wrote in his book. "a connecticut yankee in king duthurs court." chapter  10. a passage i am  going to read. i had started a teacher factory and a lot of sunday schools the first thing. as a result. i  had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places. and also a complete variety of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition. everybody could be any kind of a christian he wanted to. there was perfect freedom in that matter. but i confined public religious teaching to the churches and the sunday schools. permitting hing of it in my other educational buildings. i could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian without any trouble. but that would have been to affront a law of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites. complexions. and features. and a man is only at his best. morally. when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual cormiflexion. angularities. and stature of the irdividual who wears it: and besides i was afraid of a united church. it makes a mighty power. the mightiest conceivable. and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands. as it is always bound to do. it means death to human liberty. and paralysis to human thought. why does this congress choose to ige history. indeed. to defy it. are we certain. in other words. that we are going to be able to do the right thing. that we have a better idea than the constitution of the united states. do we want to tinker around with thi matter of religion. thomas jefferson. in a letter written january 1. 1802. to a committee of the danbury baptist association in my state of connecticut. said: the affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me. on behalf of the danbury baptist association. give me the high. est satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents. and in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties. the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing. believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god. that he owes account to e other for his faith or his worship. that the legislauve powers of government reach actions only. and  opinions. i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should "make law respecting an establishment ofreligion. or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." thus building a wall of separation between church and state. adhering to thi& expression of the supreme will of the nation on behalf of the rights of conscience. i shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those senti. ments which tend to restore to man till his natural rights. zonvinced he has natural right in opposition to his social duties. i reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection add blessing of the common father and creator of man. and tender you for yourselves and your regislous assoclation. assurances of my high respect and esteem. so again. we have the exact same expression as we encountered in the letters from james madison.
senator. if indeed what was the teachers role. advocates somebody is violating the law by deny- of the parental position said that it ing to a ciild the right to stand up and was really a voluntary prayer. howevsay a prayer. then that person is clear- er. it is difficult to see how a 5yearold ly in violation of the law as it  child could engage in voluntary stands. prayer. what is sought by this amendment it appears that all the children recitis a group activity. is an organized ac- ed the same prayer under. the directivity. tion of the teacher. somebody said to me. "well. it will that is  an individual standing only be for 90 seconds." as if this were up and reciting their own prayer or some sort of a numbers game. i do  their own feelings. care if it is 1 second. 00 seconds. or 1 again. i repeat. the problem is there minute. the principle is large and the is case where any individual has principle is that today all of us enjoy been denied the right to pray. and total religious freedom. the ability to there is situation where an individfind our own way to god. ual can be denied that right and  it is said. "well. obviously the same be subject to the laws of this nation. rules dn  apply to children as apply what is sought to be achieved. and i to adults." that is  the way the ripeat. is  just prayer on the part constitution of the united states is of the individual. but rather. organized written. the constitution does  ad- prayer. this is where the bone of condress the matter of age. we are all the tention lies. same in the eyes of that document. and it is stated in the revised and in the sight of that document. we amendment. let me get a copy of the have the right today to pray any- new amendment. which might add. where. any time. in any manner that come so thick and fast it is hard to we see fit. keep up with them. and it troubles me . if there are those instances to k the constitution of the where that right is being denied. then. united states is going to be altered as i have said earlier. i would be the with amendments that are devised in a first to instigate the legal action to re- half hours time and then brought to store to that individual his or her the floor. rights. the amendment  reads: "(1) hing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual. group vocal or silent prayer in public schools or other public institutions. person shall be re. quiredby the t nited states or by any state to participate an prayer. neither the united states  any state shall compose or man date the words of any prayer to be said in public schools. (2) the authorization by the united states or any state of equal access to the use of public facilities by voluntary religious groups shall  constitute an establishment of religion." again. the difficulty lies in the matter of the form of the prayer. i find. insofar as my children are concernedand i have children that range 4. 5. 18. 22. 24is that i do  want my children to be taught any inuous prayer. i do  want them to pray in silence. i like my good friend from vermont. very definitely believe in the role of religion within the family. i want my children to pray out loud and in the manner in which my family participates in our chosen religion. so here in this amendment. which might be inuous to the secular activity of our nation. which is governmental and political. is extremely objectionable when taken in an ecclesiastical sense. maybe you can satisfy yourselves as to what is good from a political point of view. but you can satisfy my religious beliefs. that is why the framers of the constitution kept these two matters apart. do you want to k what happens when the government gets into religion and trying to interpret religion. well. there was great joy among many of the proponents of this amendment when the supreme court handed down its decision in the pawtucket case relative to the creche being displayed in that city. but i would suggest to my friends on the other side of this issue. you better read that decision and see what it says. if you happen to be a christian. i think you will find it very objectionable. why very objectionable. do you k why the display is permitted by the supreme court. let me read some of the language and see how it makes a christian feel. we are satisfled this is the majority opinion. that the city has a secular purpose for including a crtche. that the city has  impermissibly advanced religion. and that including the crcche does  create excessive entanglement between religion and government. even the traditional. purely secular displays extant at christmas. with or without a creche. would inevitably recall the religious nature of the holiday. the display engenders a friendly community spirit of good will in keeping with the season. the creche may well have special meaning to those whose faith includes the celebration of religious masses. but e who sense the origins of the christmas celebration would fall to be aware of its religious implilcations. that the display brings people into the central city. and serves commercial interests and benefits merchants and their employees. does . as the dissent points out. determine the character of the display. so the display is allowed  on religious grounds. but because it is a secular exhibit. this case is the ultimate judicial determination as to the commercialization of christmas. that should make everybody feel good. it is a commercial event. it is tradition. the court likened it to an art display. that really makes me wonder. the focal point of my religion is allowed to take place because it is a commercial event. it is like an art display. that is  what i am going to teach my children. that. is the reason why government should  be in this business of religion. there is hing you can do in order to make prayer inuous that will satisfy the requirements that i impose on myself and my children. indeed. the more inuous and the more politically acceptable in the secular sense. the more objectionable from a religious point of view. it was well stated by someone other than myself that by the time we are through with all this we are going to have a "to whom it may concern" prayer. that is what is being fashioned in the majority leaders office. a prayer broad egh. so that if it is a "to whom it may concern" prayer we will get egh votes to pass it on the floor of the u.s. senate. ask yourself the question again and again during the debate. where is it today that someone can stand up and pray in their own way to their own god. as an individual. the answer is place. as soon as this amendment is passed. then that ultimate and that total freedom will be something less because at that stage of the game there will be a time when you can do it only in a way that is permissible to the government.
i will be glad to debate with the senator from th carolina any time. the fact is that in1980 or whenever this language was first put on. it was inuous. ody dreamed that the issue would arrive in the proportions which we see today in this nation. ody dreamed of that. it was inuous language. harm could come of it. there were those who thought there was a problem here. constitutionally. it was  until the political season and with those running for the highest office in the land that finally the issue manifested itself in terms of personalities. all of a sudden the whole country became involved with it. so as it is presented on the senate floor in the year 1984. more specifically in september 1984. 1 2 months before an election. it is longer inuous. because it has tremendous implications and ramifications due to the debate that is the background of what is being proposed here on the floor. programs. programs. it seems to me as soon as you have programs of prayer. voluntary or otherwise. you are in violation of the first amendment of the constitution of the united states. i might add. so that ody feels we are blind on this issue. i have a seconddegree amendment waiting here which specifically would eliminate those words that say "the implementation of programs of" and insert "individual." so that in effect it would read: "funds appropriated under this act may be used to prevent individual prayer and meditation in the public schools." that is unacceptable. but that does  violate the constitution. all it. does is restate the law as it is. but there is violation. everybody. prayndeed. the government should  use its funds to prevent any person. anyl individual. from praying.  with the word "program" in this amend ent. there you are with organized prayer in the school. do i want to see a. years work go down the drain.  but this issue. too. is important. the shame of putting it on this bill.  1. that is  my shame. i have just sent word to the appropriations committee which is reviewing the continuing resolution to incorporate all that has been done so far by ithe committee and by the senate into the continuing resolution. i realize it will probably be postponed a day or two because probably the same group will try to put a prayer amendment on the continuing resolution. and i will have to fight that. i suppose what bothers me the most. as it does everybody else. is that the people who will suffer are  the ones who can afford to suffer in this country. but that was  my choice. i did  pose the issue. and. yes. there is something very special and just as valuable to each one of us as human beings in the concepts of the constitution of the united states. it is  an antibiotic. it is  a teachers lesson. it is  a roof over your head. it is  a job. but it is also important. too many people in this country have glossed over it for too long. and that is why we are in our present straits. so if the problem does have to be dramatized. let. it be dramatized. and on this bill. let us understand what it is that is going to be lost and who is going to suffer for this political dialog. for this philosophica) dialog. i can believe that anybody in igance or homeless or in suffering is going to be very appreciative of the senate of the united states or their government. as much as i believe in the value of prayer. and i do. there is better example. insofar as doing that which is caesars businessthat is the business of this body. the business of government. the secular business of (he united states. that is our job. i am  here. and neither are any of my colleagues. to take up on the senate floor on tuesday aftern what the rabbi or the priest did  do on saturday or sunday. that is their job. so i would hope that we could get on to the business of the legislation before us and the senate bill. which is so far superior. thanks to all of you in this chamber. so far superior to what it is the ho use has devised. but let us address oursolves to our responsibility in this area. that.. believe me. is the proper business.  the amendment before us. i have desirelet me put it this wayto get into the long constitutional debates. we have been all through this. ad nauseam. it is a big issue out there. i am sure there are those on both sides of the airle who would love to sticli their opponents with voting against this amendment in an elect ion year. "you voted against prayers in school." it will work both ways. wait and see. that is maybe what someone wants to achieve out here. a political end to embarrass somebody else. let me say it loud and clear.  for the purpose of the members of this body. as they k the constitution as well as i do. but to remind the american people of article 6. religious testreligious testshall be required for the holding of office. so regardless of how anybody votes on this amendment.. disregard it. indeed. if anybody does try to embarrass anyone else. they are the ones who should be voted out of office for ongaging in that kind of demagogery. if there are those who want this for political purposes. all the more reason why the vote should take place. i might add i do  want to hear it said of the senator from connect icut. "you are  running for election. so you do  care." i was running for septemzber 25. 1984 election in 1982 and i took the same position in 1982 that i am taking . i think the time has come to kk it off. this whole religious debate has gone way beyond its bounds. as it always does. the political parties. the political arena. the senate of the united states are different from our own homes and our own social gatherings. these are conversations best left alone. it is up to each one of us in the united states of america to find our own way to the creator. we do  need any help from government. we do  need any programs of prayer in schools. we do  need any u.s. senators or candidates moralizing for the rest of the nation. i k. thanks to the decisions of the supreme court. that my children are far more tolerant religiously and racially than i or my generation were. that is what counts in the united states of america. that is progress.  i do  yearn for the good old days when you knew exactly who was who in your class and whom they worshiped or why. i do  yearn for that at all.  for the embarrassment caused by those who were  protestant. because most of the prayers were protestant. i do  1.arn for that at all. i am so proud of where we are today and where our children are. they judge each other on the basis of the worth that is inside.  on the basis of the institution one belongs to or the color of the skin. that is where the constitution works where. indeed. many of our faiths have failed i am  here to get into a preaching dialog this aftern. i k that what is embodied in this bill best exemplifies everything i was taught in my particular faith and i k that it can come to pass if this bill is passed. and it will  if it does . talk to me about what it is that we believe in. what it is that is espoused by whatever faith we belong toprinciples of belief of all religions in this nation that have been furthered by exactly what this government does and what. more particularly. it does in this bill. i could  necessarily say the same thing for the dod bill and other bills. this bill is the manifestation. in my particular instance. of what i believe in insofar as my fellow man is concerned. as i said. the weakness of this cause is best exemplified by piggybacking this proposition on this legislation. on the backs of these people. and on the fulfillment or fulfillment of their lives. so. . i suggest the absence of a quorum.
senator. if indeed what was the teachers role. advocates somebody is violating the law by deny- of the parental position said that it ing to a ciild the right to stand up and was really a voluntary prayer. howevsay a prayer. then that person is clear- er. it is difficult to see how a 5yearold ly in violation of the law as it  child could engage in voluntary stands. prayer. what is sought by this amendment it appears that all the children recitis a group activity. is an organized ac- ed the same prayer under. the directivity. tion of the teacher. somebody said to me. "well. it will that is  an individual standing only be for 90 seconds." as if this were up and reciting their own prayer or some sort of a numbers game. i do  their own feelings. care if it is 1 second. 00 seconds. or 1 again. i repeat. the problem is there minute. the principle is large and the is case where any individual has principle is that today all of us enjoy been denied the right to pray. and total religious freedom. the ability to there is situation where an individfind our own way to god. ual can be denied that right and  it is said. "well. obviously the same be subject to the laws of this nation. rules dn  apply to children as apply what is sought to be achieved. and i to adults." that is  the way the ripeat. is  just prayer on the part constitution of the united states is of the individual. but rather. organized written. the constitution does  ad- prayer. this is where the bone of condress the matter of age. we are all the tention lies. same in the eyes of that document. and it is stated in the revised and in the sight of that document. we amendment. let me get a copy of the have the right today to pray any- new amendment. which might add. where. any time. in any manner that come so thick and fast it is hard to we see fit. keep up with them. and it troubles me . if there are those instances to k the constitution of the where that right is being denied. then. united states is going to be altered as i have said earlier. i would be the with amendments that are devised in a first to instigate the legal action to re- half hours time and then brought to store to that individual his or her the floor. rights. the amendment  reads: "(1) hing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual. group vocal or silent prayer in public schools or other public institutions. person shall be re. quiredby the t nited states or by any state to participate an prayer. neither the united states  any state shall compose or man date the words of any prayer to be said in public schools. (2) the authorization by the united states or any state of equal access to the use of public facilities by voluntary religious groups shall  constitute an establishment of religion." again. the difficulty lies in the matter of the form of the prayer. i find. insofar as my children are concernedand i have children that range 4. 5. 18. 22. 24is that i do  want my children to be taught any inuous prayer. i do  want them to pray in silence. i like my good friend from vermont. very definitely believe in the role of religion within the family. i want my children to pray out loud and in the manner in which my family participates in our chosen religion. so here in this amendment. which might be inuous to the secular activity of our nation. which is governmental and political. is extremely objectionable when taken in an ecclesiastical sense. maybe you can satisfy yourselves as to what is good from a political point of view. but you can satisfy my religious beliefs. that is why the framers of the constitution kept these two matters apart. do you want to k what happens when the government gets into religion and trying to interpret religion. well. there was great joy among many of the proponents of this amendment when the supreme court handed down its decision in the pawtucket case relative to the creche being displayed in that city. but i would suggest to my friends on the other side of this issue. you better read that decision and see what it says. if you happen to be a christian. i think you will find it very objectionable. why very objectionable. do you k why the display is permitted by the supreme court. let me read some of the language and see how it makes a christian feel. we are satisfled this is the majority opinion. that the city has a secular purpose for including a crtche. that the city has  impermissibly advanced religion. and that including the crcche does  create excessive entanglement between religion and government. even the traditional. purely secular displays extant at christmas. with or without a creche. would inevitably recall the religious nature of the holiday. the display engenders a friendly community spirit of good will in keeping with the season. the creche may well have special meaning to those whose faith includes the celebration of religious masses. but e who sense the origins of the christmas celebration would fall to be aware of its religious implilcations. that the display brings people into the central city. and serves commercial interests and benefits merchants and their employees. does . as the dissent points out. determine the character of the display. so the display is allowed  on religious grounds. but because it is a secular exhibit. this case is the ultimate judicial determination as to the commercialization of christmas. that should make everybody feel good. it is a commercial event. it is tradition. the court likened it to an art display. that really makes me wonder. the focal point of my religion is allowed to take place because it is a commercial event. it is like an art display. that is  what i am going to teach my children. that. is the reason why government should  be in this business of religion. there is hing you can do in order to make prayer inuous that will satisfy the requirements that i impose on myself and my children. indeed. the more inuous and the more politically acceptable in the secular sense. the more objectionable from a religious point of view. it was well stated by someone other than myself that by the time we are through with all this we are going to have a "to whom it may concern" prayer. that is what is being fashioned in the majority leaders office. a prayer broad egh. so that if it is a "to whom it may concern" prayer we will get egh votes to pass it on the floor of the u.s. senate. ask yourself the question again and again during the debate. where is it today that someone can stand up and pray in their own way to their own god. as an individual. the answer is place. as soon as this amendment is passed. then that ultimate and that total freedom will be something less because at that stage of the game there will be a time when you can do it only in a way that is permissible to the government.

that is a reduction. the gentleman will e. of well over 50 percent from what it was a year ago. i may say to the gentleman. and i think it is something the house should k. that the constitution of the state of israel states that any jew anywhere in the world who wants to come to israel may do so. that isa most unusual constitutional provision. they are absorbing jewish immigrants at the rate of 30.000 a month. a very extraordinary record.
