. in following this weeks debate over the freeman farm bill. i have occasionally blushed with vicarious embarrassment for my good colleagues on the other side of the aisle who represent rural districts. they are called upon. to use the most polite term. to defend an astounding piece of legislative effrontery which i can believe they really believe in. . if polls and letters and press reports are to be credited. that their rural constituents want. the freeman farm bill has been correctly branded as a bill written by city slickers. sidewalk farmers. coming. as i do. from a highly urban district. i do  pose as any sort of agricultural expert. i can even aspire to the dubious title of "sidewalk farmer." but i do k the meaning of individual liberty. and i see how this legislation would erode the freedom of our industrious fellow citizens whose endeavors keep us the bestfed. bestclothed people in the world. in the last administration. usda policies were kn as the benson farm program. it is ironic that the measure before us today. if enacted. with all its ironclad controls over the individual enterprise of the farmer. will be kn as the freeman farm program. there is little in the freeman bill for freemen. it says to the american farmer: "become one of orvilles organization men or he will unleash the mighty wrath of the department of agriculture. flood the market and wipe you out." the referendum in this bill is a travesty. as an urbanite. representing urbanites. i am resentful of the fact that the secretary of agriculture wants to dip his hand into the market baskets of my constituents who are already struggling to meet todays record grocery bills. his proposals would skyrocket the costs of meat. grain. and dairy products. over and over again we republicans have warned that the freeman grain plan is a bread tax. together with the freeman dairy proposal. we would have a meat. milk. butter. egg. and bread tax. housewives shopping markets right across the nation would be pulled up short by freeman prices on nearly every staple they must buy to rish their families. as an urbanite. i can recognize. too. the tremendous new drain that freeman subsidies would place on the treasury. i shudder at the cost of the numberless new bureaucrats the freeman farm plan would compel to be hired to police its complex regulations. so. secretary freeman. hands off. hands off the industry and enterprise of our farmers. hands off the housewives market baskets. hands off the taxpayers.
director. corporation audits division. general accounting office. washington. d. c. dear mr. ives: last friday. march 25. 1949. i called to the attention of the senate that i had received reports from sources which i considered very reliable. that over $350.000.000 of receivables in the general commodities purchase program of the commodity credit corporation could  be supported or verified because of faulty accounting policies and poorly devised procedures. i stated further that in the case of certain other programs it was also impossible to support the recorded balances of receivables. particularly in the case of claims in the case of cotton loans held by the corporation. also. that it had made effort to prove the accuracy of the total amount of loans and it was therefore my understanding that the total amount of loans reported by the federal reserve banks. as custodians. could  be reconciled with the records of the corporation. i stated that at least one duplication of over $2.000.000 had been reported to me. i stated that it was my understanding that the wheat loans are overstated by about $4.000.000 with the corresponding overstatement in accounts payable. i went on to say that the book value of the inventories held by the corporation as of june 30. 1945. was in excess of $1.000.000.000. but that it had been reported to me that it was  possible to verify this amount physically. furthermore. i stated that an incident had been called to my attention where barley had been shipped to russia in the amount of $1.000.000. under the trading program. and the item had been omitted entirely from the sales. will you please advise me whether or  the information cited above is correct. sincerely yours.

. this question was fully debated when the issue was in the house on the resolution and a rollcall vote was taken on which i voted "nay." reference is made to the debate in the other body on the same resolution at pages 1051 to 1058 in the congressional record of february 1. 1954. the bill  comes back to us cut $65 million as a result of action in the other body and in conference. the bill represents a cancellation of losses on the high fixed farm price supports to the extent of $550 million as against $61 million of actually realized losses in the fiscal year 1953 in such operations. this should dispose once and for all of the allegations of small actual loss suffered in the program as the $550 million represents a realistic appraisal of the diminution in value of the over $4 billion of farm products held by the government as of june 30. 1953. these losses are accelerating rapidly and all that this bill has done is to give the commodity credit corporation aher over halfbillion dollars to stave off the day when it must ask congress for more credit authority. the bill to raise this credit authority to $8.500.000.000. it is said. will come before us shortly. it is vital that all who speak for consumersand this applies especially to those of us who represent big city areasshould oppose this constant drain of money and resources attributable to a highfixedfarmpriceparity program inimical alike to the interests of the consumer. the farmer and the national ecoy. one wants to embarrass our government. hence. the record once having been made on the original rollcall fight is being made on the conference report. but the expansion of credit which the commodity credit corporation is authorized to make available to support this program is a matter of policy and it is there that the interests of the consumer and the farmers who see their own best interests should be decisively manifested.
i did  say quite that. what i said was that in reading the debates in the other body. the estimates made by members from farm areas on the milk products stocks held by ccc. there were estimates there that the loss in such commodities held would be 50 percent or more.
s program is the flexible parity program. this represents the program of the administration in an effort to give balance to the farm price situation. it does  seem to me to be balanced when the united states government has $63 billion worth of surplus commodities piled up and when we have to look for ways and means of relieving the surplus which is costing $700.000 a day carrying charges alone. of course. it seems to me impossible to explain the virtue of the system. except that it must be changed when. at the same time. with a high. fixed parityprice guaranty. the farmers income has been going down. there is something wrong somewhere when the people in the cities are paying both prices at the highsupport levels and taxation for the purpose of making good on the fixed pricesupport program. something must be wrong somewhere. my colleagues say that the losses of the commodity credit corporation have been very small. we got to that a little while ago. when i interrogated the chairman of the committee on this very bill. sure. he said. we are providing that the congress appropriate all the money that the commodity credit corporation paid out for these commodities. regardless of what you have to sell them for in terms of the world market prices under this bill. in that way loss is shown for commodity credit corporation. though there is. in fact. a loss and the taxpayer is making it good. i assure you that if i could run a business the same way i would show loss whatever. as a matter of fact. it is surprising that any loss whatever is conceded. then the statement is made that we are still taking losses on the flexible parityprice program like the one on dairy products. that is  a tricky statement. because perhaps in dairy products even 75 percent of parity will continue to roll up surpluses and losses. if there be balance and some accommodation to the interests of city consumers and such compromise brings some losses. then they must be accepted. let us  forget that members from farm areas held the secretary of agriculture for years. and the whole price structure of the country in dairy products for years up to the 90 percent of parity level. despite the 1949 hopeaiken act and the vast and mounting surpluses. the high fixedparity price for dairy products was held up by successive secretaries of agriculture at the behest of the dairyproducts areas when these products were literally running out of our ears.
the senator from wisconsin and i are  far apart. but we are apart on this point: i would be for the presidents making the deal. if he thought it desirable. provided it would  be the beginning of new trade relations. but that it would be done for this one time under these conditions and in the national interest. as the senator from new york has said. we do  need gold that much. i agree. i do  care how pessimistic one may be about our gold stocks or our balance of payments. we have discussed that subject before. i agree with the senator. but it is also important to e that the russians do  need the wheat that much. they will get along without it. we have seen them do it before. if they can get along without it. they will buy it elsewhere. so i do  think this is the ball game.
the committee has reported the bill adversely. i should like to make it plain that the sponsors of the bill desire to include the amendment in the bill for reasons which only to them are sufficient and satisfactory. their attitude toward the bill demonstrates their intent. but it does  represent any expression by the senatewhatever may be the vote on the bill or the amendment--that the attorney generals opinion is  egh. standing alone. and that this provision must be placed in the bill. the legislative history is clear. as far as those of us who are against the bill are concerned. as far as the senate is concerned. if it votes down the bill. the attorney generals opinion is sufficient and adequate to enable banks to engage in the kind of shortterm commercial financing proposed for these grain sales. without fear of prosecution under the johnson act.
. press reports during the past several days indicate grave tensions within the european common market. some even suggesting that the european common market is in danger. the breakup of the european common market would be a major setback to the free worlds foreign policy even though we too have had our problems with the eec. it would possibly kill for the time the "kennedy round" of the worldwide trade talks under the general agreement on tariff and trade  scheduled for next year. the implications for our business community would be vast. the creation of the european ecoic community represents a culmination of a highly successful postwar effort of the atlantic community to rebuild western europe and to support forces pressing for european ecoic integration. the success of this effort has made western europe a new and major force in the world struggle for freedom. both in ecoic and political terms. any breakdown in the eec over the question of a common farm policy would represent a major weakening of free europe and weaken our common endeavor to expand world trade and to provide maximum ecoic assistance to the developing countries of the free world. u.s. trade and political partnership with a unified europe built around the common market must remain a keystone of our policy. i urge the administration to leave stone unturned in an effort to settle differences between the united states and the eec in the best longterm interests of both. and to use all its available resources. diplomatic. political. as well as ecoic to impress on all concerned that the necessity for western unity and ecoic strength overrides any differences they may have over farm policy. i ask unanimous consent that a series of articles. from the new york times and the wall street journal dealing with this subject be printed in the congressional record at the conclusion of my remarks.
. the achilles heel of price controls is being touched on by this amendment. the senator from connecticut and all of us k that if this amendment is carried. it is  going to become law as it is. it does  have provisions for correcting inequities. it does  have provisions for small factory farms. and it does  provide for many other things that would be necessary to control the prices of raw agricultural products. it does  relate to the problem of the senator from vermont of imports from abroad. ody is trying to put too much of a burden on the farmer. but the fact is that with the american markup system. we have an unregulated base as it goes through the market system to the places that are under control. that is the point  made here. that the control is basically ineffective. because the material fed into the system is  under control and is subject to all kinds of haphazard market forces. which is an emous problem. there are lots of farmers.  only in feed grains but farmers who raise chickens and farmers who milk cows. and they are suffering terribly. they are getting squeezed because feed grains are so idinately high and they can collect the money it takes at the other end. they could be benefited from controls. wisely administered. the main point. as i read the ribicoff amendmentand i shall support itis that it is really a declaration of the intention of congress that if we are going to have a system that will curb inflation through some form of price control. phases i. ii. or i. we have got to control agriculture at the source or it is meaningless. so as an expression of intent. i am sure that the senator from connecticut
