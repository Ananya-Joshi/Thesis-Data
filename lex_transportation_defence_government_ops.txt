. i get very nervous about congress getting into this business. it seems to me that. yes. we have had problems in the defense department. but i will never forget that when i was over there. the chief of naval operations once said to me. "when things go wrong. you dont always change the rules and regulations. sometimes you ought to change the people." i think there is a great danger in having every solesource contract. whether it is for aircraft or ship procurement or whatever. that is worked out in very complicated fashion and indeed quite frequently. as the senator ks. there is only one providerand that is true. for example. in the trident submarine and certain aircraftcome up for review by the congress. and. indeed. is it approval by the congress. if that is so. i think we are opening our way to all kinds of shenanigans and we get all kinds of political pressures: "oh.  the decisions are going to be made  by those who have the authority and who we have to trust. and if they are  good. lets fire them." but i think we are geting into heavy weather if we are sending it up here in this political maelstrom to consider who is going to get what contract. i urge my distinguished colleague to drop that particular vision or to modify it in some sense just to keep it out of this body.
