 on this matter. feeling very strongly.that we are a long way from out of the woods on energy. i predict. before this summer is over. there are going to be lines and there are going to be gasoline shortages and there are going to be price increases. i am tired of having that occur month after month. summer after summer. is it  interesting to e that within 24 hours after this import fee matter was rejected. or indicated to be rejected. both by the courts and by the house. the saudis raised their price $2 a barrel and ody in the congress raised a peep. well. i thank you very much. i might  like any form of taxation. but i would rather have the dollars going to the u.s. treasury than the treasury in riyadh. it would be my intention to oppose that matter should it be raised and also my intention to include the chrysler corp. in the ftc appropriation bill or. if need be. the debt ceiling extension legislation.
