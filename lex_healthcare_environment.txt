. the rivers and streams of the merrimack river basin have sufferd from pollution since the time of the great american naturalist. henry david thoreau. some 100 years ago. but in increasing amount and severity as the years have gone by. in 1966 i first proposed a demonstration project to clean up the merrimack river basin. based on the application of modern management techniques in the development of a comprehensive. coordinated pollution control program. a successful experience here would serve as an example of pollutioncontrol methods which could be applied to similar problems throughout the nation. and i am glad to be able to report that after renewing my proposal earlier this year. progress is  being made. techogy can  provide the means which are commensurate with the magnitude and complexity of the pollution problem. as a process which seeks efficiency as well as effectiveness. the new systems management techniques can also serve to ameliorate the financial difficulties that all levels of government are facing in their efforts to control pollution. as a multidisciplinary approach which can take into account political as well as techogical features of a problem. it can provide some answers to the various political problems which often work against the coordination required for a concerted attack on pollution. there is a vital factor in the battle against pollution. however. to which techogy is  so readily applicablethat of public concern and commitment. in the case of the merrimack there is a need to rally serious concern and a strong public demand for immediate action about a situation which has existed for over a century. many people have grown accustomed to its polluted condition or do  realize its severity or its threat as a dangerous health hazard. they have never been able to enjoy the benefits of a clean river. and thus in many instances have been unaware of its potential in terms of either "recreation or ecoic development for the region." in addition. the problem has grown so vast and complex that the action necessary to remedy it has seemed beyond their influence as individuals. there is. however. throughout this country. a growing concern with the quality of our environment. an increasing awareness that this deterioration has reached a critical point. and a widening demand for the opportunities that a clean river can provide. this is due in large part to the efforts. of concerned groups and dedicated individuals such as franz scholz. washington correspondent for the lowell sun. deeply disturbed by the lack of real progress in the merrimack. this young reporter undertook a lengthy study of its history in an attempt to understand the process and cause of its deterioration. he read henry david thoreaus "a week on the concord and merrimack rivers." as well as numerous state and federal studies that have been completed over the years on the merrimack pollution problem. impressed by thoreaus description of the former beauty of the area. and aware of the interest to be generated by comparing it with the present condition of the merrimack. he proposed a ca trip along these rivers and streams. following the same route as thoreau took. with the enthusiastic support of his emplbyers. franz scholz and photographerhelmsman richard taffe. jr.. cast off on august 16 to spend a week recreating thoreaus journey of 1839. his purpose was to observe with the aid of a panel of experts. the changes in the rivers and their environment since the days of thoreau. and he was joined on various days of the journey by dr. bela fabuss. director of the lowell techogical institute research foundation and author of a study on a pollution control program for the merrimack which will serve as the basis for the proposed demonstration project. and mr. arthur rowse. formerly executive director for the white house consumer bureau and  a national columnist and publisher of u.s. consumer. i was also pleased to be able to accompany him on the second day out for a firsthand and closeup view of the pollution problem. a special effort was made to assess the total dimension of the pollution problem as well as its causes and extent. with the aid of information provided by interior department figures. accompanying experts. and local citizens. the "ships log" recorded the effects of pollution on water quality. on aquatic life. and on the river bank residents. the ecoic effects of pollution on land values along the river and on industrial development of the area. the cost to communities and private industries to clean up the rivers. the recreational opportunities lost by pollution and the present and potential ecoic impact. the effects of pollution on health of people in communities using the river for drinking water and near farms using direct river water for crop irrigation. and the political problems involved in pollution control. franz scholz has written up his observations and conclusions in a series of four articles. entitled "a week on the concord and merrimack rivers. with apologies to henry david thoreau." in doing so. he has provided a valuable public service. for he has brought to the public eye. in stark and at times shocking terms. the critical condition of these streams. he has brought to the attention of the residents of local communities their vested interest in cleaning up these waters. he has stated with force  only the problems immediately at hand. such as the obvious eyesore and health hazard. but also the less visible and longrange effects on the ecoy in terms of opportunities for industrial and recreational development which have been and will continue to be lost if corrective action is  taken. his description is at times startling in its emotion. often shocking in terms of the physical reaction to many of the sights and smells encountered in the journey. franz scholz has conveyed the deep sense of loss and danger which will serve to open the eyes of the unaware. he has described the potential benefits that can motivate broader interest and rally wider support from those who will realize themselves beneficiaries of a clean river. he has provided a greater understanding of what is at stake in the battle to eliminate pollution. these articles appeared over a 2week period in the lowell sun. as they are lengthy in total. but merit close attention. the installments will be divided for on several successive days. the first article follows:
. a great deal has been said on the subject of water pollution. but what we hav needed is action. in new york state under gov. nelson a. rockefeller. we have had action on this subject. i am setting forth gover rockefellers summary as of april 27. 1966. of new york state progress in water pollution and commend it to my colleagues: gover rockefeller today described the states pure waters program as one that "will stand as a major monument of the 1960s to progressive and imaginative thinking and cooperative action in government." the gover outlined signs of progress in this program at the 42d spring banquet of the county officers association at the hotel grossinger at 7:30 p.m. he said he was "deeply gratified" thatover a third of the states municipalities have joined in the program. over a fourth of major construction contemplated for the 6year program is underway or will be this year. comprehensive sewerage planning studies for 583 municipalities are either completed. underway or in the pipeline under 166 joint projects involving 100 percent state aid totaling $7.8 million. also in the planning area. comprehensive water supply studies for 444 municipalities are underway or being negotiated. again with 100percent state aid. totaling nearly $2.4 million. the gover explained that aher program provides onethird state aid for operation and maintenance of sewage disposal plants. ninetyfour such grants totaling $4.8 million have been approved and 55 more applications are expected. but "the most spectacular progress of all." the gover told the county officers. "is in the construction of sewage disposal plants and interceptors for 130 municipalities either underway or planned for this year." these projects will cost $491 millionwith state grants totaling $258 million. gover rockefeller also pointed to (1) projects underway that will enable 39 communities to stop polluting new yorks rivers and lakes.  being audited for state grants amounting to $79 million. (2) the approval of projects for 47 municipalities. to receive state grants of $95 million. on which construction starts this year. and (3) expected applications for projects totaling $137 million in 11 communities. including $135 million for four new york city projects to start this year with state aid of $75 million. the gover also described steps being taken by the health department to enforce antipollution laws in the capital district. along the length of the hudson river. and on the upper mohawk. the genesee basin. and the erieniagara area. health department personnel. "working 50. 60. and even 70hour weeks to prosecute the war on pollution." have won voluntary compliance in more than 95 percent of the cases. according to the gover. the pure waters program. as well as programs to enhance the physical environment and recreational opportunities of new yorkers. are part of broadscaled efforts to improve the whole human environment in new york state. the gover explained.
. on may 16. 1983. -the committee on environment and public works reported s. 1283. a shell bill to reauthorize the solid waste disposal act. on october 28. 1983. the committee favorably reported. by a vote of 14 to 1. s. 757. a bill to amend the act and to reauthorize appropri. ations for 5 years. i am pleased to annce that these bills are scheduled for consideration by the full senate in the next several days. the committee has worked long and hard on these bills and i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation which will. among other things. greatly improve the rcra program. our nations basic program to assure that hazardous wastes are managed properly in a manner that protects human health and the environment. since reporting s. 757 last fall. senators stafford. randolph. mitchell. and i have been working closely with epa administrator bill ruckelshaus. assistant administrator lee thomas. and their able staff to further refine this legislation. their advice and guidance have led to many of the amendments i am introducing today. the agency and interested members of the public have met with us seeking clanfication on v trious provisions of our bill as well a on existing law. the vast majority of these latest amendments are of a technical. conforming. or clarifying nature. some of these amendments. such as the extension of various statutory deadlines. are designed to make the bill more workable and to establish priorities among the numerous tasks assigned to epa. this amendment. like all of those being introduced today. is being printed in the record in advance of actual debate on the bill so that we might receive comments from our colleagues as well as from members of the public. if further changes are needed. they can be made in the next several days. several amendments are still being developed and are. therefore.  included in todays package. these include what i hope will be a committee amendment to address the problem of existing. unlined surface impoundments. and an amendment to the subtitle d program which addresses the problem of open dumps and unsafe sanitary landfills. the subtitle d amendments are being developed by my distinguished colleague from west virginia. senator randolph. and i hope to join him in offering the amendments. we will introduce as soon as possible all amendments that we plan to offer. i urge all of my colleagues who intend to offer amendments to introduce them in the next several days so that we might address them in an orderly fashion and pave the way for prompt passage of this important bill.
yes. one objective of amended paragraph (7) is to give epa the discretion to authorize the land disposal of wastes which have been treated. the focus of the amended language is the protection of health and the environment by diminishing toxicity of wastes or reducing migration of hazardous constituents in wastes. thus. if wastes treated as you describe are of low toxicity or if leachate from them contains safe levels of hazardous constituents. epa may. in its discretion. promulgate regulations specifying the cirumstances in which land disposal is authorized. in considering such questions. epa will almost assuredly take into account whether vast quantities or only small amounts of such wastes are generated. i would anticipate that epa will promptly determine whether such wastes meet the criteria in paragraph (7) and then promulgate the necessary regulations within the specified time. in making this determination. epa will certainly use the best information available to it at the time.*
as the senator ks. wipp will receive  only radioactive wastes. but also hazardous wastes of other characteristics mixed with radioactive wastes. wastes such as these may be subject to regulation under subtitle c of the solid waste disposal act. if special provisions were made for wipp. the effect of new section 3004(b) might be to disrupt the congressionally authorized development of wipp. that facility is designed with engineered multiple barriers isolating the waste placed in it from the environment. these controls provide protection greater than that under the current land disposal standards of rcra. and probaby greater than those imposed by the new minimum techogical standards required by this bill. wipp has gone through an exhaustive process of analysis. and with the licensing and regulation to which it is currently subject. will have been determined to be protective of human health and the environment as definitely and through as thorough a process as by section 3004(b). put simply. the new requirements of section 3004(b) are  needed for wipp.
s choice are behind us. these votes are significant. unequivocal statements of approval. as bill ruckelshaus successor. the shoes lee is being asked to fill are quite a bit larger than when lee took over the job of assistant administrator for hazardous waste and emergency response. as tough as that aa job is. being administrator of the entire agency is markedly more difficult and will require a number of adjustments. many of our environmental laws are structured in such a way as to make the administrator the environmental shepherd of the executive branch. he must ride herd on the other agencies and departments to assure compliance with the law. this responsibility wont make him popular. the vast majority of our environmental laws make the administrator the ultimate decisionmaker. he alone is responsible and accountable. each decision is virtually guaranteed to disappoint or even infuriate one or the other interest group. being administrator of epa often appears to be a thankless job. however. it is a job that must be done and. withstanding the paucity of periodic thanks and praise. it is a job that must be done well. the health and quality of life of our neighbors. children. and childrens children depend on it. it is my hope that as lee enters his office each day he will look at the name of the agency written on the wall and think about his mission. the name environmental protection agency says it all. i believe that lee thomas isup to the challenge and is an excellent choice for this job. he deserves our support  only today but each day he is in office. as one member of congress. i pledge that support and hope that he will feel free to call upon me for advice and counsel as often as he sees fit.
. in conclusion. s. 51 is a good bill. it is a bill that deserves to be enacted into law. as a member of both the committee on environment and public works and the committee on finance. the two committees that have written and recommended passage of this bill. i urge my colleagues to support it. time is of the essence. the issues of public health and environmental protection are too important to ige. we have an opportunity to enact a fivefold expansion of the current superfund and to correct many of the problems that have plagued epas management of the program. it is an opportunity we must  squander.
with respect to the inclusion of a statutory standard by which to test the adequacy of regulations. the original senate bill was silent while the house bill included a standard derived from the resource conservation . and recovery act. namely a requirement that regulations be adequate to "protect human health and the environment." i e that this bill includes such a standard. is that correct.

with respect to the inclusion of a statutory standard by which to test the adequacy of regulations. the original senate bill was silent while the house bill included a standard derived from the resource conservation . and recovery act. namely a requirement that regulations be adequate to "protect human health and the environment." i e that this bill includes such a standard. is that correct.
. we are talking health here. that is what this is all about. it is a health problem. that is where we are wrestling with clean air difficulties. trying to restore clean air to our nation. the principal reason is a health one but. in addition. there are environmental problems that arise in these attainment areas of the country. to continue my discussion. if i might. with the attainment section of the bill. the bill imposes certain requirements everywhere in the region. whether or  a particular portion is in a attainment area. because emissions from everywhere in the region contribute to the high ozone levels that are experienced from virginia to maine. unless controls are consistent in areas downwind of attainment areas like those in my own state of rhode island. level of control in a single. isolated attainment area will be sufficient to bring that area into attainment. let me e one last provision related to ozone. currently. ocs facilities off the coast of california and in the gulf of mexico are  required to meet the same emissions requirements that similar facilities onshore must meet. the result in california has been that emissions from the ocs have affected the ability of onshore attainment areas to reduce emissions sufficiently to meet the federal air quality standards. to address this problem. the committee bill transfers authority for control of ocs air pollution from the department of the interior to epa and requires epa to mandate the same controls as would be required if the facility were onshore. the carbon moide and particulate matteror pm10provisions in the bill are similar in structure to the ozone provisions. that is. areas that have failed to meet either the co health standard or the pm10 health standard are separated into categoriesin each case. two categoriesand each category is assigned control requirements and deadlines of later than 5 or 10 years to meet the health standard. milestones of progress are required. for all attainment areas. the bill prescribes consequences or sanctions for areas that fail to meet certain requirements. for areas that do  submit acceptable plans to implement the requirements of the law or that fail to implement the measures that were proposed in the plans or to meet interim emission reduction milestones. the bill requires the administrator of epa to prohibit construction of new sources that will emit pollutants that contribute to attainment. the secretary of transportation is also directed to approve only those highway projects. defined in the bill. that will improve. rather than diminish. air quality. areas that fail to attain the ambient air quality -health standard by the deadline established in the bill are moved into the next higher attainment category. with all the requirements of that category. and for ozone areas that fail to meet a deadline. major stationary sources of vocs are required to reduce voc emissions by 50 percent below emissions in the year of the deadline or pay $5.000 for each ton above that 50 percent level. these provisions are designed to achieve emission reductions or. at least avoid emissions increases. in areas that have shown either that they can carry out an acceptable control program or that the program is  working as it was designed to.
. i think that this legislation we are dealing with takes on an extra sense of urgency. i hope those individuals who have some qualms about the bill or can find every detail to match their standards of approval or receive their approval. will say. "look. there is a greater good to be obtained here." what we are really seeking is to improve the air quality of our nation. for two reasons: environmental reasons. what it does to the lakes. streams. and soil of our country. and also for health reasons. infant mortality reasons. life expectancy reasons. and the pain and suffering that comes when people are suffering from chronic disorders. bronchitis. and other healthafflicting diseases that arise from polluting air.
. i am pleased that the senate has given its approval to the indoor air quality act of 1990. s. 657. this bill provides for a substantial research and development initiative to uncover harmful pollutants in our indoor environment. and will focus the efforts of the federal government to address this problem. over the last decade we have made considerable progress in abating some of the most harmful pollutants of our outdoor environment. emissions from cars are longer as injuflous to the air quality and. if we are successful in reauthorizing a clean air act. auto emissions will be reduced even more. leaded gasoline. kn to cause health effects in children. is being phased out. once unsightly rivers are  returning to a state where they are fishable and swimmable. yet for all this progress. we have  turned out attention to the environment where americans spend an average of 90 percent of their time indoors. much is kn about the effects of some indoor contaminants. such as radon. asbestos. and tobacco smoke. however. there are several other contaminants prevalent in the indoor environment about which very little is kn. these include formaldehyde. volatile organic chemicals. combustion byproducts and respirable particles. there is a great likelihood that these pollutants pose a serious threat to public health. the threat from these chemicals may be heightened by the fact that many of us live and work in virtually airtight buildings. soaring energy costs over the past two .decades spurred conservation efforts which led to the construction of office buildings in which you can open the windows. these wellinsulated. energy efficient buildings often seal in potentially hazardous substances while reducing the amount of fresh air. to date. relatively little attention has been given to the quality and potential health effects of the air inside our homes and offices. but there is mounting evidence that the air we breathe indoors may be at least as polluted with cigarette smoke. radioactive radon gas. and formaldehyde as the smog outside. in a significant development. epa  concludes that the risk to human health from indoor air contaminants may be at least as great as those from the outdoor environment. in a recent report. epa es that: sufficient evidence exists to conclude that indoor air pollution represents a major portion of the publics exposure to air pollution and may pose serious acute and chronic health risks. this evidence warrants an expanded effort to characterize and mitigate this exposure. this statement represents a major step forward in the agencys thinking about what needs to be done to address indoor air pollution. one of the most ubiquitous forms of indoor air pollution is environmental tobacco smoke. with over 54 million smokers in the united states. cigarette fumes will undoubtedly rank as one of the most significant sources of indoor air pollution. passive smoking may be associated with a wide range of health problems. including increased risk for respiratory illnesses. lung cancer. and heart disease. it is estimated by the surgeon general that up to 5.000 smokers may die each year from lung cancer caused by inhaling other peoples smoke. at a hearing on the health effects of indoor air pollution before the committee on environment and public works. it became painfully clear that there is  an adequate effort by federal agencies or states. to conduct research on indoor air contaminants. the legislation being approved today. introduced by senator mitchll. myself. and others. will direct the various agencies responsbile for indoor air quality to coordinate their response plans to address these contaminants. the bill will place the environmental protection agency squarely in the lead in developing the federal response to indoor air contamination. let me describe the key elements of this legislation. first. the bill establishes a research program for indoor air. this is undoubtedly an appropriate federal role. to identify the risk posed by our indoor. environment. information learned from this research must be shared with the states and the private sector. second. the legislation will require epa to establish health advisories. these advisories must be written in plain english. and must make it clear to the average citizen how he can best minimize exposure and adverse health effects from indoor contaminants. third. the measure also provides for limited grant assistance to states for development of management strategies and response programs. fourth. the bill will authorize the national institute of occupational safety and health [nioshi to conduct assessments of sick buildings. estimates of lost worker productivity due to symptoms attributable to sick buildings is in the billions of dollars. also. i have added a provision to the legislation requiring epa to conduct an assessment of the seriousness and extent of indoor air contamination in schools. as with radon. children may be at greater risk from harmful chemicals due to a higher respiratory rate. and the fact that their internal organs are still developing. a related amendment will prevent the exposure of thousands of our schoolchildren to dangerous levels of radon gas. this provision requires schools located in radon high risk areas to test for radon. these high risk areas are being identified by epa pursuant to the radon bill which i and other members of this committee authored in the last congress. the legislation further provides a loan and/or grant program of $5 mllion for each of 5 years for schools which need to mitigate radon. and need financial assistance to do so. although some mitigation work can be costly. most mitigation consists of adjustments to ventilation. installation of fans. and depressurizing and sealing a foundation. these techniques do  usually cost a great deal. it is important that we take steps to protect our children from radon gas. which could be claiming as many as 20.000 lives per year. radon has been identified by the environmental protection agency as the largest single course of lung cancer other than smoking. i would like to make it clear that this legislation does  place the federal government in the living rooms of americans. the bill does  provide authority to regulate indoor air contaminants. but rather takes an informational approach. the health advisories. for example. will indicate the health risks at various concentration levels. and inform home owners of ways to reduce and minimize the risk from various contaminants. the best defense we have against an unhealthy indoor environment is an informed consumer. for example. home owners need to be made aware of the health risks associated with using certain pesticides in the home. if this information can be communicated 8 14m1 effectively. the marketplace will send a strong signal to pesticide manufacturers. consumers demand safe pesticides for home use. the same can be true for cleaning solvents. furniture stripper. and a host of other chemicals which we bring into our home. americans need to k how to ensure that the quality of the air inside their home and office is healthy. we must begin to address the health threat posed by contaminants of the air indoors. passage of this legislation is a major step in this direction.
s council on environmental quality. ceq would be responsible for developing an awards selection process and for establishing a timetable for the process. the selection criteria should include. but  be limited to the creativity of the teaching method or project: the transferability of the teaching method or project to other teachers. the effectiveness of the teacher in increasing students understanding and appreciation of the environment. and the positive impact of the teacher on students. parents. and other teachers. ceq should work with the environmental protection agency. the department of education. the department of health and human services. the national science foundation. and other federal agencies and existing national. state. and local environmental and education organizations to the maximum extend possible to identify potential award recipients. * this provision establishes a high level awards program which emphasizes the importance of teachers who can educate our youth to prevent pollution and protect the environment. to ensure a cleaner environment for future generations. we must begin to educate children today. the national environmental education act is a positive step in this direction.
. i would like to enter into a short colloquy with senators moynihan and hollings regarding h.r. 2130. a bill authorizing appropriations for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. in particular i would like to focus on title v of this bill. which establishes a comprehensive program for consistent monitoring of the nations marine ecosystems. this title was jointly developed by the committee on commerce. science. and transportation. and the committee on environment and public works. it will be jointly administered by the environmental protection agency and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. section 503 of the bill specifies that "primary leadership for the monitoring program activities conducted by the environmental protection agency pursuant to this sectin shall be located at the environmental research laboratory in narragansett. ri." it is my understanding that this language will ensure that headquarters for the monitoring program which will be established pursuant to this legislation will be located at the epa laboratory currently located in narragansett. the personnel primarily responsible for implementing the program will located at the laboratory. such implementation will include: developing and implementing intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs in accordance with the legislation. identifying and analyzing the status of environmental quality in the nations coastal ecosystems. . assessing ambient water quality. benthic environmental quality. and the health and quality of living organisms. identifying sources of environmental degradation affecting the nations coastal ecosystems. in addition. personnel located at the program headquarters in narragansett will be responsible for providing the scientific basis for the development of coastal water quality monitoring guidelines. such guidelines will provide for uniformity. establish scientifically valid monitoring methods. and identify appropriate indicators of the health and quality of coastal ecosystems. is this consistent with the understanding of the chairmen of the committee on commerce. science. and transportation. and the committee on environment and public works.
. i am pleased to join the majority leader. senator mrrimell. in bringing s. 656. the indoor air quality act of 1993 to the floor for consideration by the full senate. this legislation will result in significantly improving the quality of the air we breathe indoors. before i describe the bill and its importance in protecting human health. i want to e that similar legislation was approved by the senate during the 102d congress by a vote of 88 to 7. the indoor air quality act of 1993 establishes a national program to reduce the threat to human life posed by exposure to contaminants in the air indoors. the bill .will provide for a substantial research and development initiative to uncover harmful pollutants in our indoor environment. and will focus the efforts of the federal government to address this problem. by directing our efforta at providing clean indoor air. we will make strides toward preventing health problems before they occur. our nation spends billions of dollars each year on health care. unfortunately often after the fact. many of the illnesses we experience. however. are preventable. in terms of public health. this bill will provide us with a muchneeded ounce of prevention. and help us to avoid the costly pound of cure in treating respiratory illnesses. over the last decade we have made considerable progress in abating some of the most harmful pollutants of our outdoor environment. emissions from cars are longer as injurious to air quality. and. under the clean air act. -auto emissions. will be reduced even more. leaded gasoline. kn to cause health serious negative effects in children. is being phased out. once unsightly rivers are  returning to a state where they are fishable and swimmable. yet for all this progress. we have  turned our attention in a significant way to the environment where americans spend an average of 90 percent of their time: indoors. much is kn. about the effects of some indoor contaminants. such as radon. asbestos. and tobacco smoke. however. there are several other contaminants prevalent in the indoor environment about which very little is kn. these include formaldehyde. volatile organic chemicals. and combustion byproducts. * the threat from these contaminants may be heightened by the fact. that many of us live and work in virtually airtight buildings. soaring energy costs over the past two decades have spurred conservation efforts which led to the construction of office buildings in which you cannqe open the windows. these well insulated. energy efficient buildings often seal in potentially hazardous substances while reducing the amount of fresh air available to breathe. to date. relatively little attention has been given to the quality and potential health effects of the air inside our homes and offices. but there is mounting evidence that the air we breathe indoors may be at least as polluted with cigarette smoke. radioactive radon gas. and formaldehyde as the smog outside. in a significant development. epa  concludes that the risk to human health from indoor air contaminants may be at least as great as those from the outdoor environment. in a report on indoor air contamination. epa es that: sufficient evidence exists to conclude that indoor air pollution represents a major portion of the publics exposure to air pollution and may pose serious acute and chronic health risks. this evidence warrants an expanded effort to characterize and mitigate this exposure. this statement represents a major step forward in the agencys thinking about what needs to be done to address indoor air pollution. at a hearing on the health effects of indoor air pollution before the committee on environment and public works. it became painfully clear that there is  an adequate effort by federal agencies or states to conduct research on indoor air contaminants. this bill will direct the various agencies responsible for indoor air quality to coordinate their response plans to address these contaminants. the bill will place the environmental protection agency squarely in the lead in developing the federal response to indoor air contamination. let me describe the key elements of this legislation. first. the bill establishes a research program for indoor air. this is an appropriate federal role. to identify the risk posed by our indoor environment. information developed by this research must be shared with the states and the private sector. second. the legislation will require epa to establish health advisories. these advisories must be written in plain english. and must make it clear to the average citizen how he can best minimize exposure and adverse health effects from indoor contaminants. third. the measure also provides for limited grant assistance to states for development of management strategies and response programs. fourth. the bill will authorize the national institute of occupational safety and health [niosi] to conduct assessments of sick buildings. estimates of lost worker productivity due to symptoms attributable to sick buildings is in the billions of dollars. also. i have added a provision to the legislation requiring epa to conduct an assessment of the seriousness and extent of indoor air contamination in schools. as with radon. children may be at greater risk from harmful chemicals due to a higher respiratory rate. and the fact that their internal organs are still developing. i would like to make it clear that this legislation does  place the federal government in the living rooms of americans. the bill does  provide authority to regulate indoor air contaminants. but rather takes an informational approach. the health advisories. for example. will indicate the health risks at various concentration levels. and inform homeowners of ways to reduce and minimize the risk from various contaminants. the best defense we have against an unhealthy indoor environment is an informed consumer. for example. homeowners need to be made aware of the health risks associated with using certain chemicals in the home. if this information can be communicated effectively. the marketplace will send a strong signal to manufacturers: consumers demand safe products for home use. americans need to k how to ensure that the quality of the air inside their homes and offices is healthy. we must begin to address the health threat posed by contaminants of the air indoors. s. 656. the indoor air quality act of 1993 is a major step in this direction. i urge my colleagues to support the bill.
madam president. i would like to clarify the application of the new standard setting authorities established by the bill to the stage i rulemaking for disinfectants and disinfection byproducts that epa has proposed. the use of chlorine to kill pathogenic organisms in drinking water presents a real challenge. on the one hand. disinfection of public water supplies is a public health miracle. one of the witnesses at our hearings on this bill called it the single most important public health advance in history. on the other hand. the use of chlorine as a disinfectant may producechemical byproducts in the water that present other health risks. epa has proposed a rule for disinfectants and disinfection byproducts that attempts to balance these risks. the proposed rule was developed through a regulatory negotiation that included representatives of local governments. water agencies and water supply districts. and public interest groups. epa used this approach because current law does  contain explicit authority to balance risks in the way that epa has proposed to do in this rulemaking. presumably. one reason for the negotiation was to avoid a subsequent court challenge to the rule. . we are changing the law and we are including explicit authority for the administrator to take a risk balancing approach where it is appropriate. these changes would authorize epa to issue the type of rule that has been proposed in stage i for disinfection byproducts. but in passing this bill. we face a delicate legislative task. we want to endorse the risk balancing approach that epa is taking and make it clear that the statute as amended authorizes such a ruleincluding the stage i rulebut we dont want these new statutory provisions to disturb the negotiated agreement that is incorporated in the rule that epa has proposed.
. i want to thank my colleague from vermont. senator stafford. my colleague from texas. senator bentsen. and the members of the environment and public works committee for their recognition of the continuing need to eliminate threats to the nations health from environmental pollution. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
. the amendment we propose would be of significant benefit in implementing the mandates of the toxic substances control act. it would enable selected states to develop demonstration programs to protect against unreasonable risks to health or the environment associated with chemical substances and mixtures. through a demonstration program. states .like new jersey could obtain the data necessary to make reasoned decisions as to the dangers to humans resulting from exposure to toxic substances. it would also provide the basis for state management measures to be proposed in the demonstration states and elsewhere. especially important. it would coordinate state programs with federal programs. demonstrating methods to minimize the burden upon industry in the requirements for submission of information and data to the several levels of government that are involved in toxic and other environmental programs. our amendment would provide for state demonstration grants in less than one. and more than three states. the key elements of such state programs would be: first. to identify and inventory chemical substances and mixtures in the state at various stages in their cycle of use. second. to monitor the extent to which such chemical substances or mixtures are present in the environment of such state. and the extent to which human beings in that state are exposed to them. third. to establish a state program that would prevent or eliminate unreasonable risks to health or the environment from chemical substances or mixtures. to integrate toxic substances management programs with other environmental and public health programs so as to minimize the overall pollution of the states environment. and to identify the appropriate governmental institutions and processes necessary to implement such a program. this point is of particular importance. for too long we have seen pollution control techogies which merely serve to transfer the problem from one medium to ahersuch as air pollution techogies which remove contaminants from the air and put them into the water cycle instead. this is hardly a solution. fourth. to analyze and evaluate the resuits of such programs through annual reports to the administrator of epa. the administrator of epa. in turn. must submit annual reports to the congress on the progress of the demonstration projects. recommend ways for other states to implement toxic substances management programs. and recommend additional legislation if necessary. the administrators report must describe the extent to which he has disseminated the information derived from the demonstration programs to other interested states and persons. this is  a demonstration program to be funded and then forgotten. epa will be under a mandate to study. evaluate. and make kn what has been learned from the demonstrations. so that others will benefit. there is authorized for each fiscal year. 1977. 1978. and 1979. $2 million. with the federal share of the program  to exceed 75 percent. there are explicit provisions that these funds will  be used to duplicate other requirements and programs. as i stated earlier. one of the primary objectives of this demonstration program is federalstate coordination so as to minimize the burdens on industry. our amendment would give priority for grants under this section to those states where the problem of the effects of toxic substances are most acute. specifically. the administrators project selection must consider: first. the existence of serious health effects associated with chemical substances within such state. including cancer. birth defects. and gene mutations. second. the extent to which chemical substances and mixtures are manufactured. processed. distributed in commerce. used and disposed of within such state. and third. the extent of exposure of human beings and the environment to chemical substances and mixtures within such state. finally. this amendment assures that hing in this new section increases or decreases the authorities of a state. as established under section 18. preemption. new jerseyans were shocked to learn earlier this year that our state has the highest rate of cancer in the country.  for one. but for all types of cancer. we were totally unprepared for this news. we k that exposure to certain chemicals can cause cancer. but there remain many. too many. unanswered questions. we need to identify these chemicals. find out what quantities of them pose a hazard. andmost importantwe must find out what- we can do to reduce the risk to new jerseyans. it seems to us that adoption of this amendment to the toxic substances bill would provide the means to find answers to these questions. this amendment would be of great significance in helping our state and other states with similar problems to develop demonstration programs to protect against unreasonable risks to health or the environment associated with chemical substances and mixtures. it provides for demonstration programs with federal participation jointly with the states. it authorizes $2 million a year for 3 years. and the states must participate to the extent of 25 percent. i understand that the amendment is agreeable to the miity and the majority.
that is correct. i am only referring  to the measures to which the senator adverted a moment ago. as i said. that goes for the bill for higher education. as to debris in the last congress it goes for the mass transportation bill. the youth employment and civilian conservation corps measures. and the medicare bill. which was defeated in this chamberpartially. i think. because the finance committee did  hold hearings on it. that was one of the arguments which was referred to in the debate on the bill. i also ed with great interestand i am perfectly willing to face the senator from georgia or any other senator on this scorethat the majority leader did  even mention civilrights legislation. yet today i have on my desk one of the most horrible reports on injustice in this countrya report from the advisory committee appointed by the u.s. civil rights commission in mississippi. and i will bring it to the floor and discuss it in great detail and put it into the record. it shows that american citizens are being outraged and denied elemental justiceincluding denial of the right to votein one of the sovereign states. i think that situation is very important. in short. i think one of the reasons why the country may very well be questioning whether we are doing our business is that our hands are tied by the rules of the senate. which on occasion completely frustrate our efforts. it seems to me that we have spent a decent amount of time in the effort to do something about these procedures. which in many cases have prevented us from dealing effectively with the very legislation to which the distinguished majority leader has referred. i think every senator who has participated in that fight is just as patriotic. just as anxious to get on with the public business. just as devoted to getting things in the country done. as every senator who has agreed today with the majority leaders statement that we have wasted. 6 weeks of time. i do  think we have wasted a minute. and i do  think we are wasting a minute . i think this rules fight is critically important to the nation and to the capability of the senate to conduct its business. i believe it would be demeaning to those of us who participated with deep devotion in that fight to sit by and. without comment by us. let such statements be made and let them ride. i have  expended my efforts and my time on a struggle which i thik was a waste of the time of the senate. and i can remain silent when such statements are made.
