. i listened to the proponents of this amendment. and as pointed out by the distinguished chairman. the manager of the bill. i have listened to the persuasive arguments of the opponents of the bill. i must say i have  researched it in such depth as my distinguished colleague from new york. but i have visited many day care centers. and it is regrettable that this important piece of legislation has to come before the senate in the waning days of the session and at 10:21 at night with so many senators who are tired and so many senators  in the chamber. because it is a very vital piece of legislation. what are we talking about. we are  talking about cars and airplanes. air fare. and all those things that have been mentioned. we are talking about children. and we are talking about children in the most formative years of their lives. the preschool years. all the arguments that have been made are money arguments. i k we want to retain our fiscal sanity. and we have to be concerned about the cost of these major programs. but we are  concerned with merely putting a supervisor on a playground and watching the children play tag. that is what is wrong in the country today. these children are on the playgrounds. running the streets with supervision at all. and consequently in the very early years of their lives they develop some of the habits which follow them throughout their lives. studies have indicated these children are  able to comprehend. they are  able to learn. they are slow readers. and when they go to school as our committee found out when we had exhaustive hearings on this subject. they fall far behind and they never catch up. they are doomed at birth and it keeps perpetuating itself so that generation after generation we have hundreds of thousands of children who are growing up in the jungle. who are let run loose like wild animals without a real opportunity to learn so that when they get to school they are completely unable to cope with the educational process. . what kind of parents are we talking about. we are  talking about advantaged or educated parents. in the main. we are talking about poor. disadvantaged parents who themselves have  had the benefit of education. so what does that child get when he goes home. he has been in a day care center. with supervision as he plays tag. some have psychiatric problems. some have psychological problems. and some have grave need for psychiatric and psychological care at that early age. so if we would provide these services it would help us down the road when we do  have to bother with the children who would become dope addicts. criminal offenders. and all the other myriad of social problems that come as a result of unattended children. two of the most important programs we have had. and they have been successful. are headstart and the day care centers. as has been pointed out by the distinguished proponent of this proposal. you talk about $2.400 and going to $3.000. but in the main most of them are getting $800 for the care of two children. what kind of care can you give that one child for $800. it is hardly any care at all. they are sometimes worse off in that situation than they are at home. again. we are concerned with children who in many instances come from fatherless homes. so when they go home they have paternal supervision at all. as pointed out by my distinguished colleague from wyoming. or the distinguished manager of the bill. the mother has been working all day. she is tired when she gets home. and she has perhaps four or five teenage children to cope with. she does  have the reserve of energy to even give supervision or any guidance to this preschool age child who is in a day care center. so we are talking about something much more than just dollars and cents. we. are talking about the future of this country because we are going to continue to have thousands and hundreds of thousands of children run wild in the streets of this nation. and we are going to perpetuate all the social ills we have today. they are going to be multiplied over and over again. and we are going to compound our problems. we are  adding money to this bill. we are asking for a distribution formula. i wish to ask the senator from minnesota if that is correct.
