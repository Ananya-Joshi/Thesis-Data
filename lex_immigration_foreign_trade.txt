madam president. i thank the distinguished senator from texas for her very kind comments. we appreciate those remarks. she is absolutely right. the senior senator did do a splendid job  just for his state but all the trucks coming and going in connection with the nafta agreement. particularly the border crossings down in her state. we are pleased things came out the way they did. we look forward to her support when we bring the bill up on the floor.
