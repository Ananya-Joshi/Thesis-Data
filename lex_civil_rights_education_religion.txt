. i rise to oppose the amendment. i have tracked this type of shenanigans ever since i came to the u.s. senate. the last time we debated. it was the rights of black schoolchildren. and we were going to go ahead and deny to the courts the remedies necessary to assure that they had equality of educational opportunity.  we want to go ahead and strip the courts of their ability to assure religious freedom to all americans. please do  be beguiled by the term "school prayer." what is being discussed here is government prayer. governmentorganized prayer. and if government can organize silent prayer. it can organize vocal prayer. if it can organize vocal prayer. it can organize the words that are said in that vocal prayer. we are a diverse nation of many beliefs. i do  want the u.s. government interfering in religion of mine or anybody elses children. we want to worship vigorously for what we believe in.  for what is dictated from the floor of the u.s. senate. but the point of issue before us here today is that once the courts are stripped of their ability to protect our constitutional rights. they are forever stripped. at one time it was unpopular to be a black school child in america. maybe it will be unpopular to be old. maybe it will be unpopular to be handicapped. the fact is that regardless of the politics or the philosophies of the times. the courts stand there to protect us all. to make sure that we can flower and grow within this great democracy of ours as we choose. once you strip the courts of the authority to protect in this narrow instance. then you have taken away from that branch of government its capacity to remedy forever. i understand the popular buzzwords of the time. i understand that it would be nice. in other words. if you vote to table this amendment. to say. "well. such and such a senator is against prayer in school" or "such and such a senator is for busing." that is  the issue. that is  the issue.
