. on march 18. a young man of great promise and courage lost his battle with serious kidney disease and died. wendell pigman. legislative assistant to frank church. and only 42 years of age was a valued aid and creative thinker. he first came to the hill from nasa as a congressional fellow in the office of my late colleague. senator robert kennedy. because of his ability and dedication in that assignment. he was asked to join the senators staff full time. and served as legislative assistant to senator kennedy. after the senators death. he served in the same capacity with congressman max mccarthy of new york before joining senator church in 1971. while working with congressman mccarthy. he was instrumental in bringing to the attention of the public the vital issues concerned in chemical and biological warfare. while it is always tragic when one so young dies. his family must take pride in the extraordinary service he rendered to his country during his short life. my wife joins me in extending our deepest sympathies to his wife nancy. who was senator everett saltonstalls legislative assistant. and to their son geoffrey.
