subsequently said: . much unnecessary hardship. delay. grief and frustration has accompanied the process of admission of alien orphans adopted by american families. one of the important humanitarian activities that were designed to alleviate some of the miseries of the second world war. the alien orphans program. which has been continuing on a temporary basis. should  be made permanent under the legislation just introduced by the senator from wisconsin and myself. the alien orphans program was begun as part of the displaced persons act of 1948 and has been extended by the act of july 1953. the refugee relief act of 1953. public law 85316. public law 85253 and public law 86648. it has enriched the lives of thousands of childless american couples and brought happiness and a chance for productive growth as americans to the homeless waifs they have adopted. this bill establishes safeguards against such abuses as have developed in the course of the program. eliminates the threat of commercialism in proxy adoptions. and sets standards for children adopted abroad equal to those which prevail here. authority to accept assurances that the child will find a suitable home with parents who have qualified under preadoption requirements is placed with the department of health. education. and welfare. this will have the effect of eliminating the undesirable practices under previous legislation and meets the needs and requirements of all interested parties. by the adoption of this legislation. the program can become as it should a permanent part of our law.
