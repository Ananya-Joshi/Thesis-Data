. i can well remember in june and really through september of 1988. the terrible fires that took place in wyoming and yellowstone park and can remember the concern of the distinguished senator from wyoming. both senators from wyoming. in connection with that matter and their very strong views that the policy that the national park service and fish and wildlife. i suppose. and others had adopted toward control of the fires. being somebody from the east. i was interested to learn more about the whole process. i. frankly. can claim any expertise about those great fires out west. so i think this proposal of the senator from wyoming. cosponsored by the senator from montana. for a study of.  only the environmental effects. which would come from the environmental protection agency. but also the centers for disease control. for them to analyze what are the effects of these tremendous clouds of smoke that go up from the burned wood and forest. i think it is a good amendment. and i commend the sponsors for it.
