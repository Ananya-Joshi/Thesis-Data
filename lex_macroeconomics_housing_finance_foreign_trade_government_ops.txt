 section 308 of the bill provides low interest rate3 percentrehabilitation loans that can be made for the improvement of properties in an urban renewal area. in order to have the rehabilitation loan program do its share. the authorization for that purpose was established in the 1964 housing act at $50 million. all of the funds have  been appropriated. it is included into the independent office appropriation in both the house and in the senate following appropriation of loan funds in the second supplemental appropriation act of fiscal year 1965. the house report referred to the program as a useful. and important one which was supported by considerable testimony in the record of hearings. the house left this program without a ceiling. it took off the $50 million ceiling. however. the house. in its report. said that the proper amount to be filled in here was at least $100 million per year. as we in the senate always like to have things go out with a firm ceiling. i believe this is the proper way in which to do it. at the same time the increased limit gives some feeling of definiteness and assurance to the many thousands who are involved in this particular program. and responds to the type of strong testimony which substantiated the program.  only before the banking and currency committees. but also before the appropriations committee. i have taken this amendment up with the majority and miity. i understand that by way of fixing a ceiling before the matter leaves the senate this is the desirable thing to do. the program of rehabilitation loans in support of local rehabilitation efforts in urban renewal areas. sponsored in the house by congressman widnall. deserves strong backing.
