. i hope that the house will give prompt approval to this long overdue legislation. while more and more groups in our society have moved forward to full participation in our ecoy and our national growth. the men and women who have served our government faithfully over the years have been left behind. we should never have permitted the income of the majority of the 700.000 annuitants and their survivors to fall below the $3.000 poverty level.  we have an opportunit to right this wrong and guard against such developments in the future. this bill will increase the annuities of those who retired on or before october 1. 1956. by approximately 10.2 percent and the annuities of those who retired after that date by approximately 5.2 percent. this difference is necessary to close the gap in the pensions  available to those early retirees. the 1956 amendments were of great benefit to those who retired after that date. but did hing for those already retired. this legislation will  right the balance completely. but it goes a long way toward that goal. the other significant amendment would change the formula for the determination of the costofliving increases. according to the findings of the post office and civil service committee. this automatic provision has  worked successfully because of the lag between the increase in the cost of living and its reflection in the annuity checks. this measure. by providing for immediate reflection in the annuities after a 3month period of 3month increases in the index. should give those on fixed incomes immediate relief from inflation. i urge the passage of h.r. 8469.
