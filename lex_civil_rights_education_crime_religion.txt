but it would be my intention as the manager of this bill to see this matter resolved this evening. we have prayer in school coming up. we have all sorts of further incursions into the judiciary coming up. we have got abortion coming up. we are going to hit every one of these problems held on . never mind the fact that the proponents of this type of legislation can accomplish their work within the authorizing process. but they are  going to get their way here. and they are  going to get it on this bill. there is a lot of good work that has gone into this product. and it deserves to pass instead of this constant circumvention of the constitutional process by those who just cann wait to achieve their particular radical ends. well this radicalism from the left has to filter through that constitutional process and so is it going to filter through that process when it comes from the right. so understand if we want -to exercise our prerogative and say what it is these budgets are going to consist of and what the priorities are going to be. then let us pass this state. justice bill. otherwise we will lose that opportunity and it becomes a matter of last years priorities or the administrations priorities.
