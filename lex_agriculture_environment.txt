. in june of 1945. it was reported that the department of agriculture was considering a change in the formula under which the aaa conservation funds would be distributed among the states. the new england delegation in the senate and the house of representatives authorized the appointment of a committee to discuss this with mr. ris e. dodd. then chief of the agricultural adjustment agency and  director of the field service branch of the production and marketing administration in the department. the committee learned that such a change was proposed and that. under each of the tentative formulas being considered. the federal participation in the program in the theastern region would be substantially reduced. consequently. the committee presented to mr. dodd and to secretary anderson a statement of the conservation needs of theastern soils and attempted to establish the proposition that any new formula would operate inequitably against the theastern states unless it actually increased their proportionate share of the funds. a copy of this statement is inserted in the hearings at pages 1694 and 1695. we argued that the conservation needs of the soil should be. the primary consideration and that the soil requirements in the theast are actually greater than in most other parts .of the country. we pointed out that the soils along the atlantic seaboard have been cultivated extensively over a long period of time. thereby removing a considerable part of the plant food through continual cropping. that our agriculture was intensive in character. that in some sections we had several crops a year. that the pasture season there is relatively long that the rainfall in these states is heavier than in many other agricultural areas of the country. resulting in substantial leaching of minerals and that this has left our soils more deficient in many of the essential minerals than in areas of. lower rainfall. and that this. also. resulted in a relatively greater loss of soil through erosion.- we showed that our farm land is very hilly in its nature and that this required extensive conservation practices and the application of minerals to encourage a vigorous growth of forage crops to check erosion. we stressed the fact that an acreage basis would  be a fair method of determination for the distribution of funds because of the heavy concentration of population in the theast. where most of the food produced is consumed locally. we suggested that the application of any new formula which would result in a limitation of the mineral treatment to the soil meant a reduction in the food production in the theast and would require additional feed to be shipped into that area. incidentally. this is an extremely critical problem with us  because of the shortage of feed for poultry and cattle. we called attention to the fact that the theastern states were farmed before the development of our present agricultural planting and harvesting machinery and that many of the planting and harvesting operations are still performed in a limited way. that we had developed many small fields. lined by stone walls and hedge rows. and that these could  be effectively farmed and erosion prevented with the use of modern agricultural machinery unless many of them were combined. after summarizing our contention. we urged secretary anderson and mr. dodd to emphasize the actual true conservation needs in developing any revised formula. we took occasion. also. to point out that there had been relatively very small expenditures in these nine states under the aaa program. and that under the pace committee formula our basic conservation needs justified a request for approximately 12.1 percent of any available funds annually. however. we were  successful. and the new formula was developed. which is shown in the table at pages 1252 and 1253 of the hearings. it is perfectly clear from mr. dodds testimony as to the reason for the change in the formula that it is  based upon any accurate appraisal of the respective needs of funds for true conservation practices. at page 1250 of the hearings you will e that he testified that the change was "because of the pressure for money. because the requests for assistance have been so great that it had to develop a new formula for distributing the money among the states." yet. if you will examine the table at pages 1252 and 1253 of the hearings. you will e that in contrast to the 1945 apportionment there will be 22 of the 48 states where the conservation work in the current year will necessarily be sharply reduced below the amount done last year. it is extremely difficult to reconcile such a result with the repeated testimony of all of the witnesses. including mr. dodd. that there is greater need for increased sound conservation practices in every state during this immediate postwar period. when the soil throughout the united states has been so seriously depleted by reason of the war effort. a closer examination of the new formula leads to the compelling conclusion that the $86.216.000. which is to be distributed on the basis of total cropland and orchard acreage multiplied by 18.6 cents. is a highly artificial and thoroughly unscientific item. indeed. in explaining this item mr. dodd stated at page 1254 of the hearings that it was the balance of the money left. the table itself shows that every other item was developed upon the basis of existing data and that the rate applied was an even amount. yet. after having completed the computations in colums 2 to 7. inclusive. the department found itself with a balance of $86.260.000. and i submit that it is perfectly obvious that it then divided that amount by the total cropland and orchard acreage and arrived at the fractional figure of 18.6 cents. we unsuccessfully attempted to present our request to the department that any revision of the existing formula in these postwar days should fairly reflect a scientific and accurate appraisal of the actual and true conservation needs throughout the country. it is most significant that mr. dodds testimony contains the frank statement. at page 1254. in reply to a question by the gentleman from washington which i would like to quote here:
. this bears out the fact also that if we are going to proceed in this way. it should be just as possible for us to proceed in this way with regard to health. education. and housing. as it is for farm conservation practices. the senator from arkansas . the chairman of the appropriations committee.. said exactly that in the debate on monday which relates somewhat to the same problem. i think it is so pertinent here that we have the right to invoke this precedent when we come to other bills of the exact same kind with exactly the same language. i have already given ice that i will raise this issue on the supplemental. which i think the senator from arkansas has considered. and the senator from th carolina
