madam president. thank you madam president. some have argued that fasttrack procedures are either unnecessary or that they are a threat to congress constitutional authority. or both. the answer to that is fast track is e of the above. it is both necessary and constitutional. first of all. fast track is absolutely critical if the uziited states is to continue- to expand global market opportunities for american manufactnrers and service providers and their workers. without fast track. president can assure our trading partners that the terms of a hardwonagreement will  be rewrittenr by congress. that is the problem. . sometimes it is worthwhile_ to look at history. in 1934. congress approved the reciprocal trade agreements act. which gave the president authority to lower tariffs with our trading partners. that worked fine for several decades. this was when we still had an emergingglobal trading system which primarily relied on tariffs. between 1934 and 1945 the united states concluded 29 bilateral agreements for tariff reductions. when the gatt system came into being in 1948. the system still worked. tariff reductions were the main focus of five successful negotiating rounds between 1947 and but here comes the modern system. by the 1960s. the world trading system had become much more sophisticated and so had trade barriers. in 1962. the kennedy round began. and for the first time the negotiations addressed  just tariffs but tariff problems such as antidumping measures. when the negotiations concluded on the kennedy round in 1967. the johnson administration brought the agreement back home. but congress promptly passed legislation nullifying part of the kennedy round agreement. effectively amending the deal that had been so carefully worked out with the gatt nations. the result. what happened. the kennedy round went into effect without our participation. the message which that sent to our trading partners was obvious. hardfought trade deals with the united states will  stick. and the corollary lesson to the united states was equally clear. before the united states will be allowed back at the negotiating table. it must restore its credibility by demonstrating its ability to stick to a deal. therefore. when the tokyo round -began. president ford appealed to a democratic congress for a solution. the dilemma was ed that our negotiators can expect to accomplish the negotiating gqals if there is reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreements would be voted up or down on their merits. so a set of procedures was developed. the socalled fast track. as has been ed here many times. that fasttrack authority has been extended to every president. democrat or republican. it has been authorized or reauthorized or extended four times. and it is the means by which every major trade agreement since the 1970s has been implemented. in mid1994. fasttrack lapsed. and since then our trading partners. quite rightly. have questioned our ability to stick by a deal. and they have been reluctant to deal with us. some have cited the fact that the administration has concluded all but a handful of 222 trade agreements without fast track. "you dont need fast track. why. we had 222 agreements without it." that is misleading. there are 200 plus agreements listed by the administration as accomplishments. but look at the list. most of the agreements tend to be small. productspecific arrangements like an agreement on ultrahightemperature milk or the list of principles for medical devices. they are certainly important. but they hardly .qualify as major stimuli to our national ecoy. in contrast. the handful of agreements that require fast track are the critical. comprehensive. multisector agreements that address both tariff and tariff barriers. . lets get to this constitutional argument that has been tossed around. fast track represents. it is said. a surrender of congress constitutional duty under article i of our constitution. which says that "the congress shall have power ... to regulate commerce with foreign nations .... " under fast track. congress role in trade negotiations has  been diminished or disregarded. clearly it would be impossible for .435 representatives or 100 senators. all of whom believe they are qualified to be president--indeed. i believe there has been a terrible overlooking that they are  chosen as presidenteach of these individuals could  carry out at the same time our trade negotiations. . what fast track does is it allows the president to carry out the negotiations but imposes strict requirements for ongoing consultations to ensure that congress voice is heard. madam president. it has been my privilege to have served on the finance committee for 19 years . when we have a fasttrack measure come up. there is constant consultation with that committee and other senators on the negotiations that are taking place that subsequently fast track will be asked for. so the israel. canada. mexico. and uruguay round agreements were guided by thousands. literally thousands. of briefings and discussions between the negotiators and members of congress or their staffs. congress will continue to be consulted. so. indeed. we do write the legislation to implement these agreements. and congress authority is  being constitu. tionally revoked or the constitution is  being overridden. madam president. the fasttrack partnership has guaranteed congress continued fulfillment of its constitutional role in international negotiations. . is every member of congress going to be satisfied.  apparently . as we have heard this aftern and yesterday. but will the partnership produce agreements that have taken into account a broad variety of u.s. interests and views. that is absolutely true. i would just briefly like to touch on what happens if we do  approve fast track. that is the argument in the chamber here. do  have it. i k that it is always prefaced by the opponents saying. "im  against free trade." and then they proceed to inveigh against fast track. the united states is the worlds largest trading nation. the largest exporter and the largest importer. we are the giant of the world trade area. we enjoy prosperity today in large part because of our trading activities. this is what dr. alan greenspan said a week ago. on october 29: the quite marked expansion in trade has really had a pronced positive impact on rising living standards. since 1992. exports have been responsible for onethird of our ecoic growth. trade  represents a solid 30 percent of our gdp. and our exports continue to rise. this export activity supports some 11.5 million wellpaying jobs across the nation. they certainly do in my state where we are very. very grateful for our trade and where we believe the opportunities for trade should increase. our exports from small rhode island hit $1 billion last year. with projections for this year estimated at $1.2 billion. state officials in my state count on exports as a key element in our ecoic growth and are aiming to reach $2 billion in exports sby the year 2000. which is only what. 3 years from . if we want to continue this prosperity. we must continue to advance trade liberalization worldwide. in order to do this. we must have fast track. . there is urgency to this. we are seeing the southern nations of this hemispherebrazil. argentina. paraguay. uruguaymount an aggressive effort to develop a freetrade region throughout the western hemisphere. chile. which is more than a little tired of.waiting for us. has completed separate trade agreements with canada and mexico as well as colombia. venezuela. ecuador. and they are reaching out to central america and asia likewise. mexico has concluded agreements with colombia. venezuela. and costa rica. and are talking to the other nations including the caribbean nations. the european and asian nations are getting in on this. both the european union and the southeastern asian nations are courting the south american countries. chinese and japanese officials are eyeing the major latin american nations. the united states is in real danger of falling behind all of this. that has ramifications for american workers and their families. one example that hits close to home for rhode islanders is quaker fabric co.. a fall river. ma. textile firm employing 1.800 workersmany. of them rhode islanders. quaker recently lost a $1.8 million annual contract in chile to a mexican competitor whose product is exempt from chiles 11percent tariff -thanks to the chilemexico trade pact. and quaker was told by an argentine buyer that he was switching to a brazilian fabric supplier whose product. while of lesser quality. is  subject to a 25percent tariff. quakers president tells me that if quaker could just gain equal footing in the region with its latin competitors. the company could boost export sales and add 200 more jobs. it is examples like these that have spurred the national govers association and the u.s. conference of mayors--whose members are keenly interested in ecoic growthto strongly endorse fast track reauthorization. opponents of fast track would have one believe that there are other options than fast track. that is  true. if we want to play in the trade game. if we want to make agreements with trading partners. if we want to continue to engage in the world of trade. we must have fast track. if . we can enter into significant agreements with our partners. and others will quickly move in to fill the vacuumand reap the jobs--we have left behind. in sum. fast track is in the best interests of the united states. it is a necessary prerequisite for negotiations. it is constitutional. and it is critical for ecoic and job growth in our nation. i urge my colleagues to support the pending legislation.
