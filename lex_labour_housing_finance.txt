i thank the senator. s committee on urban housing. and the department of housing and urban development. the proposed homeownership program incorporates features of established programs but emphasizes a new principle. that principle is the concept that homeownership can be of far greater benefit to the poor than a mere roof and four walls. homeownership can be a source of pride and stability. influences that will extend to the homeowners job and family life. in addition. the homeownership program is the first to incorporate features which allow the active involvement of the individual in a federal housing program. through the use of "sweat equity" and through personal responsibility for maintenance and repair. the bills homeownership program and rental program are established on a similar basis. experience has shown that under the 221(d) (3) program the government is able to finance only a limited number of mortgages at the belowmarket interest rate. accordingly. the new programs involve market interest rates. for which private financing is available. and government assistance takes the form of direct assistance and interestreduction payments. these programs incorporate the feature of the rent supplements program which requires an individual to pay a percentage of his income. this feature has the advantage that the individuals payments increase as his income does. but a raise in income does  require his eviction from his home. under section 235. the homeowner would pay 20 percent of his monthly income for principal. interest. taxes. and insurance on the mortgage. the difference between 20 percent of the homeowners income and the amount actually required to meet the mortgage would constitute the amount of the government assistance payment. except that the assistance payment could  exceed the difference between the amount required and the amount which would be required if the mortgage bore interest at 1 percent. under the section 236 rental program. interestreduction payments would be made on behalf of the sponsor to make up the difference between the monthly amount actually required at the market interest rate and the amount which would be required at a 1percentinterest rate. rental in this housing would be established as a basic charge. tenants would pay either the basic charge or 25 percent of their income. whichever was greater. any excess over the basic charge paid would be deposited in a revolving fund. the 236 program offers flexibility in both financing and rental charges which should contribute to the production of housing at a much higher rate.

 i jiope then to hear the senator from alabama and unless he presents something to which i must reply and assume that he will do likewise. i should like to sum up as follows: by  it is well kn that the plan which i have proposed is an alternative to the administrations plan for moderate income housing. my amendment provides for a federal limitedprofit mortgage corporation. which would be financed with $100 million of stock investment by the federal government. the corporation would have power to issue bonds. which it is expected would raise $2 billion from the public over a period of time. the corporation would then lend the money to cooperative entities--foundations. trade unions. and similar organizationsto build model income housing with restrictions on rents and on the admission to that housing being of middle income families and the elderly. my program is to be juxtaposed to the administrations program. which has been much discussed. i think it can probably be best summed up as follows: first. this is the first time we are really considering seriously a moderate income housing program. and the need has been very firmly established. the need extends roughly to 50 percent of american families. so whether my plan or the administrations plan is considered. we would minister to an established need. second. the need is for either rental housing or sales housing which is within the reach of moderate income families. i deeply believe that upon that ground my proposal has the best opportunity for satisfying the need. i should like to state the criteria which i have established in that regard. first. shall it be an experimental program or shall it be the product of experience. of the two programs before the senate. mine is a product of experience. it has been used and tried out in the state of new york for 6 years. it has resulted in the construction of or having under construction 30.000 units as a result of $450 million raised from the public. my proposal is certainly  an experimental program. whereas the administrations 40year. ownpayment program is definitely experimental. representatives of the administration say so themselves. they do  k whether it would work or . second. shall it be a governmental program or shall it be a private enterprise program. the administrations program is a governmental program. it would depend entirely for its viability upon purchase by fnma of all the mortgages which are issued at interest rates below market. and unless such mortgages are issued at interest rates below market. we would  help moderate income housing. because that is the way in which we would save the money which is required to make it housing qualified for moderate income families. my program would depend upon sales to private investors. the government investment is relatively small. so the private ecoic system would carry the responsibility. in addition. it would give us the advantage of having the sanction of private investors acceptance of the proposed mortgage obligations in order to demonstrate that the plan is being operated right. efficiently. and honestly. otherwise. it would  receive that acceptance. if the program did  get that acceptance. the program would  operate. whereas. under the administration plan. if money were fed into fnma. the program would operate even if it were a bad one. third. shall there be a downpayment or shall there be e. many senators are disquieted about the 40year. ownpayment plan. under my program. we would have a provision for a 90percent loan. under the administrations program. there would be a 100percent loan. i think the difference is significant. the reason the plan is viable under my program is that there would be an assured rate of return of 6 percent. whereas under the administrations program. we would  be dealing with that kind of area or sponsor. fourth. shall the program have an opportunity to obtain municipal help. under the administrations program. with the use of fha. there would be hing special about that possibility. except what is provided under the terms of the policy. under my proposed program there would be a unique and distinct effort with a unique and distinct sponsor. which has in the state of new york enlisted municipal cooperation by tax provisions and the power of condemnation. such action is logical because we would be dealing with the sponsoring of a largescale project. deriving money directly from a governmentowned corporation. finally. shall it be expensive or inexpensive. the administrations program calls for an appropriation of $750 million. my program calls for a $100 million appropriation. yet the amount of housing is entirely equal in terms of its potential. we would get at least as much housing. i believe we would get a great deal more under my proposed program than we would under the program proposed by the administration. as we take all of these points and analyze them in terms of the merits of the proposal. we almost come to this conclusion. i make this statement without rancor and without bitter criticism. but i think it is only fair to say that the administration said: what kind of proposal can we dream up that is  like the proposal that was reported out by the committee on banking and currency for moderate income housing in 1960. it dreamed up the 40year. ownpayment proposal with a less than market interest rate and brought it to us. the only distinction it has in any way is the fact that it is different. it is certainly  better. it is much worse in every way that i have described. the only distinction it has is that it is different. i deeply hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will  take a very poor administration program merely because it is different.
